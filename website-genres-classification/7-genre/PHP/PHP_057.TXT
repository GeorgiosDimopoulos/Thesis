From Summer, 1992 through Fall, 1999 I was a doctoral student (and, for a brief stint at the end, a post-doc) in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with Retinal Implant Project investigating nerve cell responses to electric stimulation. These pages document my research at MIT. 
* Ph.D. thesis 
* Ph.D. thesis additional documentation 
* Matlab/DAP software for iridium oxidation (for MIT group) 
* Graduate studies at MIT 
* Contacting the Retinal Implant Project 
From November, 1999 to February, 2002 I worked at ArsDigita on scalable software for online communities. Now I work for myself!
