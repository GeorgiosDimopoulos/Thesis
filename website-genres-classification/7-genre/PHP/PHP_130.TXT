Yes, you've arrived at yet another of the millions of personal websites that clutter up the internet these days. This one just covers me and my life so if you have arrived here because I used the words "sex", "girls", "free" and "naked" in this sentence, you're going to be very disappointed.
If you are a friend of mine, please click on every link you see to boost the hit rate and make me feel justified in wasting my time writing this. If not, feel free to leave before you fall asleep.
This website has been completely re-written recently, partly to re-organise the sections, partly to remove the frames which caused problems for all the people that didn't come in at the front page, and partly to show off with CSS. The new design is pure CSS so it works well in any CSS compliant browser which includes Netscape, Opera, and (my personal favourite) Mozilla. Of course, Microsoft Internet Explorer doesn't handle the CSS standards properly so the site won't look exactly the way it's supposed to in MS IE. Older browsers which don't handle CSS properly will show the content, but the navigation bars down the side won't work, instead the navigation text appears at the top of the page so it can still be used, even though it looks crap. There's bound to be a few mistakes here and there so please let me know if you find one.
If you have an older browser and are wondering what you are missing, I suggest you go to Mozilla and get a copy of the browser. It is perfectly CSS compliant, has no adverts, and has some wonderful features to safeguard security unlike the browser from a certain large American software company.
HomeBack to the front page, just in case you get lost. AboutA little bit about me, and who I am. DiaryThe most often updated part of the site. A collection of things that I've done, and things that have happened to me ContactHow to contact me should you feel it necessary.
