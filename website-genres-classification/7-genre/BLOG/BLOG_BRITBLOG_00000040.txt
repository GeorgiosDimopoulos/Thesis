What the *$&#?  

  
Why do people (read: coworkers or others who have no business asking personal questions) feel the need to ask questions or make assumptions about one's reproduction? I mean, NEVER do I get people asking about how my menses is going, or if it's a light or heavy flow this month. But people feel entitled to ask questions about when one is going to pop out a parasite from their coochal region. I mean, it's NOT okay to ask health related questions in the workplace- and it's especially not okay to ask about questions that involve my health and my sexlife.Case in point.... several people (or relatives of people) in my office are having or just have had babies. At least 4 in a 20 person office. Today, I walk through the break room and hear "with all these babies popping out, you're going to be inclined to have one too!" No. just b/c some people I barely know are having ugly children they can't afford doesn't mean that I will want to have children. Here are the things that would make me want children. 1. a tax break 2. creating a person that would be fricken hilarious and really annoying to my mother 3. to bring another sane minded non jesus freak into the world 4. getting to stay home more and work less.There are 4 good reasons, and none of them involve following in the footsteps of people I barely know and don't want to be like.

Bats in the Cave  
Ugh. I'm sick and have boogers galore. And we have a temp in the office who has walked past my cube twice in the past 2 days and seen me digging at my nose. Once with my THUMB. I won't make eye contact, but instead just keep at it like it's totally work-related.I have one that is VERY small, but it's half-dry and won't detach from the inside of my nose and it's buggin'. When I try to get at it, it just keeps holding on to the baby nose hairs way up in there and won't give way. It is starting to hurt, but I can't let it go til I get it taken care of!And today the zipper on my favorite pair of black pants broke. And the pants aren't even tight! I don't want to go shopping this weekend, but my selection of four pairs of pants has been looking ragged lately and it's probably time to upgrade.I need to go home and get outta these pants.

Lamburger  
So in celebrating our anniversary last night, Stan made me a wonderful dinner. What's with all the cooking, you ask? Don't question a good thing.Stan special ordered rack of lamb from the meat store. Yep. PLANNED AHEAD. Mad props, yo. He then proceded to set them on fire, coming back to the grill to find that they had burned so long that the bones had actually BURNED OFF. Keep in mind that said bones were even covered in aluminum foil (also keep in mind that lamb is only to be cooked to medium rare). I thought it was funny; Stan. did. not. There was more food too- tasty garlic mashed potatoes that rival da Lobster. And a beautiful blackberry semi-fredo (apparently its a combination of custard, merangue, and whipped cream all frozen together) cut into heart shapes and layered between heart shaped dark chocolate and topped with blackberry puree. And candlelight. Perhaps since I was so drunk on our wedding night that Stan didn't get any, he's trying to better his record? Whatever the reason, I'm lapping this up. Especially since it's coming from the husband whose cooking repetoir includes mostly brats and deer sausage.On another note.... has anyone else gotten sick like 18 times this winter? Jesus, I'm sick again. Stuffy nose, sore throat, headache. I NEVER get sick this much- due mostly to incessant hand washing.... another one of my endearing traits.

The best website  
Okay, this is the most wonderous website ever. I have been waiting for months to access it, as its services only became available to those in our region on March 1, but now I did and it was the best 20 minutes I have spent in a long time. And I have to say that it's about time our government did something right. And oh, this is RIGHT.What is this website, you are wondering? It's https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp - the place you can now go once a year to get all three of your credit reports FOR FREE. That's right, now you don't have to pay 30 bucks each or get turned down for a loan or get your identity stolen to see what's on your credit reports. I HIGHLY recommend doing this online, as it only takes about 20 minutes. And the last one (transunion) actually shows you how many payments you have made on time, 30 days late, 60 days late and 90 days late. It's creamworthy.You can pay extra to learn your credit score, but I didn't, as I just found out what it was when I bought the Jetta.If you think I'm a dork, I. DON'T. CARE. Because now I know whether my credit is wonderful or shitty. And I have DETAILS. Glorious DETAILS. Make sure you print shit out though, because you can only access it once per year.

Why I *heart* Stan  
So earlier this week was my employer's annual meeting. People from all over the area come to hear the annual report and get free dinner. It was typical- very boring speakers and fried food. Needless to say that b/c Stan and I are eating so healthily lately, I sampled (ahem, gorged myself) the fried delights on the buffet.I then went home around 9pm to find that Stan...... was cooking me a huge dinner. So my first reaction was to say "Dude, I've already eaten!" But instead I stifled this and said "Wow! What's all this?" 'All this' consisted of homemade whole wheat pasta (Dude, I haven't even whipped out the Kitchen Aid pasta attachement from our wedding presents yet), homemade meatballs, homemade sauce, homemade bread, and homemade vanilla frozen yogurt (noticing a theme there?). I shit you not. Stan spent 4 hours cooking for his wretch of a wife who had already eaten herself silly.So in the span of 3 hours, I ate two full dinners. And by the way, Stan's meal was wonderful. I mean, the man can cook. Keep in mind that this is the same man who put two whole cups of my homemade basil pesto on his MACARONI NOODLES. ANd came up with the "brilliant" idea for HOT DOG LOAF. (I have pictures of this endeavor....)And he still doesn't know that I had eaten before that. You might say, what the hell are you putting this in your blog for, then?!? Well, last night he told me that he has no interest in these blogs (even after seeing that Jesus commented on one) or having a screenname, so now I'm fairly confident. And even if he DOES learn about it, he'll just know how much I *heart* him.It's our anniversary in one week. I never thought I'd be married, let alone HAPPY. Ah, life, it's a corker.

Welcome, New Edition  
Wait, make that new addition. Because I am not welcoming a tired old hip hop group to my household. Instead, I wecome a brand new car.Yep, that's right. After 11 years of driving hand-me-downs, I am now the proud owner of a spankin' new VW Jetta. And, wow, does it feel good to not be driving a 14 year old ESCORT. Not that Leon wasn't good to me, but Wanda will be even better. And, boy, does Wanda know how to treat a girl. Wanda offers me lots of love, and I lap it up like it was dinner. She warms my bum, she showers me with sun through the sunroof, and she has a CD player. Most people wouldn't devote blog time to a CD player, but when you come from a car with no working radio, you learn the horror of hearing yourself think before your morning coffee.And before you all drone on about the stupidity of buying a new car, just know that she is, in fact, a 2004 with only 30 miles, so we got a fabulous discount.I heart her. More that you can ever imagine. But I am not yet set on the name Wanda. Any ideas? Perhaps something German?

Attack of the Needy "Friend"  
Yep, she's back. And this time she's brought kryptonite.Remember the friend (we'll call her Cheryl, cause that's what everyone else calls her) who only calls me when she wants something? If you don't, let me remind you of some of the things that she has asked of me in the past 2 years: throwing her a bachelorette party (for second wedding), hosting her spa day pre-wedding, wearing a size 20 strappy red dress for said wedding when other bridemaid was a size 4 (4 goes into 20 FIVE TIMES), throwing her a party so she could ask MY friends to donate to her fundraising campaign, ask my mom for free real estate contract, watch her dog at MY house for the weekend, have my husband pour a concrete back patio for her (he actually DID it), and now, the kryptonite- help her make all the cards, posters and such for her father's funeral tomorrow.Now, I can't say no to the last request, even through I have said no to several of the others (namely the party, free realtor, and the dog), because a someone with a dead parent is not someone you say no to, and I actually want to help her out in this instance. Because, let's face it, most of us only have one parent now. But most of us had a network of great friends and family to help us through. And most of us have given equally to what we have requested of people.But I have NEVER requested ANYTHING of Cheryl. Nothing. I haven't called her at 9pm with knitting questions. I have never begged her to introduce me to her cute ceramics teacher. I have never requested that she take an ice skaing class with me so that I can show off. I am completely put upon by her all the time (with painful requests) and have NEVER requested anything of her.I know this sounds completely selfish, but I have done so well at saying NO to her lately, and don't want this to open the door to the requests again. I don't want to have to throw her a party when she decides to pop out a baby. And I don't want to ever drive her to the airport.Please tell me I'm not a total bitch. Or tell me I am. Just tell me.
