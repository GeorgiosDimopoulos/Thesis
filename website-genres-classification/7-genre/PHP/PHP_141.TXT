~ TERI ~ 
The Basics
I am originally from California and have lived in Clarksville, Tennessee since January 1980. 
I am divorced. I like to make new friends but with a busy life, it is often difficult. SOMEDAY I would like to again have the security and companionship of another relationship; however I am VERY independent. MEANINGFUL FRIENDSHIPS are most important to me. 
I have 2 children. My daughter is 21. She attends Tennessee State University in Nashville, majoring in political science/pre-law. My beautiful granddaughter was born in March 2003.
My son, 17, is a senior in high school and works part-time. He is a typical teenage boy; which means 1) he eats constantly, 2) he loves the music I can't stand, 3) it takes bribery, threats and trickery to get him to just take out the trash and mow the yard, and 4) he basically ignores me. The world pretty much revolves his beautiful, sweet girlfriend. 
I was born in March 1959. I am 5'5"; meduium length blonde hair; blue or green eyes (depending on the contacts I'm wearing that day!). I am quite outgoing, but painfully shy in some ways; very self-conscious and at times far too self-critical, and often unsure of myself. I am a smoker and a social drinker ~ and I probably drink way too much coffee! 
I am a sensitive and compassionate person. I attended California State University-Fresno, full-time for three years, majoring in Social Work. I am definitely of above average intelligence and rather articulate. Depending on my mood and how tired I am, I can be quite witty and funny! 
I have been employed in the legal field for the past since 1983 and am presently employed as a legal assistant for a non-profit poverty law program. 
My Interests
I have a huge concern for the human condition. I have been active in the Jaycees (Junior Chamber of Commerce) for many years. I am a member of the Clarksville Jaycees, the Tennessee Junior Chamber of Commerce and the JCI (Junior Chamber International; Senator #62224). Community service is a HIGH priority in my life. 
If I won the lottery I would probably become a "full-time" volunteer for many organizations such as the Jaycees, Red Cross, United Way, etc.
Kangaroos have always intrigued me - hence my screen name - and I collect unique kangaroo items. 
Next to my kids and my granddaughter, the love of my life is my little "LuLu LaRoo" ... my little old Yorkshire "Terror." She loves me unconditionally regardless of mood and whether I'm having a bad hair day.
I like cats very much ~ I admire their independence and self-assuredness. No doubt, I probably have too many cats (4)! My son has a big dog. When I say "it's like a zoo at my house" ~ I'm not kidding! 
My Online Life
It amazes me that with a few clicks of the mouse, a myriad of information is available. Being on-line has opened up a whole new world for me. I've met some great people on-line and I've also met some real weirdos. I don't care for chat rooms. 
I like e-Bay and have found many of my unique kangaroo items there.

THE JAYCEE CREED
We Believe ...
That faith in God gives meaning and purpose to human life;
That the brotherhood of man transcends the sovereignty of nations;
That economic justice can be best won by free men through free enterprise;
That government should be of laws rather than of men;
That Earth's great treasure lies in human personality, and
That service to humanity is the best work of life.
~Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable.~ 
~Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday, and all is well.~ 
~Thousands of years ago, cats were worshiped as gods. Cats have never forgotten this.~
