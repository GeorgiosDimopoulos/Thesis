Ah. I was using the very old 2.4.2 kernel when digging up those
notes. :) Unfortunately, stability in the older kernels has been
very spotty.

The option has been deprecated. Here are comments in
net/netlink/netlink_dev.c:

Now netlink devices are emulated on the top of netlink sockets
  by compatibility reasons. Remove this file after a period. --ANK

On a recent system running 2.4.20, I did not enable the netlink
device option in the kernel. However, /proc/net/netlink still
exists and is available via AF_NETLINK sockets.

What is it that you are trying to do? I am able to run the
iproute tools and start zebra with my current setup.
