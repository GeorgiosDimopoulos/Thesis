Welcome to Linux Help! 	January 25th, 2004.   	

Greetings and welcome to Linux Help.

Linux Help was started back in 1997 by myself and a small group of Linux enthusiasts. Our goal was to create a one-stop Linux Help site that was easy to follow and understand. Linux Help is still an active project and we try to keep the content as up to date as possible. If you require assistance please poke around the site and hopefully you'll find what you are looking for. If not, please feel free to use the Help Forums and ask one of the experts!. If you notice anything unusual (broken links, missing images, typos etc) please contact us and let us know. 

As always, thank you for your continuous support!
Joey Olson
Linux Help Administrator.
