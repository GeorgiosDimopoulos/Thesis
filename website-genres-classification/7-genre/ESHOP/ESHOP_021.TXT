The support for June’s 'Absolutely Fabulous' auction has been fantastic with many of Auctionair bidders scooping real bargains – and benefiting Sight Savers International at the same time! 
So, the Auctionair team have decided to support Sight Savers International for one more month. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Bank are again matching the highest bid, £ for £, as part of their 'Seeing is Believing' campaign. Their aim is to raise enough money to restore sight to a million men, women and children. 
It promises to be another absolutely fabulous auction!
