welcome home, little car of mine 
listening to: athlete - yesterday threw everything at me"...you are, first on my list, when everything around is gone, i know..."i have my car back! it looks a bit battered and bruised. it is without the cow on the dashboard. it feels different to drive though. it sounds different too, and i wonder what suffering that little engine has been put through. but basically it's ok. and it's good to have it back again (fingers crossed that nothing else happens to it. i'm resisting the urge to glance out of the window and check it's still there every five minutes...)it's silly, but i don't feel the same way towards my car now either. it's tainted, somehow. i am glad to have it back because i was really missing my freedom and getting pissed off with public transport. but it's just not the same anymore. still, no more 45 minute mystery tours on the bus to/from work for me now i have my car back! yay!

listening to: the bravery - an honest mistake"...don't look at me that way, it was an honest mistake..."i am off work tomorrow, and i intend to do nothing more than sleep all day. and eat occasionally. and hurt my lungs by smoking. and watch TV/DVD's.i don't know what kind of mutant strain of cold virus this is, but i feel increasingly snotty, sneezy, congested, achy, headachy and dizzy with each new day (and there have been seven or eight such days so far, with no end in sight.)in other news, i am still without car. which means i am still using public transport and spending much time waiting in the cold for buses, and even more time travelling around the world on a magical mystery tour before reaching my destination. i keep forgetting my book too, so i spend 45 minutes staring out of the window on the way, and 45 minutes staring out of the window on the way back. dull. very dull...although, sometimes, we do get in-bus entertainment. today it was a bunch of pre-teenagers talking about old their parents are (it seems that 32 is "old" nowadays) and asking each other if they would "suck someone off" for £60. give it a few years, kids, and you'll be doing that for free.and that's about all, really. nothing exciting to tell you about. maybe tomorrow, eh? (but don't hold your breath...i accept no responsibility for any deaths caused, directly or indirectly, by reading this blog.)love y'all.g'night.

introducing... 
listening to: kaiser chiefs - oh my god"...knock me down i get right back up again, come back stronger than a powered up pac-man..."...the coolest, most chilled out, laidback, dope-smokin', indie-rockin' lion ever:his mane is meant to stick up, all spikey-styley, but he's too cool for all that. he favours a scruffier style altogether, and this is why he is my new best friend. he rocks! he needs a name, though.(yes, i know i am sad, you don't need to tell me...)*sneeze*

grace under pressure, continued... 
listening to: starsailor - some of us"...some of us laugh, some of us cry, some of us smoke, some of us lie, but it's all just the way that we cope with our lives..."first of all, take a look at the coolest keyring ever, tm, and just one of the many things it does:secondly, i'd like to thank esther for making me want to listen to my Starsailor CD's, which have been badly neglected of late but have been just the right thing for me to listen to today...very calming...very meaningful.ok.since my last post, things have happened. it's called "life", i guess. it's called "shit happens". it's called "humanity sucks".as i have already written about, my car was stolen last Thursday night; i coped with the situation well; i kept calm, kept my sense of humour, kept a level-headed sense of perspective about it.little did i know what would happen next...so, in a nutshell:Thursday night - car discovered missing, presumed stolen, confirmed stolen, crashed by thieves, recovered at scene of crash, returned to my possession.Friday morning/afternoon - damage surveyed, "could have been worse" attitude, thieves' CD discovered in CD player, CD taken to police for fingerprinting.Sunday night - thieves return, cause more damage in an attempt to steal my car again, i lose my easygoing attitude slightly, feel like a target now as well as a victim.Monday night - police phone me to ask if anyone has a vendetta against me and who my enemies are, police come round to the house (at the exact moment i step out of the shower with dripping wet hair) to ask me further questions.Monday night, late - sister's boyfriend takes my car away to see about getting it repaired, moments later as i begin to drift off to sleep i hear noises outside and get up to look out of window suspecting something else has happened to my car (not knowing that sister's boyfriend has it), i see my neighbour's car is fully ablaze, i call the fire brigade, my sister sees fire from her house and panics, she thinks it my brother's car on fire (which is parked directly next to car on fire), fire engine arrives really quickly, i pull clothes on, run down to sister's house (have never heard her so hysterical, ever) to discover her in our brother's car (next to car on fire, as i said) moving it away from potential fireball, i run to neighbour's house to tell him his car is on fire, but the deaf bastard hears NOTHING and doesn't find out until Tuesday, i have ever-so-brief conversation with a very good-looking fireman, police show up, eventually i go back to bed for a few hours sleep before work.Tuesday - confirmed that car fire was arson as we all suspected, details are exchanged, times confirmed, and i am now totally convinced that it would have been my car and not my neighbour's car that got torched but for the fact that mine had been driven away by sister's boyfriend TEN MINUTES (seriously, it was only 10 minutes) before i saw the fire and called the fire brigade...iamsotired.

the good the bad the ugly 
listening to: motorhead - ace of spades"...you know i'm going to lose, and gambling's for fools, but that's the way i like it, baby, i don't wanna live forever..."the good:diet coke with lime (i'm still lovin' it!)buses turning up on time.the brief appearance of the sun, heating me up through the windows of the shop.cheesy rock music. loud!the bad:the utter confusion about what day it is (yesterday felt like a Saturday; today like a Friday).buses going halfway around the world before getting to where i need to be.the rain. the rain. the rain. and the biting-cold wind.spilling yogurt down my sweater this morning, and then spilling juice down it at lunchtime.the ugly:the knowledge that i am in the early stages of a nasty cold.

grace under pressure 
listening to: the killers - mr. brightside"...it started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? it was only a kiss, it was only a kiss..."never again can anyone accuse me of not staying calm in a crisis (although i have never been accused of this anyway, but just to prove it behind all doubt...)yesterday, after a visit to Wales to see snakes and scorpions (but not a single sheep) at my friend's house, i got home at around 5:45. after a quick dash around the house, showering, getting changed into fresh clothes, collecting muffins and a DVD, i stepped out of my front door at 7:00 to set off to another friend's house....and my car was not where i had left it parked, on the road, directly outside our house. i looked at the empty space for approximately 1.5 seconds, stepped back inside the house and said "Dad, my car's gone" in a very calm (maybe too calm?) tone of voice.yes, my car was stolen sometime between 5:45 and 7:00. one of my first thoughts (after wondering if i was crazy, or had parked somewhere else) was that my little soft-toy cow was in that car! poor cow! sitting there on the dashboard, in a stolen car. the police were called, the car reported stolen, crime incident numbers written down, warnings heard of £100 recovery fees if they found the car.so, my car had just been stolen...i was completely calm, while my parents were cursing and in shock, and i phoned a taxi so i could still go to my friend's house! about an hour and a half later, i heard that my car had been found, crashed into a wall outside the local shops. a witness saw three teenagers/young men in hooded tops run off up the road, one returned to take something out of my mashed-up car. another witness gave a name of one of the joy-riders but was too scared to give an official statement, so i don't think much will come of that.my sister's boyfriend went to collect my car (using a screwdriver to start the ignition - it scares me a little bit that he really does know everything about cars, including how to break in and steal them!) and persuaded the recovery-guys to waive the £100 recovery fee, even though it was "already in the system" (genius! that saves me £100, at least) and it is now parked on my sister's driveway, with the front bumper all mashed-up, a dent on the bonnet, the steering column completely fucked, etc.amazingly, my tax disc was still there.the cow, however, has been taken by the thieves as a memento of their latest joyride. those bastards better treat her well...my cute little bovine travelling companion...but i have visions of her being mutilated and burnt (which is probably what would have happened to my car, if the idiots hadn't crashed it first.)and throughout all of this, i have remained calm, i have managed to find quite a lot to laugh about, i had a good night at my friend's house until late into the night, and i just hope it doesn't cost me too much to get my car back on the road. in the meantime, i've taken the day off work (i'm not sure why exactly, but i just felt like i needed another day off) and it's back to public transport for me 'til i get my car back (*groan*)and that makes me really wish i had an iPod. because, without the car and the CD player, travelling to and from work by bus would be so much more enjoyable if i had one...but maybe i'll finally get chance to finish the book i'm reading, instead.you see? calm in a crisis.grace under pressure.(R.I.P. Little Un-Named Cow That Sat On The Dashboard Of Angela's First Car, September 2004 - March 2005. i'll never forget you...)
