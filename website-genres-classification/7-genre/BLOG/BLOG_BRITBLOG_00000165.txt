2 am on a Wednesday morning. (night?)  
We can be heros for just one day. (Hero - The Wallflowers)I'm tired. It's been a long day. There was food and there was a book... posted by Mashster at 1:58 AM 0 comments

Heylo Heylo.  
It has been ages since I've ranted on my blog - or so it seems. I'm mellow. Heh. Camel Lights are 'mellow' - so the pack says. Heh. That discovery has made my day. It really hasn't been much of a day. A lot of sleeping. A lot of classes. A lot of ranting. And now it's over - sort of.Slept on a couch in the lounge from 2:00-4:00. I'm usually not good at that - sleeping on the couch in the lounge - too many distractions, too many people passing by. But I was exhaused, so it worked out. At 4:00 a friend of mine 'discovered' me and helped me stumble to Usman and Sid room where I laid claim to Sid's bed for another three hours. It was great. :)"I'm waiting, I'm waiting, for you." (Milk - Garbage)I think - that I spend the vast majority of my waking hours pining for 'something' - only I'm not quite sure what that something is.Aaggh. (That is a rather frustrated and somewhat resigned 'Aaggh' as opposed to a furious one.)There is work to be done. Papers to be written. Reports to be compiled. Sleep to be had. posted by Mashster at 11:40 PM 0 comments    
A happy-ish picture. (Studying in the lounge tonight - Let's get this shit over with.)  posted by Mashster at 12:29 AM 0 comments

Pictures Pictures Pictures...  
Kate has a scanner! And I have pictures. Go figure!I have the most adorable picture of my parents from this summer. They're both beaming and it's wonderful. :DHeh. It is SO unbeliveably cute! (And I am NOT The sort of person who uses the word 'cute' lavishly.)I can't keep myself from starting at it. Screw the over-due takehome - I just want to look at my parents... posted by Mashster at 6:08 PM 0 comments

PLANS:  
It has been AGES since I have said, and meant it when I said: "Koi plan banaoo/ Let's do something."Do you remember when: ...I miss you all. My crazy crazy school friends. We ROCKED the world back then, or rocked Lahore at least. It has been great. It really has.So much to say, so much to say, so much to say...On a seperate tangent:My mind has shut off. I've had a great day, but now, I'm in a crabby don't-really-give-a-shit-mood - Meh. posted by Mashster at 10:09 PM 0 comments    
I wanna get me a little oblivion baby.  
Today is a lets-post-as-many-pictures-as-I-possibly-can-until-I-start-feeling-guilty-about-posting-people's-pictures-without-asking-their-permission-before-doing-so day. I think that the limit has been reached. :) posted by Mashster at 9:22 PM 0 comments

Saturday.  
It's Saturday. 5:00pm on Saturday. I've been up for a little less than two hours. Have a takehome to write - a somewhat-overdue-takehome. But I've slept for one day straight, have had a bath and am having tea - so getting it done shoudln't be too much of a problem - I hope.Can't wait for midterms to be over. Can't wait to go lie down in my 'garden' and read something other than the stuff I need to read for class. Can't wait for Spring break! Spring break spent hanging out with Kamal - cooking and doing 'other' things. The sun is streaming in through the window - reminds me of home. posted by Mashster at 5:00 PM 0 comments

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over.  
I'm in bed! Yaay! Home and bed. Doesn't get any better than that. I even had free breakfast courtesy the Anthro Lab - 6 doughnut holes :P~ AND free lunch, courtesy the CSO. Who cares if I blanked out on the test - I got food and I'm in bed. I know I wanted to write more, but not now. When I wake up, possibly after I talk to my brother... posted by Mashster at 2:23 PM 0 comments    
It's 8:03am and I can't wait to go to bed.  
None of what I'm reading/cramming makes any sense now. There are castes. Good. What now? The castes are unrepresentative (did I just butcher that word(??) of the actual social situation of India. Blah blah blah.Redford and Krober have a model. Only I don't know what it is. No wait. I do. It's the folk-urban continum. My 11 year old cousin is moving from a folk culture towards a more urban culture - so the folk-urban continum model would suggest. I, on the other hand, would suggest sleeping.Dull - is the word that best describes my current mental capacities. I am also slow and I think that there is too much light in this room.2.75 hours to go.Another 20 minutes till I can have free tea/hot chocolate from the Anthro Lab... posted by Mashster at 8:03 AM 0 comments    
My eleven (possibly twelve), year old cousin's MSN nick is: "me hoT???!!! TOTALLY!!!! (K)(K)"  
I am not sure how I feel about that. This world moves too fast for me, I think. :P~ posted by Mashster at 5:56 AM 0 comments    
Crazy week running into a crazy weekend.  
(A bunch of disjointed thoughts penned down in my sleep deprived 6:00am state.)I'm done. Enough with the cramming. Enough with the cramming for the next 15 minutes at least. I'm tired. Stupid lab. Stupid food. I want fruits. I want sleep. I want coke (?). Hmm.. come to think of it, I haven't had coke in forever.The exam is at 11:00. I can't wait to be done with it. To be done with ita nd then go to work and then to another class. Or to be done with it and head home and sleep! can't decide which one I want to do. I just chatted to one of my punk-ass Tennis kids. He is adorable, only he'll kill me if I tell him that. He wants to know if I'm coming home this summer - I told him I "MIGHT". The big 'Might'. Maybe. Maybe not.I want some coffee. Only I have no idea where one gets coffee from at 5:40 am. Hmm.. I have spent more time in this lab this week than I have at home. Wow. I hate exams! I'd rather write papers. Or take easy exams. :P~Take. Not Give. Someone taught me that ages ago. I took the SAT, I'm taking the exam... Don't take-ofy me(?) :P~Heh.I have TWO papers to write this weekend. I am a bit screwed. But Friday afternoon/evening/till-half-way-through-the-night I am sleeping! Yaay sleep!I slept.. 4 hors last night and wrote a paper. A pretty good paper, or at least it seemed good to me.Been awake since then - wasting time, studying, blogging, but not posting half my posts since they sound crazy. Wondering whether I am a sad person. I'd like to think I'm not. Been asking my brother if I'm a sad person - he laughed. I'm not sure where that leaves me. We decided we'd talk about it later - my possible sadness. I really don't think I'm sad. I am frustrated and confused, but not sad. My crazy oober-functional brain has a mind of its own and should not be left by itself. Hence the drastic difference between my morning and night selves. It's almost 6:00. My 15 minutes are up. Will post more later. Will toast more later. (I had toast today - toasted toast.) posted by Mashster at 5:36 AM 0 comments    
My blog is NOT sad, and you can't convince me otherwise.

School - Three/Four Years ago. (Wearing that sweat shirt right now.)  posted by Mashster at 4:33 PM 1 comments    
And I'm thinking about:  
- How great it is to be South Asain :)- Whether I really want to get married?- How come it's so easy for me to get extensions? Is it the just-got-out-of-bed-and-hence-must-have-been-up-all-night-(presumably studying)-look, which the perpetually disheveled hair complement? - Maybe I want to learn to make rotis.. - Is there an MSA dinner tonight...- How ridiculous it is that I don't know whether there is an MSA dinner tonight.- How it's great out! :)- How my sweat pants are all soggy. :( - How I had free brunch!- How I have a midterm tomorrow...- How I should study for the midterm tomorrow..- How I might have absolutely humiliated my brother - at least in his eyes- by pulling what didn't really seem like a crazy 'stunt' last night, but in my saner morning mood, seems a bit ridiculous- How different my night and morning selves are..- How I want to run and what I should so with my bag when I run.- How the banana in my bag mushed up :(- How I like my outfit today :)- Whether I want to go to classes tomorrow.- How I have no freaking idea what I'm doing if I don't get the grant I've applied for.- How I should stop thinking about the grant that I've applied for.- When/If I want to go home today...- How long my hair are and how that would make my mother happy.- How I should talk to my brother...- How I need to call Ceradwen! (HOW am I going to call Ceradwen...? Oh! Kamal's cell! yaay.. heeh :))- Whatever happened to my Internet Explorer last night...- How I want to burn Usman a copy of Daira... HOW am I going to burn Usman a copy of Daira.- How it's almost 4:00!!- How I want to sleep..- Whether I should drop by Usman's room...- Whether my blog is sad. I'd like to think otherwise.- How I haven't hung out with my housemates in forever!! (That's actually a bit disturbing...)- How snowflakes taste weird after you've eaten Altoids.- How I think I've lost weight and how that is a bit disturbing...- How I need to end my rantings... posted by Mashster at 3:38 PM 0 comments

Long before these crowded streets, here stood my dreaming tree.  posted by Mashster at 6:42 PM 1 comments    
Likhay hain yadoon kay safhay...  
Today is a study-like-crazy day, only I haven't started on that yet. I woke up at 4:30pm, which really isn't a big deal for me. Screw classes :P~ Heh.My playlist is wonderful. Hmm.. I'm tired again and my tea is cold. Is is odd how many desi habits I've acquired being away from home. I have morphed into a tea-chugging, paranda-wearing, Paki-food cooking, Urdu-music appreciating ABCD (ABCD (?)). Sagar ke in lehron say gehra hai mera pyar;Sehraoon ke hawaoon pay kaisay aaey ge bahar?...Gum ho gayay kyun; Kho gayay ham....Andhi ho ya tuhan ho, Meray man mein rahay tu sada;Koi apna ho ya paraya ho osay dhoondon mein kahan?Here's another song for you:Na tu aaey ge, Na he chain aaey ga.Meray angan ke hare belon ka patta patta sokhta jaaey ga.Urdu, is such a gorgeous language. It's amazing how you, or how I, never realised that when I was young. Now I want to listen to it all day. Not the what's-it-called version, not the one you hear spoken on the street by people like me. People like me who sprout out words and sentences in which English and Urdu run into each other as if the two were never distinct - Take-ofy; Poondofy; Yeh dil mangay more; Tension nahi lainay ka... I want the version that my grandfather who grew up in Lucknow speaks. I want Ghalib and Mir and Azad and the rest of the lot. I think, most of all, I just want to freeze time and go home. Go home to how home was like ten years ago. Not the crazy home that it is now. No when English and Urdu spill into each other and everyone's so cool and hip in their three thousand ruppee FCUK and DKNY shirts. I want to sleep, to go home, to have some more tea without having to get out of bed, to have ras-malai...Home. I want to be home. Home where I have a new bed! A new bed which I haven't seen yet...Crazy how one can have two beds, two rooms, two wardrobes, two of one's own self...I'm done being my American self. I want to be my home self now... posted by Mashster at 6:31 PM 0 comments
