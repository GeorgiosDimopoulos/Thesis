 I'm Jim Davies, a cognitive scientist in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I just defended my dissertation. 
You can see my CV, research statement, and teaching statement. I've accepted a Postdoctoral Fellowship with Janice Glasgow's Molecular Imagery Laboratory in the area of visual and spatial reasoning. 
My Georgia Tech advisors were artificial intelligence researcher Ashok K. Goel and philosopher of science Nancy J. Nersessian. I have certificate in Cognitive Science, and I have a masters in experimental Psychology. 
At tech I worked with the Design Intelligence group, Intelligent Systems group, the Artificial Intelligence laboratory, and program in Cognitive Science. I are investigate problem solving using visual thinking, diagrammatic reasoning, and visual analogy. 
I also did anthropological work in Biomedical Engineering laboratories, investigating learning and cognition in this new interdiscipline. I have also done some research in education, and maintain the Cognitive Science Summaries webpage.

Past: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The summer of 2000 I worked at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs with Chuck Rich and Neal Lesh designing an intelligent tutoring system based on the Collagen collaborative agent architecture. 
I earned a Masters degree during my first two years here in the School of Psychology, where my advisor was Dorrit Billman. We did research in categorization. My masters research showed that when learning new categories, people will assume that the same attributes that are important in other categories will be important in the new ones. 
In the summer of 1997 I worked as a graduate research assistant in the Nonproliferation and International Security Division (NIS), in the Space Data Systems Group (NIS-3) at Los Alamos National Laboratory in beautiful New Mexico. I worked with Mark Galassi. I did some UNIX system administration, web page design, and worked on a statistics package for the GNU Scientific Library, which will eventually be used with the GNU Data Language (GNUDL). I also did some neural network research, and I wrote an X front end for it in STk. 
I had a research assistantship in 1997 to 1998 with Janet Kolodner at the EduTech Institute. I developed assessment rubrics for science and rhetoric write-ups from middle-school children, scoring and coding design projects, and helped create educational interventions that use learning by design principles. 
In 1994 I worked at Los Alamos in Computer Research and Applications (CIC-3), working with Timothy Thomas. We did research with computerized text retreival, using the n-gram method, for the Physical Review OnLine Archives (PROLA). The summer of 1995 I was working with the same group doing graphic design. 
I lived for a year and a half in The People's Republic of China, studying Chinese Language and culture. 
I got my BA in philosophy at SUNY Oswego. 
I grew up in the Adirondack Mountains in Lake George, New York. My parents are happily married in Glens Falls.
