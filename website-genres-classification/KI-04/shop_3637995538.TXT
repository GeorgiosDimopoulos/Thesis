Silence and dust: 9/11 memorial, 2002
At a one-year memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, rescue workers, firefighters and police officers surrounded the windswept circular memorial that was set up at Ground Zero. 
Relatives of victims placed photographs, flowers and other mementos inside the circle.
