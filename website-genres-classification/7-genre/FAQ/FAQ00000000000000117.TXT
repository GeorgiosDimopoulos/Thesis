Unearned income includes taxable interest, dividends, capital gains, and trust distributions of interest, dividends, capital gains, and survivor annuities. If you had an investment loss, your unearned income could be a negative amount. Second, your earned income was more than $4,750. Earned income includes wages, tips, taxable scholarship and fellowship grants, and salaries. If part of your earned income is from tips, see Tax Topic 402 , Tips . Third, your total income was more than the larger of $750 or your earned income (up to $4,750) plus $250. If you file Form 1040EZ (PDF), Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers With No Dependents , your total income is the same as your adjusted gross income. If you are 65 or older, or married, refer to the instructions in your tax package or Publication 929, Tax Rules for Children and Dependents, or Publication 501, Exemptions , Standard Deduction, and Filing Information .
