OBJECT ID CHECKLIST 
Take Photographs
Photographs are of vital importance in identifying and recovering stolen objects. In addition to overall views, take close-ups of inscriptions, markings, and any damage or repairs. If possible, include a scale or object of known size in the image.
Answer These Questions: 
Type of Object 
What kind of object is it (e.g., painting, sculpture, clock, mask)? 
Materials & Techniques 
What materials is the object made of (e.g., brass, wood, oil on canvas)? How was it made (e.g., carved, cast, etched)? 
Measurements 
What is the size and/or weight of the object? Specify which unit of measurement is being used (e.g., cm., in.) and to which dimension the measurement refers (e.g., height, width, depth). 
Inscriptions & Markings 
Are there any identifying markings, numbers, or inscriptions on the object (e.g., a signature, dedication, title, maker's marks, purity marks, property marks)? 
Distinguishing Features 
Does the object have any physical characteristics that could help to identify it (e.g., damage, repairs, or manufacturing defects)? 
Title 
Does the object have a title by which it is known and might be identified (e.g., The Scream)? 
Subject 
What is pictured or represented (e.g., landscape, battle, woman holding child)? 
Date or Period 
When was the object made (e.g., 1893, early 17th century, Late Bronze Age)? 
Maker 
Do you know who made the object? This may be the name of a known individual (e.g., Thomas Tompion), a company (e.g., Tiffany), or a cultural group (e.g., Hopi). 
Write a Short Description 
This can also include any additional information which helps to identify the object (e.g., color and shape of the object, where it was made). 
Keep It Secure
Having documented the object, keep this information in a secure place.
