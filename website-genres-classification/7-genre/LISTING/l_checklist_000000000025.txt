The Parental Involvement Checklist
=====================================================================
 
A Checklist For An Effective 
Parent-School Partnership
---------------------------------------------------------------------
One way to start improving your school's parent-school partnerships is by assessing present practices, says Joyce Epstein at Johns Hopkins University. The following questions can help you evaluate how well your school is reaching out to parents.
* Which partnership practices are currently working well at each grade level? 
* Which partnership practices should be improved or added in each grade? 
* How do you want your school's family involvement practices to look three years from now? 
* Which present practices should change and which should continue? 
* Which families are you reaching and which are hard to reach? 
* What can be better done to communicate with the latter? 
* What costs are associated with the improvements you want? 
* How will you evaluate the results of your efforts? 
* What opportunities will you arrange for teachers, parents, and students to share information on successful practices in order to strengthen their own efforts?

The Parental Involvement Checklist and 
The Six Standards of Parental Involvement
STANDARD 1 - VOLUNTEERING 
GOAL: Recruit and organize parent help and support
  
 SAMPLE BEST PRACTICES
* Distribute Project Appleseed's learning compact known as the Parental Involvement Pledge to recruit and organize parent volunteers. 
* Distribute Project Appleseed's Parental Involvement Report Card. The Report Card is intended to help parents evaluate their contributions to their child's success at school . 
* Use the Parental Involvement Pledge Volunteer Information Survey to identify all available talents, times, and locations of volunteers. 
* School and classroom volunteer program to help teachers and administrators students and other parents. Parent room or center for volunteer work, meetings, resources for families. 
* Class parent, telephone tree, or other structures to provide all families with needed information. 
* Parent patrols or other activities to aid safety and operation of school programs. 
Findings from the U.S. Department of Education's Prospects Study (1993) reveal that students in schools with pledges or learning compacts in place perform better than children in similar schools without them because of greater reinforcement of learning at home. Furthermore, effects of the pledge on student learning were stronger than effects from other forms of school-home interactions.
  
Challenges 
* Use the Parental Involvement Pledge to recruit volunteers widely so that all families know that their time and talents are welcome.
