After a long hard 5 year battle with ovarian cancer, my mother Karen D. Davidson crossed over at home around 10pm. She was everything a Son and a Husband could ever ask for. She would do anything for me and my dad, and for anyone she called her friend. She will be greatly missed. 
She will be buried at Cresthaven cemetery, just past the white river bridge on Old Road 37. We will know her exact location soon.
