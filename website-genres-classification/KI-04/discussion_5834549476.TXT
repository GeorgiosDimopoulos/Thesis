He means registration, thats a little different from activation...in that case look in your registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion Regdone = 1 As a disclaimer this has nothing to do with piracy, it is posted at Tweaktown and I don't think that it even does anything.
