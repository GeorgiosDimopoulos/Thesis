Curriculum vitae

Örjan Ekeberg received his MSc degree in engineering physics and applied mathematics from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in 1981. After a few years as head of the systems engineers group at the department of Numerical Analysis and Computing Science (NADA), he took up his studies and received his PhD degree in computer science in 1992. He was part of forming the neural network research group SANS in 1987 and has been a member of that group since then. He was appointed assistant professor (universitetslektor) in 1994 and associate professor (docent) in 1996. 

Research activities

Örjan Ekeberg has been involved in the development of both artificial and biological neural network models with an emphasis on the integration of these two lines of research. His thesis work was on biologically realistic computer simulation techniques used in the study of swimming patterns. Parts this work was done in close collaboration with the Nobel Institute for Neurophysiology at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm. He has developed a number of simulation packages for numerical neuronal simulations, in particular the SWIM simulator, currently used by several neurophysiology departments in Sweden and abroad. He is now developing the techniques to do the integrated neuro-mechanical simulations necessary when studying the neuronal control systems that operate in close contact with the environment. 

Teaching

Örjan Ekeberg is responsible for two courses: 

* The second course in computer science for the students in engineering physics. 
* The course on artificial neural networks and other learning systems open for students from several programs. 

Private
