"re not a monster.”







“Shut 




up!




” 




Draco roared, flames bursting from his mouth to lick across the ceiling. 




“When Voldemort cast a killing curse at you, your mother's love saved your life. My mother's love turned me into 




this




!”




Harry reached out and caught Draco's hand and didn't let go, even when one of Draco's nails scored across his palm. “I'm sorry. Draco, I'm so, so sorry.”




 Draco exhaled sharply, and lowered himself to press his forehead against Harry's. He was very warm. 




“I did it for you, you know. I betrayed my family for you. Maybe that's why her spells failed. She knew I'd betrayed them.”




“No. No, Draco. Your mother loves you. I know, I know you don't want to talk about her, but I see her every week. We – we have Sunday tea together. She talks about you all the time. She never meant for this to happen, and neither did I.”




“But it did. And now I'm a – I don't know what I am. Something like a dragon, and something like a nāga, but mostly I'm just 




hungry




. I hate it here. I'm so lonely, Harry.”







“I'm sorry, Draco. I'm so sorry.”






 He held Draco in his arms as best he could while Draco cried hot, bitter tears into Harry's chest.






Quatuor






 The next time he went to visit Draco, he brought the wand he'd won from him so many years ago, when Draco had still been undercover in Malfoy Manor. That had been right near the end, when Voldemort had finally realized someone was spying on him, and turned on Draco in a rage. Narcissa's protections, combined with the house magic dedicated to protecting the Malfoy heir, had saved Draco's life, but the spell had twisted horribly, and turned Draco into what he was now. It had turned into an utter brawl, Draco wreaking vengeance in his new form, and Narcissa had slipped away to send an urgent Patronus to Harry, begging him to save her son.



The Order had stormed the Manor, and Voldemort had been vanquished, but there was nothing they could do for Draco. Much like Harry's scar, it was a magic that could not be undone, and Draco had fled into the rubble of the Manor, and refused to come out. They'd had a trial for him in absentia, and Harry had fought tooth and nail to keep them from labeling him a traitor. He'd presented all the evidence they had of Draco being a spy for the Order, and he and Snape had grudgingly been given Orders of Merlin after the fact. Snape had fallen at the Manor at Draco's side, and knowing what he knew now about Snape and his mother only made Harry feel more terrible.

There was a great deal more argument about whether or not Draco should be allowed to remain at Malfoy Manor, who the property now belonged to, and most especially what they should do with Draco's wand. It was eventually decided that they would not try to rout Draco from his lair, but neither was he allowed to leave the grounds. Having his wand returned was still a legal matter pending before the court, and after all this time it was likely to remain in appeals for as long as Harry remained alive, after which it would be swept aside in a pile of political tape.

Before he'd even had the chance to present Draco with his wand, or the two recently shorn sheep he'd brought him, Draco slithered out from his usual hiding place and said,


“There are Muggles in the dungeon.”


Harry nearly dropped the leads on the two suddenly terrified animals. “There are what?”

Draco slithered nearer, inspecting the sheep closely. When fixed with Draco's stare they ceased their bleating and stood practically frozen. He turned to Harry and stroked one finger down Harry's cheek. He couldn't help it, he practically shuddered at Draco's touch. It had just been so long.

 “I was out on the grounds, hoping to get some nice squid from the lake, or maybe a sturgeon or two -”Draco scowled at Harry's expression, “Surely you don't think I eat people all of the time, do you?”

That was exactly what Harry had thought.


“Whatever. I was out hunting, minding my own business on my own damn property, when I found Muggles, fishing in my lake. Muggles! There are mermaids in my lake, Harry. Mermaids, and giant freshwater squid, and all manner of things Muggles shouldn't be allowed to see. And then of course they saw me, and that's when the screaming started.”


“Why'd you put them in your dungeon?”

“What the hell else am I going to do with them? I didn't have my wand, so I"
"full of rubble, buildings toppled and streetlamps barricading the roads haphazardly.

You’re here reluctantly, only present after five different people who you are at least seventy percent sure you can trust have told you to come here.  A new information source, they (Kingsley Shacklebolt, Dean Thomas, Narcissa Malfoy – trustworthy the moment Draco was killed in front of her – Nymphadora Tonks, and Ginny Weasley.)

(Ginny died three days ago, but that’s irrelevant and you can’t afford to think about anything that doesn’t matter andwhendidGinnynotmatterwhatishappeningwhywhywhy-)

“Granger?”

The voice is raspy and quiet and that doesn’t matter because you’d flinch as violently as you just have if it’d been loud and brazen or melodious and smooth. 

The cloaked, hooded figure steps closer as you back into an alleyway, forcing confusion (feigned) and fear (real, oh so real) onto your face.  “I’m sorry, who are you?”  Your voice is quavering, even as that cold, calculating part of your mind is judging the proximity to the Centre, trying to determine just how much wandless magic (don’t forget to take into account wasted output, uncontained radiation) you can get away with while still avoiding detection.

But then the figure huffs, and crosses its arms in a gesture that’s oddly familiar, even through the haze of the last two months.

“Honestly, Granger, you haven’t gotten any better at lying, have you?”

“You’re dead,” you repeat despite all evidence to the contrary, tripping over rock shards and mannequins, tree branches and power lines as you try to keep up with Draco (Malfoy, you correct yourself, because you could only call him Draco when you knew he was dead and you were still feeling guilty about thinking of him as an annoying little twat.)

From the roll of his eyes that you feel without seeing, he obviously seems to agree with your mind, which keeps telling your mouth to shut up because dead people don’t walk and talk (and they don’t tend to have smooth skinned marred by horrific acid burn scars and deep claw marks that still expose bone despite layers upon layers of healing magic). “Clearly, I’m not.  Now shut up, Granger, and keep moving.”

Where are we going?  The words die on your tongue, unsaid, as you round the corner.

No.  Please, no.  Your left hand flies to your pocket – useless, your wand is broken you idiot! – and by the time you’ve collected yourself to reach out through the barrier of wandlessness to your magic while attempting to stagger backwards, it’s too late.  Something grips your limbs, takes hold of your muscles and drains them, leaving you loose and pliant, with just barely enough control to lean against a rough stone wall, painfully aware of the fact that you can’t feel your magic as anything more than a barely-audible, distant murmur.

Untouchable.

“Who was it?” you manage to ask quietly around the lassitude, voice flat and expressionless like you imagine your face to be.  He glances back at you, and you catch the barest glint of pity in his eyes.

“Isn’t it obvious, Granger?” Draco says gently.  “All of them.”

“Good work, Draco,” a voice says warmly, and Draco bows his head before looking at you one last time.

The corner of his mouth twitches upwards, a sardonic, hollow grin.  “Sorry,” he whispers before bowing again and stepping away, making to leave you, alone in the empty Colosseum-esque arena you find yourself in.

“Ah, Draco.”  The voice is still pleasant and fond, but you can sense what’s coming in your bones.  “I don’t believe you’ve been dismissed.”

Your old school rival can sense it too, you know, because there’s a muted despair in his eyes when he turns around, as your eyes flicker in between him and the other.  “My Lord, you offered me immunity,” he says, even though you can tell he knows it’s not going to work.

“Yes, yes, I did.”  You close your eyes but the beautiful, melodious syllables still thrum through your veins.  “But you know what’s interesting about bargaining with traitors, Draco?”  Almost as an afterthought, you hear a mild “And Hermione, sweetheart, please open your eyes.”

Oh God.  It takes an effort, a long hard effort to force your lids up, and you wouldn’t have if not for the iron in that voice, that horribly familiar different alien voice.  Even when you finally get them open, seeing through a haze of exhausted tears, you don’t look straight ahead; you keep turned towards Draco.

“That’s it.”  There’s smug pleasure in those two words.  “Now, Draco; as much as I appreciate your efforts, how am I going to know that you’re not going to turn out a traitor?  Again, that is.”

"or even worse, accept them) – and you’d follow.

You’ll follow him into death if need be.

Tom Riddle, you think, sounding out the name in your head.

He glances at you, pinning you with his gaze, and you freeze in your seat.

He smiles slightly, still staring directly at you, before looking away and continuing to speak, though you don’t hear what he’s saying.

You don’t need to.

 


II.


Tom Riddle.

 He fucks you the same way he speaks, the way he does everything.  It’s torturously slow, almost clinical, but underscored by a raging heat that dominates and sets your nerves on fire.

“Tom,” you gasp out when you come, and you’re so dazed that you barely feel him freeze inside of you.

Later, as you’re running fingers over his pale skin, he says quietly, “’Tom’ was my father’s name.  A common, disgusting Muggle name.”

Muggle?  “You’re a half-blood?” and it’s so hard to conceal your tone of disgust, but you think you manage.  It’s impossible, that this man, teeming with power and nobility, could ever be so base.

In one fluid movement, he’s hovering over you, hands to your neck; you choke, gasping desperately for air.

“I might look like him,” he hisses coldly (but his rage is burning and it’s so deliciously painful, you can’t help but want more of it), “but I am Salazar’s heir.  Don’t forget it.”

 


III.



Voldemort.



Lord Voldemort.


Death has never frightened you, but he is your Lord (your master your lover) so you don’t tell him that you preferred the name Tom.

Tom is a lover’s name, Voldemort a master’s.

He still fucks you, but doesn’t stay afterwards; he doesn’t linger in bed, doesn’t let you touch his skin (that’s getting paler and paler even as his eyes lose their incongruous soft brown to what looks disconcertingly like the colour of Gryffindor rubies).

But he still spends time with you, still smiles approvingly when you come up with a new idea to convert the stupid sheep that make up the Wizarding world.

Anything for that.

 


IV.


You don’t start off finding happiness in suffering.  Oh, Andromeda (blood traitor whore but always a Black, always your sister) and Cissy might talk about you killing animals; but never for the pain.  You’re curious – how much blood lost before it’s too much, what the inside of a cat looks like.

They didn’t understand, but your Lord does; he recognises where your talents lie, gives you purpose where nothing else has.  He’s your guiding light, through obsequious Ministry officials wanting nothing more than to be seen with you to raise their miserable social statuses.

 


V.


You don’t find happiness in suffering but you laugh when the Longbottoms scream.  You wish their son was here, their little newborn baby that’s off with his grandmother (not that you’re worrying about that, because the next miserable life on your list is Augusta Longbottom).  You want to tear them apart then put them back together, want to find a way to make sure they die over and over till he comes back and then you’ll kill all these blood traitors together, you and him.

 


VI.


Azkaban makes you crazy, perhaps.

But you’ve been insane since you met him.

And that will never change, you vow, as Dementors steal everything from you that made you want to live (everything but him, nothing can take that, and so when you’re rocking backwards and forwards on your pile of straw, you don’t think about your sisters what sisters only him)

Only him.

 


VII.


It’s the happiest day of your life when you realise you’re going to see him again.


And then you do.


He’s not who (what) you remember (no fire just ice, cold and harsh and unforgiving and he was all of those but so much more and you can’t bring yourself to think that-)

But you’re not what you remember, either.

 


VIII.


Bella.  He still calls you Bella, even if his voice is cold and affectionless, even if he doesn’t smile at you like he used to, even if he doesn’t order you to join him in bed.  He trusts you, even if he doesn’t love you (never loved you), even if he doesn’t want you.

Azkaban has ruined you for him, but nothing can ruin him for you.


Only him.


 


IX.


Your spirit lingers, resisting Death’s call and the choice you have to make.  You see his anger when you fall and something in you smiles. 

When Potter strikes him down, when his body falls broken to the ground, you wait.

Nothing rises from the"
"for Remus. His pallor hadn't gotten any better since school, though Remus supposed he was older and stronger and covered in a bloody lot more scars than he'd been then. That could've applied to the both of them.

They were both marked, one way or another. ""It is fortunately a very simple ritual,"" he said using a quill to scratch in a combination of Ancient runes into the soft tallow. ""But it is best to keep questions as simple as you can. You can ask what you wish once we begin, as long as you can stand the wax upon you. Would you believe Muggles try this by dropping it into water?""

""All they're divining is the fate of the water's source. Useful, I suppose, if one is very concerned about water."" He was watching, at least, some mild interest now that Remus as at work on it.

""A sanitized version of when they used to drop it into bowls of blood,"" Remus said as he finished the runes. ""There, that should do it.""

No doubt Severus was surprised he knew about such Dark magic, but he had more than a passing acquaintance. ""Are you ready?""

""Yes."" As he would ever be, and he was ready, waiting for Remus to crouch own closer, no doubt, and light the candle before he asked his question.

""Remember, the longer you can stand the wax dripping on you, the more powerful the divination will be, the more details and accuracy,"" Remus replied looking seriously at Snape. He chose to kneel then and with a flick of his wand, lit the candle, to channel magic within it and hold the flow of his own magic pouring into the candle. He muttered the spell's incantations under his breath, which he always suspected was just a ploy to make sure the wax had started melting properly and then held it over Snape’s chest.

White on white skin the first drop fell, splashing on the skin before becoming more opaque. It did not completely set, but instead flowed into the drop that joined it.

He watched Snape flinch, watching the wax fall on his chest, waiting for a few more splashes before he asked anything. ""Are my loyalties still trusted by the Dark Lord?""

The wax swirled on skin, still hot and fluid and Remus could only imagine what it must feel like as it shaped and sought the truth from bare skin to bare soul. It flowed first into the shape of spider what walked its hot wax body down the curve of the potion master’s abdomen. ""The spider -- spinning a trap with suspicion."" Not a complete answer and the wax dripped again swelling the hot wax pool each time it dropped.

The man inhaled. ""Does whatever is left of Tom Riddle still believe I serve him?"" That was a strange question, a strange wording, but important to the man, as far as Remus could tell.

The spider flowed hot wax into a long thin snake that turned and crawled back up to Snape’s chest. It slithered around his nipple flicking a tongue of stinging wax to lap at them before coiling over jealously over his heart, a trail of livid scalded skin behind it. ""The snake believes a heart is his, a service won through sensual gifts and secret moments.""

Remus felt his own face grow hot. He started to consider what that might actually mean and had to struggle to retain the divinatory magic flow.

""Does whatever is left of Tom Riddle believe I would betray him?"" Not could, no, because Remus was willing to believe that Snape could strangle his own mother one handed while reading a newspaper, but he also found it dubious and somewhat unlikely, even with the capacity. He shifted his footing, and more wax dropped, adding to the fluid heat that was the snake.

The wax had to burn; he could see the red trails on the pale white skin as the snake coiled and moved again. It raised up, the wax flaring into a hooded cobra in attack posture, even as the next stream of wax, surely painful, flowed into the shape of a dragon that seemed to try and usurp that place over Snape's heart. ""The snake believes his rightful place over your heart is shared or usurped by the dragon. A stolen heart could lead to betrayal.""

""Oh, bloody hell."" Snape closed his eyes tightly, and then exhaled raggedly. Remus was expecting him to ask him to stop, but he didn't. ""Now if only I knew what the dragon was supposed to symbolize.""

To Remus's surprise, the wax flowed suddenly down to Severus's navel and a second smaller dragon bubbled up out of the magically fluid hot wax. ""The dragon has young."" Remus watched as it rather alarmingly disappeared downwards out of his immediate sight. ""You have protected the young dragon.""

It had to be Malfoy.

Snape jerked a little, and Circe knew where that wax had gone. His thoughts about it twining and slithering in burning heat around Snape’s cock brought a flush to his cheeks.

"""
"he was happily away from them and really they didn’t cross his mind all that much and he would gladly continue ignoring their existence instead of going back to that horrid place.

 

After quickly trying on a few of the glasses, he chose a frame similar to his old one. It was thinner and better made, but the lenses were still round, although smaller and fitted his face better. They didn’t hide his face; instead they framed his eyes nicely. He requested a charm, which would adjust the strength of the lenses, as his eyesight would get worse over time. He paid a total of 45 Galleons (he had been saving pocket money for an occasion such as this) and hurried back. It was already getting late and he knew Sirius would be livid when he found out what he had done. And he would find out. Harry had locked his room under the pretence of hiding the whole day. Sirius wasn’t an idiot though and he’d more than likely have barged in there by now. Breathing in deeply, he steeled himself for the hell that was to come. Not that he regretted it.

 

 

*

 

 

Stepping out of the fire, he found the house oddly…silent. The lights weren’t on.

Harry walked through the room carefully, fingering on his wand a bit nervously. Nothing in the hallway, nothing in the kitchen. Silence. His breath seemed loud and his footsteps were almost deafening. Swallowing thickly, he went on as quiet as possible, his wand out. Going up the stairs, he stepped as lightly as he could, trying to stop them from creaking as much as possible. There was no sign of Kreacher or Sirius anywhere. His heart started to beat faster and faster; his breath hitched suddenly when he heard a high pitched noise of a door closing somewhere behind him. He stilled for a moment, straining his hearing, but he couldn’t hear any footsteps. His wand hand was starting to shake a bit, either from fear or holding it up for too long, perhaps both. It was dark and he could barely see, every shadow he could see out of the corner of his eyes seemed to be moving, just waiting to jump out at him. Heading towards Sirius’ room, he was desperately willing his whole body to stop shaking, with little success. He was going past his own room when he noticed that the door was open, only slightly. He pushed it open slowly and hesitantly, still not daring to make any noise. The things in his room were knocked over all over the place and the curtains had been ripped off the window together with the rail they’d been hanging on. It was a very unpleasant sight and Harry gulped loudly, the skin on his neck breaking out in cold sweat.

 


It was dark, his Aunt and Uncle were asleep. Dudley too. It was late and he was tired…very tired…his hands were blistered and they felt like they were burning, he’d been scrubbing the kitchen clean all night…his eyelids were falling shut…if he could just sleep for a little while…he shook his head and splashed his face with some cold water. He needed to make the kitchen sparkling clean or else his Aunt would shout at him and tell him how useless he is, a useless freak just like his father and mother…and then Uncle would whip his hands again…if he was lucky…he continued cleaning the gap between the floor and the oven thoroughly, but his hands were so sore already, he could hardly feel them. Only a few more hours and he would be locked in his cupboard again and able to sleep. His Uncle wanted him out of the way while they had guests, so he’d likely not be allowed back out until late the next night. He should probably sneak a little bit of food into his cupboard now, or he wouldn’t get anything to eat for an entire day. He groaned quietly. It was unfair, Dudley could eat all he wanted and then sweets too…while all he got were leftovers. His Aunt always said that was all he deserved and that he should be grateful for whatever they gave him. But today he had seen some other kids at school being picked up by their mums… he was sure none of them were up at three in the morning, cleaning the kitchen while their families slept. He couldn’t help but think it was unfair…suddenly he felt he wasn’t alone anymore. There were eyes watching him in the darkness somewhere…he shuddered, fear taking over. He got to his feet and looked into the shadows behind him…he turned around again and suddenly a pair of hands landed on his shoulders…and then all over him…he didn’t even know what was happening, he couldn’t see…then his hair was pulled back and his Uncle’s face appeared beside him, his moustache grazing Harry’s ear
 roughly. He muttered something 
that Harry didn’t quite understand and 
a fat hand cupped his backside…



 


A hand was placed on his shoulder. He"
"have used it. Maybe then, some of his friends would have survived the First War…

Voldemort looks at him like he’s grown another head. Oh, yeah, he spaced out a little. Overdosing on magic enhancing potions tended to do that. Got a little high sometimes….

“So are you going to kill me now?” he asks with a smirk. The Dark Lord should be happy enough to acquiesce.

“Should I?” Voldemort drawls and puts away his wand instead. Harry gapes and then, after a moment, realises there is a pressure on his mind. Damn it, he’d forgotten all about using Occlumency – hadn’t needed to in years. Muggles aren’t exactly skilled in the mind arts after all, and who else did he have to hide from when they were all dead?

“Damn,” he breathes, but  within moments, decides that he doesn’t actually care. He’d jumped into the Veil prepared to die. Whatever happened now… wouldn’t change anything.

Voldemort takes several moments to look him over. Harry can feel the magic crackling around them and marvels at the feeling or wholeness it brings him. He even marvels at how he’d been stupid enough not to notice it until it was far too late. They could have done such great things together…

The Dark Lord paces around Harry, who is still sprawled out on the floor lazily. He’s watching him carefully, intimately and calculatingly. Every step, something new is decided and Harry knows the fate of this world, of a different future, is decided.

“This isn’t the first time you’ve been here,” Voldemort murmurs, fascinated. Harry just blinks up at the man uncomprehendingly.

“Magic is… timeless,” Voldemort says, sensing his curiosity. Harry’s mind is wide open, though he doesn’t have the strength or the motivation to shield it either way. “It always leaves traces. No matter how much the timeline has been distorted, there will always be traces.

“You’ve been here before, in a different past and a different future. Your indecision and inability to do what is necessary have always brought you back right… here.”

Harry mulls this over in his head for several moments. Really, he just feels tired. He’s had the fate of the world on his shoulders for what feels an eternity, but now he really doesn’t give a flying fuck. He’d tried saving the Muggles, but they’d destroyed themselves and the world around them in the process. Like cancer, they’d spread and burned through every last spark of good in the world until life everywhere had been extinguished. The Wizards weren’t much better. They were selfish and overconfident. They’d spurned the Muggles into action, driving and feeding the flames of their fear. No matter what he’d do, no matter how hard Harry would try…

“Harry, look at me,” Voldemort commands, almost kneeling in front of him. The cool, crimson eyes are a familiar, soothing sight for Harry’s confused, tired mind. “There is another way.”

There is a silence.

“Remember, under the dungeons of Hogwarts, I told you that together we could accomplish anything?” Harry nods numbly, trying to push away the pain these thoughts bring him. Ron, Hermione, Ginny… they all died, torn apart by Muggle weapons. “I did not lie to you. You can still change the future, avoid the inevitable and carve your own path…”

It’s terrifyingly charismatic and Harry wants to believe him. He wants this sliver of hope to hang on to, but it’s too good to be true. He’s scared of losing everything again. Years of fighting and losing had turned him into a wreck, a coward and a liar. If only Dumbledore could see him now!

Voldemort is calm, collected, compelling. The speech sounds almost rehearsed and Harry feels the drop in his gut when he realises that it’s probably because he has said it many times before. How many times? How many times had Harry chosen to condemn the world due to his own unreasonable apprehension to the man who had taken so much from him? The thought makes him shudder. He used to hate Voldemort… no, he thought he had. Hate, strong and consuming, had been unknown to him all those years, until he saw Wizards stripped of their powers, burned from the inside out by their own bodies, unable to cope. He had hated Muggles then. Voldemort’s coldblooded, although relatively humane by comparison, murder of his parents had faded in his mind. He had not known his parents. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville, countless others… he’d known them and seen their last, suffering moments as they begged for mercy.

If he had a chance, however slim, to prevent the slaughter of the people he loved…. He would… Harry strangled the thought right there. He told himself, it would all be over now. He"
"preferable to the female senses than armpit and crotch sweat, or so he’d been told on most occasions.   The sleepy little village felt peaceful, few lights still lit in the windows he passed, while he was wide awake and rarin’ to go, and a wicked smile played about his lips as he thought, She may be in bed, but she won’t be asleep this soon. We both expected the match to go on much longer.  Thus, as he came upon the newly renovated Potter household, the idea filled him to surprise his would-be-wife and proceed to ravish her to within an inch of their lives.  He shrunk both bottles then and slid them into a pocket, a quick, whispered sticking- and silencing charm muting any clinking that could occur. He checked to be sure the perimeter klaxon remained primed around the household and carefully toed his way through it, nudging this way and that past the wards using the field experience acquired during his brief stint as a curse breaker under Bill's guidance several years ago. In no time at all he was on his merry way, door gliding silently shut at his back, tiptoeing past the stairs to the upper floor and the bedroom adjacent it, and through the doorway into the kitchen.  He added two shrunken wine glasses, a bottle of powdered cherries and can of cream from the pantry, and a dish towel for cleaning up afterward into his pockets. Then he made his way around to the remodeled first floor bedroom, alohamora’d the bedroom door and swung it open, beaming, only to stop dead in his tracks at the sight that greeted him.  Ginny sat on the edge of their bed in her soft pink nightie, a gradually filling bucket between her spread legs, her hands wrapped around the finest set of udders he had ever seen on a feathered cow. “Oh!” she exclaimed between motions. The cow mooed distressingly, turning a shapely head that contoured more toward the avian than the grass-eater. Hard fiery blue eyes glared at him.   “Is that…"" a magical cow in our bedroom at a quarter to eleven, what kind of secret kink is this? He decided against blurting that out and asked instead, ""... what is going on?”  Ginny's nimble fingers resumed action, tugging on the fat udders. The cow mooed again rather moodily. ""I know you weren't expecting company, Harry. But she found me at the hospital at the end of my shift and I couldn't just leave her there, not after the ceremony."" Nonplussed at the situation, all he could do was stand there watching. She squeezed, another rich burst of milk gushing into the already too full bucket, and as a result over splash dashed across her pale legs from mid-thigh to ankle.   ""Oh. Dear, won't you lend a hand?"" Ginny reached down to wipe carelessly at the glistening milk with her fingertips, edge of her nightie jumping with the movement.  Harry felt his pulse do a little jig. Thank Merlin this isn't some mad fetish. This isn't the norm and I can get clearer answers later. ""Sure thing, Gin,"" he said.  He took out the towelette in one hand and his wand in the other, a few choice spells loosening his belt and slinging it over the nightstand. He vanished the contents of the bucket without much concern for where exactly it went. Then he knelt down, passed his fiancee the cloth, and took the nearest weeping teat into hand.  Ginny knew how to play her audience. She spread her legs further, leaned back to offer more light, lifted one leg up to better reach her sole, and with his emerald gaze burning intently on her every move Ginny wiped up the proxy for his cum. She smiled wickedly at the rising in his jeans, the rush of his breath, delighting that he was always so pliable after a hard match.  Harry's grip momentarily yanked instead of firmly pulled. In response, the cow's sturdy tail swung ‘round and clocked him on the side of the head. Harry winched at a blow to shame a bludger and lost his balance, stumbling backwards, his hands reaching out for the nearest available surface as he fell - which just so happened to be the front legs of the feathery bovine. His wand clattered somewhere to the side as it rolled away and the cow mooed in desperate protest.  Then they thudded to the floor together, and most of the air in his lungs exploded out in a violent, ""Oomph!"" of protest. But when Harry blinked opened his eyes he found those startlingly bright orbs up close and glaring at him from the hawkish lines of the creature's face, only scant inches over his own. So close that, had he not known better, he would have sworn on his godfather's grave that they really were human underneath.  Ginny stifled a laugh at his consternation. “Oh, Harry, how do you keep getting into these situations?”   He motioned desperately for Ginny’s assistance as he tried to no avail to push the cow up by physical force alone"

But after the death of his wife His father succumbed to the darkness that lies inside of everyone, and the only way to Push it back was to hurt his only son, but the darkness came back. It always came back. So he cut he wings and made sure His bird wouldn't fly away. He kept him caged while other birds Flew away. But No matter what Theo never gave up, He didn't bother to fly atfer all his wings Couldn't hold him. But he never did hate his father, he understood what he had to do So his father wouldn't go crazy. So he suffered, suffered while his friends flew away, suffered when his father beat him, cut his wings, suffered when he Would plead to god- to his mother- to save him, but no one did. Theo wings were the only thing that helped him remember his mother, his wings were her's in a way. But when they were cut his mother started to fly away, to vanish. Theo would reach for her crying, but no matter how hard he reached for her she still Flew away. Leaving him alone in this hell. So he suffered, the person he used to be was gone, he vanished when his mother died and left him alone. He didn't want to be alone as Selfish as it was- he wished It was different. He longed for The old days. He started to give up, atfer all he was a boy with broken wings. Then he met The love of his life who didn't care about his wings, didn't care that he was broken. They fell in love slowly, Like snow falling on the ground. They shared their first kiss under a tree in they shade, they lost Their innocence on Christmas Eve. He didn't care that Theo was damaged. He loved him for all his flaws. A boy with damaged wings found Comfort in the boy Who Had a bad past. They didn't care about the bad things, they only loved each other. Never fought never Yelled. A boy with damaged wings started to Fly with the help of Blaise
"
"younger male replied with a grin and they both slowly got up.

Both their robes were covered in dust all over.

“I think we might need to check out the size of our bathtub now,” Harry said into Tom’s ear slyly and began undressing him with a mischievous grin on his face.

 

*

Harry woke up in the middle of the night, unable to feel his legs. He was absolutely freezing.

“Tom, give me back some of the cover,” he whined, trying to pull it back over himself, to no avail. His lover was wrapped up in the cover like a thick cocoon and wouldn’t budge.

He looked at the clock beside him, it was 5 am. He groaned and got out of bed. Maybe a hot chocolate would warm him up a bit and then he could try to pry the cover off Tom without waking him. Disrupting the Slytherin’s sleep was equal to having a death wish, so he had no desire to do that.

The kitchen was a mess. How had they managed to pile up so many dishes in two days? They had both been busy… Tom was working two shifts each day and Harry was teaching Quidditch at the newly founded Institute for the Education of Young Muggleborns. The brats were incorrigible. They didn’t listen; they had no coordination in their play and no will to learn. It left Harry completely beat each day and doing any housework was the last thing on his mind. Tom usually came back after Harry was asleep so they barely even got to see each other.

He mixed the hot chocolate with milk, his eyes dull and unfocused. He was really tired. If he went back to bed now, he’d be late for work later, since he had to leave at half past 7 to get there on time. The anti-apparition wards around the grounds of the Institute, made it impossible to get there easily.

“Harry?” sounded Tom’s sleepy voice from the bedroom. “What are you doing?”

“I couldn’t sleep because someone stole the whole cover for himself,” Harry glared at his lover accusingly, going back through to their room.

“Well, get in here and go back to sleep. You’re making too much noise in the kitchen,” Tom grumbled. “I can’t sleep when you’re not here.”

Harry froze. He wasn’t sure if he’d heard that correctly. After a minute of contemplation, he smirked to himself. Tom had said it, although he would probably deny it to his dying day. But Harry had heard it and really, he couldn’t even stay mad about waking up from the cold anymore. He climbed back into bed and allowed his lover to drape his arms over him. Delicious warmth spread through his body and he snuggled closer, to feel Tom’s chest rising up and down in calm motions.

 

*

 

“Harry, how many times do I have to ask you to do the dishes?” Tom asked with annoyance, ruining his perfect, lazy, late Saturday morning.

“You can do it, you’re better at cleaning spells than me anyway,” Harry whined, turning his face back into the comfy pillow.

“Perhaps, but I, unlike you, work two jobs so we can live somewhat comfortably. I don’t have the time-“ Tom started and Harry groaned.

“I already do all the tidying and the laundry!”

“Yeah, but you also spend more time here.”

“I’m not your bloody housewife, Tom!” Harry huffed and turned away. A few minutes later, he heard Tom slam the door, leaving without saying bye.

“Hmph,” he curled up in the covers, trying to fend off the fast approaching guilt for taking out his frustration on Tom.

His lover didn’t return until really late, when Harry was starting to worry. Tom had a tendency to stir up trouble when he was angry…

Harry spent most of the afternoon pacing around the room nervously and fire calling his friends to ask for advice on what to do. Ron was useless, as always. Emotional range of a teaspoon, as Hermione succinctly stated after hearing what advice he had tried to give Harry.

She was a much better listener for all his worries and said to occupy himself with something until Tom got back, then simply apologise and talk it out.

Harry knew it was reasonable, but… she has never seen Tom when he was angry. He was downright murderous when something didn’t go his way. When he got like that, it was difficult for even Harry to placate him without risk of injury.

He sighed heavily. All he could do now was to sit and wait.

*

 

Tom’s anger had now been reduced to a slow simmer. He could never really stay angry at Harry for too long. He was on his way back from dishing out some punishment to his misbehaving followers, which, admittedly, helped relieve a lot of his stress.

He… almost felt bad for storming out of their flat in the morning. Harry had been unreasonable, but"
"a lot of shit, right? Like, students doing lots of stuff, saying things, trying stuff out, um… experimenting and stuff?” You nod, wondering where on Earth this is going. It almost feels like Malfoy is about to come out to you, which wouldn’t exactly be a surprise, except for why on Earth he would be telling this to you of all people. “So my so… my… my child, Scorpius, came to me today to… talk about something. And…” Malfoy sighs, finishes his beer, and motions for another. You do so, but switch to the lighter (and amusingly named) Kelpie Spit - after all, once you’ve reeled them in, you don’t want them passing out before finishing the story.

He takes a sip and continues. “Have you… have you ever had a wizard come to class, and then the next day, they’re a witch?”

This is not at all what you expected. “You mean, like with a polyjuice potion?” you ask.

“No, not like that,” Malfoy says irritatedly. “I mean -”

“Well, I have heard that stewing and ingesting horklumps during an eclipse on a rainy dew while wearing a particular shade of chartreuse can cause a variety of amusing effects, including a brief reversal of genders -”

“I’m not bloody talking about pickled horklumps!” he spits, making you glad you started him on the lighter stuff. “Stewed,” you mutter under your breath.

“I mean, the wizard shows up to class the next day and he looks pretty much the same, but he says he’s a witch now?”

Ohhhhhhhh. Now you get it. You must say, your experience in such matters is minimal, though a pleasant but not particularly applied (at least in Herbology - Ancient Runes was apparently a different story entirely) Ravenclaw student in h… his fourth year at Hogwarts started asking to be called simply “Alex” instead of “Alexis”. You didn’t think much of it, but you did notice he- him, wearing more male-oriented clothing (though with Hogwarts dress code it’s not like there’s too much of a difference - he’d never been one to wear skirts anyway), and overheard Madame Pomfrey muttering on about cooking up an usual type of potion for Alex (though Madame Pomfrey did a lot of muttering these days, and usually of the not entirely coherent variety). You tend to let your students be students and just focus on their school work unless they come up to you - and while you’ve mentored many a student in your relatively short but varied time as a teacher at Hogwarts, Ravenclaws have been the most reticent to ask for your advice - even more so than the Slytherins! It probably has something to do with your rather convuluted way of explaining some thi- oh shit Malfoy’s talking again.

“Like, I could understand being into wizards. It’s the 21st century. It’s… it’s a new era. Look at me - I’m, I’m a changed man. I don’t…” he pauses, hiccuping slightly, stares confusedly at his hands for a brief moment, and then continues. Yeeaaah, probably just gonna give him water from this point forward. “I don’t call muggleborns mudbloods any more. I don’t. I promise. And like, we’ve all thought about it. No wizard hasn’t. If they say they hasn’t, haven’t, they’re a liar. And not a cool one like me. A... a, whatchamacalit. A dumb one. I mean, we’ve ALL been there, in the showers after a quidditch match, and you jusht HAPPEN to look over and you know maybe you don’t hate what you see!” Malfoy’s hands are really getting into it now, and he’s starting to draw attention from the few remaining bar patrons.

You do your best to hide a snicker - Ron is gonna love this story (on second thought, he might love it too much - maybe you should keep this one to yourself), and Malfoy manages to somehow combine a scowl and a blush into a single gesture. “The point is, I could understand if he, you know, flew for the other team. But this… I mean, I’m obviously not mad or anything, I just… I - I don’t have any, wazzit called, any rame of feference, any fame of deference, any, any… I just don’t quite get it.” He take another drink, and continues, fortunately with slightly less exaggerated hand motions. “Was I… am I… a bad father? Did I do something wrong? Why’s… why’s my beautiful boy got it in his head that he’s a witch?”

Hoo boy. There it is. You… you’re going to be honest, you really have no idea how to respond. Brief encounters with Alex notwithstanding,"
"swift Finite, looking around at the few scattered implements he still had to put away in his trunk. ""Yeah, Draco?"" he called back as he strode over to the door and pulled     it open. The Malfoy heir stepped in after a moment and looked around   the   rather small guest bedroom, as if seeking something. ""I  see you haven't gotten the train ticket anywhere in sight- which is   good to   see you've remembered- only you haven't gone and misplaced it,   have   you?"" he asked rather haltingly all at once. Harry  recognized it as faint anxiety, and it was good to know that he     wasn't the only one. ""No, I packed it away with most of my books a   month   ago."" He answered. Draco nodded.

""Alright,  then. Breakfast is ready and mother said to  have   everything packed  up beforehand, so we can head out at ten  o'clock   sharp."" His gaze  lingered on the items sticking out like sore  thumbs. Harry nodded in turn.

""Thanks, Draco. I'll be down in a minute."" He    responded and turned  to rush over to his trunk. Draco sighed at the loss    of proper stance  and the haste of his sort-of-cousin- the books were    rather vague and  the Wizengamot hadn't clarified in easily digestible    terms. At best, it was Draco's own mother that was Harry's nearest-cousin,   just   as it was Harry's godfather that was his own nearest-cousin. What  they were might not even technically count by law given the distance between their respective branches. Whatever the case was, however, they were still relatives, and Draco     respected that and the effort Harry was making to adapt to their way of     life. He waited until the last book and the clock were set  nearly-neatly into    the trunk at the foot of the bed and then shut  before he stepped up  to   help drag the lumbering weight down the  stairs with him. Harry smiled gratefully.

 

 

 

Apparition was among the worst sensations Harry thought he would ever    encounter. He gasped and nearly collapsed to the ground when they    arrived on the platform, shrunken trunk in pocket.

Draco helped to steady him even though his own eyes were wide and  nearly   stunned from the feeling. It was unlike the effect Dobby had  used,   though still near enough for him to have gotten used to. It  seemed Harry   had no such stomach or fortitude for that method of  travel.

Lucius and Narcissa helped prod them along and through the stone  barrier  onto Platform 9 3/4ers a few moments later, where several other  earlier  arrivals were standing around chatting.

""Now, Mister Potter, I believe that there is but one further thing in   which you must acquire."" Lucius stated calmly, calling out for the   semi-useless house-elf a few moments later.

Dobby appeared instantly,   bowing and kissing the hem of his masters robes, nearly to the disgust   of said wizard if the sneer on his face was much to go by.

""Take this sack of gold and select two of the finest Owls in Diagon   Alley for purchase. I expect it to take no more than fifteen minutes-   and ensure you acquire the other items required for proper care and   ownership. Go!"" He ordered after drawing out the same small red velvet   sack of Galleons and Sickles that Draco had used at Madam Malkins a   month  prior.

Hesitantly Dobby reached up to accept the gold and silver before  sparing  the two boys a quick glance and vanishing far more quietly now  than  before. Harry watched the creature go with a feeling of pity.

""Seeing as we are very nearly upon the train and toward Hogwarts  itself,  I trust that you two may entertain yourselves enough to pass  the  remaining time easily. Before much longer the rest of them will  arrive,  and I unfortunately have a job to perform- your mother shall  convey all  the sympathy and such necessary for the both of us. Good  luck, Draco,  Mister Potter."" Lucius told them simply and rested a hand  on either of  their shoulders for a moment, lingering more upon his own  childs before  disapparating just as quietly as Dobby had managed.

Harry felt heat rushing into his face at the touch and partial-kindness   of the act, and he smiled without realizing it. ""Well, come on then,   Potter, lets find somewhere to duel and make sure we can show the other   brats a thing or two,"" he said confidently, completely at ease now and   not nervous in the slightest about performing even more  technically-illegal magic at that point.

Harry nodded a little bemusedly and trotted after him as Narcissa   conjured a seat all to herself and drew an envelope from her pockets to   peruse again.

A short time later and things began to pick up quickly.

Dobby delivered a  magnificent black eagle-owl whose name was to be  decided by Draco,  along with its gilded golden cage and the finest owl  treats available,  while a slightly less majestic tawny and black dotted  owl looking rather  like a transfigured leopard sat within a paler  white cage for Harry  himself.

""M-masters owls, Ma'am,"" the house elf told Narcissa quietly and set  the  cages down. She barely looked up"
"old obsession. Tom Riddle. Older, changed – with a distinct reptilian aspect which only made him more striking. He hissed tales of death and the existence as a ghost, of what secrets he had uncovered during the years he’d been gone… of how Dumbledore had manipulated him, but was too afraid to let him know too much. He said Harry knew nothing of the true extent of his manipulations.

The low, sensual hisses were tormenting, forever echoing in his head. If Tom Riddle’s sixteen-year-old self had been charismatic, this incarnation of Voldemort was able to weave his words a hundred times better, leaving Harry enraptured with every word as they spilled smoothly from the pale, almost lipless mouth.

They discussed so many things, it was just so easy to talk, forget of all that transpired between them before that Harry often found himself disbelieving that such a charming, intelligent man was a mindless mass murderer without purpose.

 Until the news came that Voldemort had returned… Confused, scared and excited, Harry had to make sure for himself. He threw himself into spying on all of the old Death Eaters, waiting for a chance to tail one of them to a gathering. And there was the Dark Lord, terrifying and cruel as Harry had remembered him, but considerably more sane. Well, Harry’s own standards may have been slipping, but Voldemort seemed much more in control of his emotions and magic than at the height of his second rise to power – in Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts. It felt as though it was a lifetime ago that he watched Cedric Diggory drop lifelessly to the ground and then witness the rebirth of the most powerful Dark Lord of the century.

Voldemort’s eyes seemed to follow him, even under the invisibility cloak. Yet he did nothing, but smirked at Harry, before continuing with the welcoming speech to his minions.

Something strange happened, then. The pain in his scar stopped, vanishing altogether.

The anxiety that was tightening his chest, making it hard to breathe, was replaced with excitement instead. He felt lightheaded and aroused, to the point of his entire body shaking involuntarily. Confused, he fled the old manor, unnoticed by any of the present Death Eaters. He ran straight home, his heart racing.

“Voldemort is back,” was all he could say, his feelings too intense to put into words otherwise. His mind was racing, trying fond find any explanation for the Dark Lord’s return, but unable to make sense of any of it. He reappeared virtually from nowhere, even though almost ten years had passed since Harry had killed Nagini, the last Horcrux and then duelled with Voldemort himself, barely coming out of it alive.

“How?” she choked out, her eyes brimming with barely held back tears. He felt something within him break at the sight of her, unable to move forward to hug and comfort her or say it will all be ok. He didn’t know why he felt so unmoved by her tears or why he didn’t simply tell her he’d seen Voldemort and that he’d suspected he’d been back for months already. His lips formed a thin line, self inflicted silence sealing them firmly. He felt numb and detached under Ginny’s crestfallen gaze, unable to call forth the warm affection he once held for her. So he left, his movements almost mechanical, closing the door behind him to shut out the image of his wife curled up on the bed with tears streaming down her face.

He shut himself away after that, perusing the depths of his mind for answers. Voldemort hovered in his thoughts; in all his dreams and then even every waking moment. He felt haunted, but the Dark Lord’s presence was comforting at times. He revealed to Harry the true extent of Dumbledore’s machinations. He even told Harry how he came to possess a real body once more. The parts of his soul in the Horcrux did not die upon its destruction. It is beyond wizards, even in this day, to eradicate a soul.  Instead, they dissipated, their power lost, but not gone. As long as even one piece of his soul remained living, the others could not leave this world either. He spent a decade as a hopeless ghost, searching for his lost Horcruxes. They were the weak parts of him, parts he wanted to cast out, but he had to welcome them back out of necessity. He merged back with them, slowly regaining the strength to wield his old magic and used an ancient sacrificial ritual to obtain a young, healthy body. It had once belonged to a muggle, but changed upon infusion of his dark powers. With more of his soul back came back the clarity of thinking, his old feelings and memories. He remembered his true purpose behind the hatred of Muggles. None of that mattered to Harry though. Having lived in the wizarding world for almost twenty years, he now truly saw the difference between magic and non-magic human. Muggles treated each other like filth, bred like rabbits and destroyed the very planet they lived on."
"the swish of his third and incomplete spell carried no meaning behind it.

I rolled away from the rush of wind and flame, protected in part by my cloak, letting it pitch my body forward as he banished the desk across the tiled floor. One hand gripped the surface as I flew over and allowed me the strength to grow stable in the chaotic flight and land on my knees roughly, painfully, but not in defeat.

He turned in an instant to finish what his work had started; but too late, that single instant too late, for I had never ceased my motions even through the destruction of each knee.

The rage burning behind his eyes flared higher as my Chaser-honed reflexes tore the wand from his minutely-weaker hands, and in that moment a low pang of regret registered behind my satisfaction of taking up his Hallow.

My weaker wand appeared in the opposite hand as I banished his body backwards into another portrait of long-dead headmasters, finally taking in their shouts and panic as further flame licked up along their walls.

A basic healing charm undid the damage to my legs in a flare of light and a rush of giddiness as Dumbledore pushed up onto one arm, the shame of both his actions and his defeat openly displayed.

""Thank you for the knowledge... and the gift, headmaster."" I told him softly, freezing the fires in place before any more damage could be sown, rationale returning but unaffected by my victory.

With two in my command the power only coursed that much stronger, like a kindling-flame grown wild before a sudden supplement of consumption.

""James... wait..."" he murmured weakly, too slowly.

I vanished his desk and descended the stone stairway before he could even finish my name. I knew there was only one last to be obtained and then the prophecy would no longer matter, that it could not matter were I lord of them each and all.

Lily could feel the changes in me the moment I walked inside our home, the undisguised look of confusionon her face, but it hardly mattered.

I loved her still, of course, that much had not yet been altered; but I knew after listening to Dumbledore's brief history lesson just what would become of that love in due time, just as it had become of his favor toward Grindelwald, of his own brother and sister.

And a part of me I had not known existed, had perhaps not even been before tonight, whispered it's loathing of her softly in my heart. ""James? What happened? What did Albus say to you?"" She asked in concern.

To lie, or not to lie.

I could not let her take in the Hallows as I had, sharing them as I once did my cloak so foolishly in blind youth. And then I heard his cries and that whisper grew silent for a time, as Lily turned with a moment's hesitation to look in on our son.

""I'll tell you later."" Her eyes grew more concerned before exiting the room and I knew then, taking in Harry's whimpers and whines as the sound both soothed the urges and bore a hole within my heart, that he would be the one capable of washing away their stain one moment at a time.

It made the anguish that formed later as he slept quietly all the more powerful.

With only two in my possession I could not stop the prophecy from coming true, I could not keep either of them safe... yet just how much safer would they be beneath Albus' Fidelius charm without the third Hallow clasped in hand? How long would it take before their blood drenched my hands then?

A high pitched voice cast out the first curse quietly, calmly, and the door exploded inward as only so much ash and splinters. His followers crept at an equally quiet pace forward with the occasional note of mirth escaping from behind stark-white masks.

Upstairs Lily paced in silent madness, protected by several wards I had forced Sirius and Remus into casting a week prior, just before my resolve at last folded from the search.

It was as much to keep her away from Voldemort as it was away from me, though more than once I had tested the measures. Only Harry's voice kept them both alive and safe for another night, another hour, until tonight.

Voldemort himself looked for a moment to stall. His features seemed, perhaps, confused at the sight that greeted the glimmering-red eyes. I supposed my own descent must have looked equally familiar if disturbed, hazel eyes long since darkened to black.

The cloak rested over my shoulders and trailed the ground with a wary note of amusement in the way it never stayed still, wavering as if in a wind no one else could feel or hear.

The wand tapped against my left thigh to a beat of its own choosing, reverberating faint echoes of magic in the wake of each.

And the last, the final of the Hallows, the stone-bound-in-ring glinted on my left finger with an inner-chaotic gleam.

The Death Eaters at his back looked in around their master's shoulders and took note of me"
"’s hips as the younger man moaned appreciatively.

 

Dumbledore shook his head, as if trying to shake off the truth, which was hitting him in the face.

 

“Yes, you old fool. You might have discovered him and thrown him in Azkaban and managed to drive me to the brink of death… but we’re so much stronger than that. Seven years is nothing in the face of immortality,” Voldemort showed a shiny ring with a black gem in the middle, adorning the index finger of his left hand. Dumbledore’s eyes widened with horror upon the realization and he finally accepted his defeat. He hadn’t won when he threw Harry in Azkaban those years ago. He had already lost; he just didn’t know it yet.

 

“Now that we are reunited, Harry, my love, would you like to finally have your revenge on the old fool?” Voldemort spoke into Harry’s ear, the corners of his lipless mouth turning up in a twisted smile, which made Dumbledore shiver and struggle against his restraints. Harry purred happily at the close contact with his lover, but freed himself of the arms around him. 

 

“It’s useless, Dumbledore. You will pay for your idiocy tonight,” he said, walking up closer to the man. “You thought you could mould me for your twisted purposes, to be your perfect little weapon. All that accomplished was making me hate Muggles more and more every year you forced me to go back to that filthy place,” Harry leaned in so close that Dumbledore could see his own frightened, old face reflecting in those sparkling green orbs. “Voldemort is the best thing that has happened to me my whole life and since I turned away from you I’ve been happier than ever. Even Azkaban couldn’t break me,” his dirty teeth flashed in a grin. “Though admittedly, it wasn’t all ponies and rainbows. I wonder, have you ever actually been to Azkaban? Have you heard the hoarse screams in the darkest hour of the night as the Dementors suck out the very life from the only human being within close proximity? Then the screams stop and even when the soul has died, the sobbing and shaking of the body doesn’t cease. They sit there lifelessly, staring at you with empty, wide eyes, never moving,” his voice dropped to a mere whisper which for some reason sounded louder than a scream in the heavy silence of the room. “It’s terrifying,” Harry flashed him another insane grin and Dumbledore realized that Azkaban had only made the fearless monster within the young man stronger. He swallowed thickly, knowing he had made a terrible mistake, which would cost him his life.

 

“But enough of the small talk. You will die now. Say hi to Snape and the Dursleys in hell. Tell them that Harry sends his love,” he laughed at the top of his lungs and Voldemort joined in, showing his forked tongue with amusement. It doesn’t last long and Dumbledore knows his time is up.

Slashing his wand through the air in quick motions, Harry cuts the old man’s flesh, creating small patterns of bloody gashes. He giggles at the sigh and turns around to steal a chaste kiss from his lover’s lipless mouth, before turning back to Dumbledore, whose eyes were closed, his face wet with silent tears, his wrinkled hand forming fists as he braced himself against the pain in his whole body. But Harry was far from done. He didn’t spend seven years doing nothing. He had come up with a list of inventive and interesting curses he would cast on the man who had taken away his childhood. He boiled the blood in the man’s veins and burned the nerves in his skin. He twisted bones in and out of the broken body, amused by the cracking sounds of ribs breaking. His magic crackled around him happily as he poured more and more into the spells, breaking, slashing, burning.

 

“He’s dead, Harry,” Voldemort whispers in his ear, snapping Harry’s furious concentration.

 

“Oh…” he says ever-so-eloquently, staring at the mangled corpse in front of him. “I hope his wretched soul burns in hell, if such a place exists,” he says spitefully, not relinquishing the tight hold on his wand.

 

“I thought we’ve already agreed that Muggle beliefs are stupid and pointless,” Voldemort chuckles, circling around his lover predatorily. Harry growls.

 

“And yet I hope he suffers for all eternity and more.”

 

“I understand, he screwed with my life almost as much as he had with yours,” Voldemort steps up close to him, their noses mere centimetres apart. Harry’s breath is shallow and he leans into his lover’s chest, waves of tiredness and pain washing over his whole body. Azkaban hadn’t broken his mind, but it broke his body. He knows he is deathly thin, the joints and bones in his whole body hurt and even breathing involves a lot of effort. He had almost forgotten about it when he got carried away, all his concentration"
"Wildas Haim blinked twice, lifted his hand to massage his temples, and promptly fell over.

After a couple minutes, he regained conciousness, and promptly vomited. A few minutes after that, he had regained his bearings, Vanished the mess he had made, and dusted off his cloak. The Transition always did that to him - not entirely a rare side-effect of the experience, but still one that was rather unfairly linked to the inexperienced and inept. Wildas was neither, and the top brass knew it. That was why he had been specially selected for this mission, which was not just the most dangeous mission he had ever attempted, but quite possibly the most dangerous mission attempted by any wizard in his century. Not only was he traveling back to the First Potter War, not only was this nowhere near his first time doing so, and not only was he going to be within mere feet of a previous version of himself, a couple years and a Hippogriff-load of missions back, but he was going to do so under his real name.

While no one had been tactless enough to explicitly say it out loud, it had been made abundantly clear that this was to be Wildas' last mission in this era, if not his last mission, period. Wildas hadn't balked at this - it was all part of the job, and he knew exactly what he was getting into when he signed up for the Department so many, many years ago. As he stumbled out of the closet in the small empty flat off Knockturn Alley that was always rented out but no one knew exactly to whom, Wildas winced at a small twinge in his knee. It wasn't a big deal, but it was yet another indication that he was slowly approaching the age of ""Too Blasted Old For This"". He stalked over to the mirror in the gloomy hallway and took out his wand. He reflected on how ironic it was that now that he was starting to get to the point that he no longer had to Transfigure his hair into the trademark wiry gray of his now-retired persona, that persona was, well, now-retired. He murmured and fussed, jabbing his face here and there with his wand, until he was satisfied with his work.

A man with cloudy gray eyes, neatly shorn blonde hair, and only a slight hint of wrinkles on his conventionally attractive, but not entirely memorable face, stepped out of a flat onto a sidestreet of Knockturn Alley. He briskly walked past crooning crones and wizened wizards hawking wares of dubious quality and even more dubious intent. He had to move quickly, both metaphorically speaking in regards to the plan, and literally so, because something about the smell of Knockturn Alley always got to him. It wasn't strong enough to be categorized as a stench, but there was definitely a smell to that place that was markedly different than that of Diagon Alley, and it was not one that Wildas Haim liked, thank you very much. Besides, while newbies to the side of the Dark Arts always thought it a clever idea to start looking for leads in the place nationally recognized for being a home of illict wizardry, Wildas knew you had to look elsewhere if you wanted real connections. Of course, anyone with any real brains knew that the Ministry of Magic was implicit in the continuining existence and allure of Knockturn Alley, favoring the devil they knew and got bribes from over the one they didn't. 

The warm spring air lifted Wildas' spirits as he stepped onto Diagon Alley and began to head for the passage to Muggle London. It was May 1997, Dumbledore was still alive, Scrimgeour was still growling about the Minister's office, and Ministry had not yet fallen. Those lowest in the pecking order of his organization (but still high enough to know of his mission's existence) knew that his mission was to make sure that the fall of the Ministry happened differently. Those at the top of the pecking order knew that his true mission was to make sure that it didn't fall at all. But only Wildas and the Council of Five (who were so far up on that pecking order that almost no one below them even knew they existed) knew that his true, true mission was indeed to make sure that the Ministry fall happened differently, but in a way no one would ever expect, or be prepared for.

Wildas Haim was no longer going to change history. He was going to make it."
"of time which he spent being a lazy slob he had always been. She probably had to do everything around the house as well as actually looking after the children.

 

He spotted Ginny in the crowd as well. She looked to be holding up a lot better than his other two friends. Being a very intelligent and much more bearable version of Ron, she was working as an Auror. The Auror office had ceased hunting all Dark wizards and was now used as a force to fight crime in general. It had been a very stupid misconception that only Dark wizard and Slytherins committed crimes and Harry was very glad to see it gone and the society put on the right path once again. Ginny seemed to be accompanying Luna Lovegood, who was wearing a big necklace made from walnuts, but otherwise seemed a lot more grounded to reality than he had last seen her. A small smile tugged at the corners of his lips – he had always liked the blonde Ravenclaw, who had accepted him even when she knew he was working with Voldemort. She didn’t support either side in the war and went by mainly ignoring politics. Seeing her with Ginny – he had guessed that they had returned to their relationship from school years. They had been going out for some time at Hogwarts, but then Ginny dated some boys for a few years, but never seriously. He was glad for the two of them to have a happy relationship. He didn’t have anything against Ginny or Luna and would gladly leave them alone, unless they interfered. 


 


He saw many more of his old acquaintances, friends and enemies, mingling and making small talk politely. He didn’t care about any of them though, so he wasn’t about to seek them out. Instead he sought out his lover, finding himself immensely bored.  Political parties weren’t really his thing. They were Voldemort’s thing. He danced among politicians with appealing words, wrapping them all around his little finger without them even knowing they had been manipulated. He made it look like child’s play.

 

He was speaking with some plain-looking but very old wizard with merely patches of gray hair when Harry approached him and gently nudged his elbow with his hand, standing close to whisper, “Let’s stir things up a bit.” Voldemort caught on instantly, even if he didn’t know what Harry had planned for the night.

 

“Mr. Ogden, allow me to introduce to you my partner, Harry Potter,” Voldemort said with pretence of politeness, but his eyes told a different story, looking smug and full of cruel amusement. It took Harry a moment to recall where he had heard the man’s name before…ah! He was one of Dumbledore’s oldest friends and supporters. His lips curled up into a smirk at the look of betrayal, shock and hurt in the old wizard’s eyes.

 

Mr. Ogden gasped, his eyes widening almost comically and he stood there, gaping at the two wizards in dumbfounded silence.

 

“Harry Potter… impossible!” he finally managed to get out, his shocked expression replaced by anger. Witches and wizards around them fell silent suddenly, everyone’s eyes snapping to the young wizard by their Minister’s side.

 

Harry grinned mischievously, moving his hair to the side to reveal the lighting bolt scar on his forehead.

 

“Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,” he drawled, letting his hair fall back down loosely.

 

“Harry Potter?!” a yell was heard from somewhere deep in the crowd and a few seconds later Ron and Hermione had emerged into the small empty space that had formed around Voldemort and Harry. The redhead still had crumbs all over his face.

 

Harry rolled his eyes. “Are you that shocked to see me? I’d thought that by now you would have learned that the Boy-Who-Lived simply doesn’t disappear and die.”

 

Hermione looked bewildered, while Ron went completely red with rage on his face, looking like a dried up tomato.

 

“You filthy traitor!” he bellowed at Harry, whipping out his wand without thinking. Too bad for him that the Ministry had been mostly converted to Voldemort’s followers, either out of fear or being smart enough to see that things really had improved since the Ministry had been rebuilt. Before Ron could even cast a spell, a dozen Aurors in the crowd had their wands trained on him, Ginny included. The man sent his sister a look of utmost betrayal, but she didn’t even bat an eyelash at the insults he shouted at her. Hermione had taken out her wand too, looking rather desperate, trying to shield her useless husband a bit. It wasn’t the cleverest thing to do, Harry mused. She could have got away unharmed, but it was too late now that she had pointed her wand at him.

 

“You’re under arrest for attempted assault on the Minister and Harry Potter,” one of the Aurors said. It was a tough-looking man who Harry recognised as one of Voldemort’s supporters.

 

Hermione and Ron moved to resist, but the Aurors were trained to capture people. In the blink of"
"the smug bastard. He's been so...

“Infuriating,” Tom breathes, leaning closer to him.

“Exactly,” Harry agrees and gets up quickly, not sure if he can keep from doing something tremendously stupid himself.  “There's something I've been meaning to ask you, actually.”

Tom's annoyance seems to take a backseat for a moment and he waits a moment for Harry to speak.

“Where do you see me in five, ten years?” he asks calmly and the calculating look which used to be ever present in his eyes is back again. “You don't... need to answer that. I honestly don't think you'd even thought that far ahead, other than about what the world will be like with you on top. Maybe you vaguely expected me to follow you wherever you would go. I don't think I can do that, Tom. You manipulated me under your thumb back at school. I didn't have any goals in life, I didn't have anything that could keep my interest... and you exploited that to suit yourself. You almost made me forget that I don't have to go along with everything you do. I've recently realized that what I want...” 

Harry pauses for a moment and his hand travels to his robe pocket to take out the ring that he'd kept since he stole it from the Charms professor all those years ago. Tom's ring.

“...Doesn't matter,” he mutters and places the ring on the table and withdraws a little. “I hope you find what you're looking when you're king of the world.” He cracks a smile and leaves quickly, not looking back at Tom's no doubt dumbfounded face.

 *

He tries to feign indifference to the Death Eater's movements, staying locked up in the Potter-Black manor to work on his book on using martial arts and magic for self defence and duelling. The research is going slowly and he feels like the walls are slowly closing in around his desk, urging him to get out there and do something. It's an altogether unfamiliar feeling. Before Tom, before he got swept off his feet by the attention the genius wizard paid him, he never used to feel anything so acutely. Nothing seemed to matter in the long run, so he'd rarely developed interest in anyone, either. But then he'd picked up the trail of the rising Dark Lord and suddenly his world began to spin at full speed. The obsession quickly overshadowed everything else and he'd forgotten how to be himself, merely following along with Tom's ambitions. Being so young and impressionable, he completely fell for the impressive and compelling Dark Lord.

He doesn’t want to be just another follower. Even if he has some privileges, even if Tom occasionally lets his guard down around him, it’s not enough anymore. Is it really so bad, to want to stand by Tom's side as an equal? He doesn’t want to be recognised only for the kill count on raids and for being good in bed. He once had thought that Tom understood and that he wanted him too... before it slowly, surely became obvious that it had all just been a mind game, a challenge to overcome. So it’s better to leave, to forget and sit this one out quietly, not picking sides. 

All that was easier said than done, considering he had used his dad's Invisibility Cloak to sneak into the ministry and killed Crabbe to save Tom's ass. He could only pretend to be impartial, when really; he'd been on Tom's side all along, intentionally or not.

Finally, Hermione is the one who manages to drag him outside. They meet at their regular coffee shop in Muggle London and Harry really wishes he'd stayed at home. Refusing in the first place would have been easier, even though he prefers to avoid confrontation of any sort. So much for keeping to himself and out of emotional drama, he thinks sarcastically. First Tom, now Hermione wants something. He just knows she's onto something, there's that little spark in her eyes like there always had been each time she had learned something new at school. Why she hadn't left him be after graduation, he has no idea, but clearly, she had assumed they became friends at some point and now continues to self-appointedly 'look out for him'. Her insistent prying into his private life really isn't welcome right now.

“Hello Harry,” she says by way of usual greeting, but the feeling... somehow isn’t in it. She sits down opposite him, pulling one of the two steaming drinks towards her.

“Hi,” he returns also less than enthusiastically.

“There's something I need to talk to you about,” she pushes straight to the subject, as bossy as ever. No wonder she never had any real friends all the way through school.

“Have you finally got funding for your muggleborn tracking"
"or even worse, accept them) – and you’d follow.

You’ll follow him into death if need be.

Tom Riddle, you think, sounding out the name in your head.

He glances at you, pinning you with his gaze, and you freeze in your seat.

He smiles slightly, still staring directly at you, before looking away and continuing to speak, though you don’t hear what he’s saying.

You don’t need to.

 


II.


Tom Riddle.

 He fucks you the same way he speaks, the way he does everything.  It’s torturously slow, almost clinical, but underscored by a raging heat that dominates and sets your nerves on fire.

“Tom,” you gasp out when you come, and you’re so dazed that you barely feel him freeze inside of you.

Later, as you’re running fingers over his pale skin, he says quietly, “’Tom’ was my father’s name.  A common, disgusting Muggle name.”

Muggle?  “You’re a half-blood?” and it’s so hard to conceal your tone of disgust, but you think you manage.  It’s impossible, that this man, teeming with power and nobility, could ever be so base.

In one fluid movement, he’s hovering over you, hands to your neck; you choke, gasping desperately for air.

“I might look like him,” he hisses coldly (but his rage is burning and it’s so deliciously painful, you can’t help but want more of it), “but I am Salazar’s heir.  Don’t forget it.”

 


III.



Voldemort.



Lord Voldemort.


Death has never frightened you, but he is your Lord (your master your lover) so you don’t tell him that you preferred the name Tom.

Tom is a lover’s name, Voldemort a master’s.

He still fucks you, but doesn’t stay afterwards; he doesn’t linger in bed, doesn’t let you touch his skin (that’s getting paler and paler even as his eyes lose their incongruous soft brown to what looks disconcertingly like the colour of Gryffindor rubies).

But he still spends time with you, still smiles approvingly when you come up with a new idea to convert the stupid sheep that make up the Wizarding world.

Anything for that.

 


IV.


You don’t start off finding happiness in suffering.  Oh, Andromeda (blood traitor whore but always a Black, always your sister) and Cissy might talk about you killing animals; but never for the pain.  You’re curious – how much blood lost before it’s too much, what the inside of a cat looks like.

They didn’t understand, but your Lord does; he recognises where your talents lie, gives you purpose where nothing else has.  He’s your guiding light, through obsequious Ministry officials wanting nothing more than to be seen with you to raise their miserable social statuses.

 


V.


You don’t find happiness in suffering but you laugh when the Longbottoms scream.  You wish their son was here, their little newborn baby that’s off with his grandmother (not that you’re worrying about that, because the next miserable life on your list is Augusta Longbottom).  You want to tear them apart then put them back together, want to find a way to make sure they die over and over till he comes back and then you’ll kill all these blood traitors together, you and him.

 


VI.


Azkaban makes you crazy, perhaps.

But you’ve been insane since you met him.

And that will never change, you vow, as Dementors steal everything from you that made you want to live (everything but him, nothing can take that, and so when you’re rocking backwards and forwards on your pile of straw, you don’t think about your sisters what sisters only him)

Only him.

 


VII.


It’s the happiest day of your life when you realise you’re going to see him again.


And then you do.


He’s not who (what) you remember (no fire just ice, cold and harsh and unforgiving and he was all of those but so much more and you can’t bring yourself to think that-)

But you’re not what you remember, either.

 


VIII.


Bella.  He still calls you Bella, even if his voice is cold and affectionless, even if he doesn’t smile at you like he used to, even if he doesn’t order you to join him in bed.  He trusts you, even if he doesn’t love you (never loved you), even if he doesn’t want you.

Azkaban has ruined you for him, but nothing can ruin him for you.


Only him.


 


IX.


Your spirit lingers, resisting Death’s call and the choice you have to make.  You see his anger when you fall and something in you smiles. 

When Potter strikes him down, when his body falls broken to the ground, you wait.

Nothing rises from the"
"leading him to the one he wished to find.

A shimmering purple dress, blond hair… it had to be Luna Lovegood. Why did he have to dance with her, of all people? Although he had to admit, it was very much like him to choose someone unpopular and a bit odd as a partner. Half to avoid suspicion, half because he felt she was a kindred soul or something like that. Yes, he always liked to say such nonsense.

His deep green and gold mask was glistening in the low light, hiding his scar and his beautiful green eyes. Most of his face was hidden – Tom had made sure of that when he had it custom made – but he would never mistake another for him. Even if he had not known every inch of his lover’s face so well it vividly haunted his vision day and night, the small bite marks just under his collar were a complete giveaway.

The couple in front of him was spinning around slowly, not dancing too closely like some of the others around them. It was obvious they were not flirting or even remotely attracted to each other as anything more than friends. Then why did he feel such a powerful wave of jealousy? He wanted to twist her pale little arms until they snapped. He wanted to pull out all of her hair. Burn that shimmering dress. Why did he have to be surrounded by so many teachers and students, unable to act at once?

This simply would not do. Not at all.


Lord Voldemort does not share. 


 

*

 

Luna smiled at Harry.

“It was lovely of you to ask me to the party, Harry,” she said dreamily, twirling around in his arms to the music. Her face was hidden behind a yellow and sparkly mask, but behind it, her eyes were staring at him, wide open. He always felt like she could see right through him.

“It’s my pleasure,” he replied politely, letting the corner of his lip lift up slightly. “I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.”

They danced somewhat awkwardly for a bit, never getting too close to each other. Before the song even finished, Luna was pulled away for the next dance by a tall, somewhat bulky boy with a pale grey mask.

Harry’s stomach seemed to flip and clench dangerously when he realised that it was most likely Nott, an older Slytherin and one of his followers. They made the strangest couple ever, Luna dressed in a bright dress and walking with a skip in her step and Nott, stiffly following her lead with hunched shoulders as though he’d rather be anywhere else on the planet.

He wasn’t given time to go rescue Nott from his overly enthusiastic companion, when a pair of strong arms wrapped themselves around him from behind.

“Hello,” said a deep, soothing voice right in his ear. “Dance with me?”

Harry did not immediately turn around. He allowed himself to be pulled closer, feeling the soothing touch of his Horcrux in the ring hidden underneath his captor’s gloves. His familiar scent enveloped Harry and he smiled, finally turning around to face the man behind him.

His gaze fell upon the smooth, perfect lips of his lover which he had senselessly kissed in abandon all too long ago, during a few stolen moments in a broom cupboard. His body reacted to his lascivious thoughts accordingly and he pressed himself even closer to him, burying his face in the man’s loose black cloak.

“Tom,” he whispered, his voice trembling with need and grabbing onto his waist firmly. He heard his lover chuckle pleasantly.

“Missed me?”  the Slytherin almost purred, letting his hands travel down Harry’s body and place themselves in the pockets of his trousers.

“Shut up!” he retorted in frustration. They never had the time to sneak out to meet anymore, not since Tom had made Head Boy at the start of the school year. Once every two weeks really wasn’t enough.

“Shh, love,” Tom whispered. “We can’t be recognised, remember?”

“I know,” Harry scowled into the dark material, but he knew his lover could tell anyway. He always did, somehow. Maybe it was another side effect of the scar he’d given Harry two years prior, when he stumbled into the girl’s bathroom on the second floor by accident. Tom tried to kill him, but the curse rebounded, seriously hurting them both. Harry was left with an odd, lightning shaped scar which seemed to act up whenever Tom was feeling extreme emotions. He also started to be able to speak Parseltongue and afterwards, Riddle trailed after him all the time to make sure he wouldn’t spill to any teachers about what he was doing and that he had tried to kill Harry. They had somehow fallen in love after that, initially driven by lust for each other, which then turned into something deeper when Tom came to save him from his abusive muggle uncle.

“Dance with me?” his lover asked, pulling Harry along as he moved to the slow music. It didn’t take long for the"
"still wearing a cool smile. He turned it on the adder in his hand.

“ That’s quite enough, Blackscale.”

XXX 

“You- you speak parseltongue, Professor?”

“I do. Something I picked up in my travels. It has its uses, as I’m sure you can attest.”

Quirrel passed Blackscale back to her. Harry took him with numb hands, returning him to around her neck. Blackscale no longer hung limply; he was coiled now, attentive to the wizard in the room.

“Now, Harry, how would you like to summon snakes as well? It normally picks the closest living serpent, but with a bit of practice, you’ll be able to leave your familiar alone.”

It was a tempting proposal. But it wasn’t really a choice was it?

Not because this was detention, but because Quirrel’s smile was plastic and fake, and she couldn’t forget the way his magic had enveloped her before.

Harry nodded slowly. “Alright, sir.”

XXX 

“Hold your wand a bit higher. The motion is- close. Right there. An S-shape. Childish, I know, but it was designed to be idiot-proof. Do that five times or so. Until you’ve got the feel for it.”

Quirrel circled her. He was walking and talking once again, but it was all around her this time. Every time he moved, passing out of her sight, Harry tightened up. It was involuntary. Tensing for a blow that had yet to come.

“Long curve at the top of the S. Better. Start over. Now, focus. The intent is the important part. The wand motion is just window dressing.”

Harry looked up, eyes wide, her terror momentarily broken. “I’d been wondering that.”

“Most wizards are simply too incompetent for anything more than the very basics.” Quirrel’s eyes glittered, catching the torchlight as he turned to speak to her. “All that truly matters is intent and power. That is why magic is the purest strength there is.”

A pause.

“Cast now. Show me your strength.”

When she moved, it was not for him. Quirrel was right- magic was strength, but her magic was hers. Not his. Not the Dursleys. Not all the people who adored her for something her wasn’t.

Letting him have that would be handing over the one thing that was truly hers in this world.


No.


Harry drew the sign in the air, using her wand like a conductor’s baton. Her magic welled up within, surging like white fire, hot enough she thought her breath would ripple in the air, and vast enough there was a sudden flash of fear- a mortal body couldn’t hold this in.

She needed a snake. A snake that wasn’t Blackscale. The snake needed to be here. Right here. Right now. Right now. She needed. She WANTED. 


 “Serpensortia!”


XXX

A tiny, green grass snake wound between her fingers, tongue flicking out to kiss her fingertips.

Quirrel held out his hand for it. Harry hesitated for a moment before letting the serpent slide from her palm to his.

“Most children wouldn’t be able to cast that so quickly.”

“Is she going to be okay?” Harry asked, indicating the grass snake.

Quirrel raised an eyebrow. “I will return her to where she came from. The spell for that is, oddly enough, more advanced.”

“Oh.”

He snapped his fingers and with a pop, the grass snake vanished. “Would you like to learn it?”

She went still.

This had been detention. She’d had to be here. But any more would be on her own.

With him.

Quirrel was still an unknown quantity. He went out of his way to teach her an incredible spell, but also did things with his magic, and the way his personality had shifted was downright eerie.

She knew nothing about him, and he seemed to know everything about her.

He was a parselmouth too- and wasn’t that supposed to be really rare? And genetic, not learned? Padma had said that. She needed to talk to Blackscale about this.

“Why? Why- all of this?” she said, surprising herself with her sudden directness.

For the first time, something genuine crept into his smile. “I enjoy teaching. And you seem to be a more apt pupil than most of your peers.” Quirrel turned and began walking to his desk. “If you have misgivings, feel free to think on them. If you would like to return… I have office hours every day from three to six.”

He shuffled through a few of the pages before looking up at her. “You may leave at any time.”

“Oh. Ah- goodnight, Professor.”

Harry grabbed her bag, pocketed her wand, and made for the door.

“Miss Riddle.”

His voice stopped her with her hand on the knob.

“You wear the name well.”

Time rolled onward."
"shoulder, he brought it back down with a snarl that exposed yellowed-and-brown canines within nearly lip-less maws, and more than one visualized the enemy that was responsible for their Head's choice - or their own downfall and eventual capture.

For generations, after all, the Nest of Peruvian Viperteeth had played host to the leaders of failed uprisings, whole Clans' kin that had been conquered, or ignoble and untrustworthy members of their society on an individual basis.

Stationed beneath the illustrious eye of Gringotts Bank, they toiled and tolled away for the life of their loan to the Nest, and in return for keeping their undesirable brethren from rampaging through the world, a simple charge of interest was applied on behalf of the Clans' involved - the delivery of worthy titles, deeds to lands desired, and old smith-work long overdue all given over to the Bank's holding.

For many and for the better part of the centuries since its implementation, it was a trade well-viewed by their society.

But for many more into the recent times, it had been a constant Devil's Snare in their ancestral vaults, dragging more and more luxuries away from the victors of each successive uprising.

Only thrice had the goblin society failed to uphold their payments, and only thrice in the history of the Nest had the inhabitants been rallied toward war as a result.

While wizard-kind saw only further goblin anarchy and inter-racial wars, the Nest reminded the rest of their people of why it existed, and why they - and the Bank - would not be ignored.

No one beneath the ground or tending to the affairs of wizards above it would ever breath a word of the Nest's existence to the other races until equality was finally met, and magic shared in equal measure at last.

The pounding that tedious night ceased immediately within three tiers as it was overpowered by a shrill whistle, and from the yawning vertical gap down the middle of the passageways, the Feeder slid down on an ancient chain reenforced with runes.

""Dinnertime, you heaping cur's! Sit down and open up!"" his voice echoed up and down each row as he spun in place, and he produced an Ever-Contracting Spear from a pouch belted to his waist.

The copper tool glistened with a rudimentary shish kabob along its length, scraps of muscle, marrow, and a white-gray goo that was meant to aide in swallowing.

The mass of food was proven to be considerably thinner than it had at first appeared after the spear performed its function, however, shooting forward and pinning the slanted point into the eastern wall firmly.

Despite being reduced to at-most three bites per goblin, they still fell upon it like a murder of taunted crows. Fingers pinched and pulled and scraped at it, eroded incisors bit hard into the cool metal beneath, and with those who actually had proper strength available, a new set of scratches marred the surface of the haft when they were done.

The Feeder shook his end after mere seconds, dislodging any last-gnawers, and the tool retracted back into a more manageable length as he turned about and dipped it into the pouch to repeat the process for the other three rows around him.

The last slave at the far end of the eastern row, still licking his chops irritably, fingered the pickaxe's point as he eyed the Feeder.

His tendons itched to leap and drive a blow that would kill the employee, to take into his own hands a weapon once again and then press its lovely tip straight into the magical eye spiraling around within the Watcher's skull when he descended like the carrion-spit he was to survey them again.

He longed for the time now far past when he had heralded fresh blood spilt out of the enemies throat across virgin soil, and taken first pick of the spoils of war thereafter.

It was a thought commonly shared by the others in the nearby tiers. And like those others, he swallowed his bloodlust with a final lap of his pitted tongue across the stubs of his teeth, scraping up the very last drop of goop clinging to the gums.

Once the Feeder dropped down and out of sight only seconds later, another rusted chain appeared as the Watcher descended from above.

Whereas the Feeder was merely ugly in the traditional sense, with the blood of a house elf only two sires back, he at least had the grace to cover up his oddities behind a cowl and veil.

The Watcher did not.

Smoother, human-tainted ears, an softer nose, and that despicable wizard-crafted blue eye rushing about in every direction were all displayed, and it was boasted of loudly and often that the cat o' nine tails strapped to its' precious belt contained the remnants of a broken wand inside of the device.

Gray hair hung from the ears and met around the back of the head to keep it well away from the eyes, and the brown-red of the remaining natural pupil stared defiantly down each row as he examined them for hints of mutiny.

He couldn't even deign to wear natural goblin-crafted clothing or armor, foregoing it in favor"
"all, Albus, I need to prepare classes fo-“

“Oh,” he says with wide eyes, “You thought- no, no, it’s my fault, I’m terribly sorry.”  Albus exhales heavily, as though the weight of the world is on his shoulders.  Minerva for one is almost positive it can’t compare to having the weight of a fifteen year old’s body around one’s shoulders. 

(In a manner of speaking.)

She takes the bait anyway, certain as she is that she’s not going to like the answer.  “What do you mean?”

He sighs.

Again.

“I can’t have my students taught by a fifteen year old girl, Minerva,” Albus tells her with a shake of his head.  “That would be irresponsible.”

“Even for you?” Minerva mutters with a sinking heart, thinking back to possessed turban-wearing weaklings, award-winning smilers, werewolves and crazy prison escapees.

(Lupin, Minerva acknowledges, was less a werewolf and more a cuddly teddy bear with a dark side of teeth and blood.  But still.)

“Yes, Minerva,” he says sharply with a hint of annoyance, “even, as you say, for me.”

“Well sh- wonderful – what am I expected to do, then?”

“Take a holiday, perhaps?  Unless…”

She doesn’t like the sound of that but steels herself.

“Unless…?”

She’s right, as it turns out.

 

~

 

This is so, so stupid, she thinks to herself as she signs the ridiculous and quite possibly illegal signup sheet for Potter and minions’ latest suicide attempt, trying not to admire the admittedly awe- spectacular Charms work that has gone into the whole thing.

 “Don’t you think it’s rather odd that there’s a transfer student?  And since when was there another wizarding school – that we haven’t even heard of – in Britain?” Granger says in a rather failed attempt of a hushed whisper to Weasley and Potter.  Minerva refuses to acknowledge that it is possibly evidence of the psychological impact of the potion that she finds Granger’s words annoying and obnoxious rather than insightful, and the fact that Granger is…

Never mind.

As Minerva watches out of the corner of her eye, Potter shrugs.  “Give her a chance, ‘Mione.  She’s been sorted into Gryffindor, she can’t be that bad,” he says patiently (obviously, if he has to deal with Granger with her bushy hair and regrettably straight teeth and Minerva really has no idea why all the guys seem to think she’s that-)

She winces, resists the urge to clutch too obviously at her head.

“Here, Mi- Hermione, wasn’t it?” Minerva says loudly, smiling at Potter as she shoves the piece of paper back at Granger.

It’s a grateful smile, she insists to herself, and she absolutely isn’t resisting the urge to bat her eyelashes at him like she hasn’t done since that bastard Riddle back in sixth year.

“Alright, everyone, today we’re going to be covering…”

Minerva is far too preoccupied with trying to remind herself that she’s past menopause, not sixteen, to actually listen to whatever it is that Harr- Potter is telling the students.

 

~

 

Even though it took Minerva all of about five minutes to determine the exact nature of Harry’s (Potter, he is still your student, Potter) suicide attempt for the year, she still finds herself going to those ridiculous meetings (and really, Dumbledore’s Army?  As though the man actually needs an army) and mouthing spells that she’d mastered by third year. 

She finds herself forced to admit sometimes that perhaps Albus was a little remiss in actually providing the students with competent teachers.

(Just a little.)

(Maybe.)

(And there is absolutely nothing appealing about the way Harry (goddamnit) frowns when he’s duelling.)

(And she’s definitely not sinking into the pits of adolescent mentality.)

 

~

 

Alright, perhaps she is.  But Harry’s got the most gorgeous green eyes – even Hermione thinks so, when she’s not too busy mooning after that moron Weasley – and honestly, she’s sixteen, she deserves to give herself a break.

(And she is really careful to ignore that frustrating little voice in the back of her head that keeps insisting that she’s more sixty than sixteen and should really not have gotten drunk – something about arteries, and their apparent importance – and made out with Ginny Weasley for five Sickles when classes finished for the Christmas holidays.)

 

~

 

Christmas is the best time of her life because that’s when it happens.

“Hey Minnie, um.” 

Harry shuffles from foot to foot as, wand still raised after barely remembering to actually speak the spell when she knocks out Ginny, Minerva looks up at him from under her eyelashes. She’s very careful not to bat them (yet) as she answers, “yes?  Is something wrong with my technique?” Eyelashes, flutter, now!"
". Identical boys froze, looking for the source of the noise. When they found you in the gloom, there was even less movement. You eyed the one on the ground, George, critically. Whatever he was carrying was heavy... ""Is that for Charlie?""

George nodded slowly, thinking fast on how to talk his way out of being caught in the middle of a prank.

""Yeah, yeah, that's it! It's for Charlie!"" the one in the window, Fred, replied.

You smiled good-naturedly. ""Let me help you."" They nodded as you pulled out your wand and levitated the sack up and through the window.

""Excellent. Thanks!"" George grinned at you before taking off to a door that would permit him to enter the Burrow. Fred pulled up the rope and waved down at you. ""Have a good night!""

You waved back and leaned on the side of the house again. What nice brothers Charlie had, bringing his stuff to him. Although... as you thought about it, Charlie hadn't brought a sack like that with him... And why would it matter if he woke up...? You looked up at the closed window. What were the twins really doing up there?""



~*~

""Love the hair Charlie!"" one twin cackled.

Charlie pulled the strands into his line of sight and a vein throbbed in his temple. Nobody messed with Charlie Weasley's hair and got away with it. Not fire-breathing dragons and certainly not two younger brothers. He gritted his teeth and turned to the pair, ready to explode. Sensing the imminent danger, you piped in, ""It looks good.""

He turned to you and sighed. ""This is why I tend to avoid my family."" He shot the twins another glare before pulling out his wand.

""I wouldn't do that if I were you,"" the other twin snickered.

""Oh? Watch me,"" Charlie growled, touching the wand tip to his green hair.

With a large cloud of green smoke, Charlie's hair turned bright blue and grew another foot in length. Your mouth fell open as the twins burst into laughter. You were so out of there.



~*~

Confrontations were not your thing. Thus, even when you saw one of the twins heading out, broomstick in one hand, sack in the other, you didn't call out and confront him about what had happened. Charlie, however, had no such qualms. He opened the window and yelled at the twin. ""You'd better not come back any time soon George! When I catch you, you're as dead as Fred!"" He looked down at the top of your head. ""Same with you (Name). I can't believe you'd be so childish!"" You cringed as he slammed the window shut.

Now what were you going to do? Charlie had promised to take you sightseeing, but since he was mad at you, there was no way he would want to take you anywhere.

""(Name)!"" the twin Charlie had been yelling at called. You looked up in surprise. ""Want to come with?""

You nodded frantically; anything to get away from a miffed Charlie. When you caught up to him, he turned and led you towards an orchard in the distance.

""George, right?"" you asked tentatively. You were horrible with names and faces to begin with, so twins were always a nightmare.

He grinned at you. ""Correct.""

You offered a small smile in return. ""Where are we going?""

George tossed a bag to you. ""To practice Quidditch.""

""Where's your brother?""

""From the sounds of it, Charlie got him,"" George mused thoughtfully.

""Shouldn't you go help him?""

He laughed. ""And miss the chance to have the broom all to myself? Naw. He can handle big, bad Charlie by himself.""

You nodded absently as you slung the bag over one shoulder and continued to try and match pace with George. He was taller than you by a good six inches, so naturally his stride was longer.

""So you work with dragons?""

""Yes. The hatchlings.""

""It's hard to believe. You don't have any scars.""

It was your turn to laugh. ""Only careless people like Charlie receive scars. If a person pays attention all the time, there's nothing to worry about.""

""Huh.""

George set down the other bag he was carrying once the two of you had reached the middle of the orchard. He continued to hold the broom as he motioned for you to set down the bag he'd given you. ""You fly at all?""

You shook your head. ""I've only ever flown on dragons.""

""Want me to teach you?"" he asked, proffering the broom handle.

""I thought you needed to practice?""

George shrugged. ""Suit yourself."" Quickly and efficiently (with no long, complicated sentences you might have difficulty understanding), George explained what exactly he wanted you to do with the sack of balls on the"
"capable of scoring the same as him if not occasionally higher. He’d tried to talk to Potter a number of times, even to get a rise out of him to get him into trouble, but nothing seemed to phase the young prodigy. He usually just shrugged him off an vanished out of sight. He didn’t seem interested in much of anything, which puzzled the ever-ambitious Slytherin.

“Alright, what proof do you have?” Riddle risked asking, leaning over slightly, eyes narrowed and suspicious.

“I've stored away memories of your conversations around the school. Notes you’ve passed on to your…Knights,” Potter chuckled a little at that, making Riddle scoff. He’d known the name would have to go eventually, but it wasn’t that bad, was it? “I have a few confessions of coercion and blackmail from students too.”

The boy seemed calm, not at all like was accusing him. More like stating a fact, but it really only annoyed Riddle more. How could he be so casual about this? The Slytherin’s entire career and life were on the line here.

“Impossible,” he sneered. It was a bluff, but a good one. He had been careful.

“You’re not as subtle as you think,” Potter said as though he’d anticipated Riddle’s reaction in advance. “I’m curious though. Do you put yourself at risk on purpose?” He titled his messy mop of a head to the side, eyes wide and seemingly innocent.

Riddle’s jaw clenched almost painfully.

“Of course not,” he bit out, growing quickly impatient with this conversation. His wand was just in his sleeve…

“Don’t.” Potter warned, his eyes narrowing just a little. Riddle wasn’t buying his innocent, quiet façade any longer. The kid was smart, observant and sneaky. Why he wasn’t in Slytherin was beyond him. He can’t have tricked the Sorting Hat…? He had underestimated Potter though. He’d let his guard down, thinking he’d had everyone in the school figured out. He’d been careful around the teachers, knowing he couldn’t control them – well, other than Slughorn, the old fool.  “I have taken certain measures to ensure to my safety while I speak to you. If you try anything, the Ministry will know.”

“I see.” Riddle furrowed his brows in concentration, focusing all his brainpower to get a read on Potter. The boy was smart, he’d begrudgingly admit, but he was smarter. “So, you want to turn me in?” He decided to go in for the attack. As good a move as any other at this point.

“I might,” Potter sounded genuinely contemplative for a moment. “I’ll admit, I first set out to catch the rising Dark Lord purely for my own gain,” he admitted without a hint of hesitation, it almost shocked Riddle how easily he admitted to it. “But then I became curious. You’re quite brilliant, you know.” Potter’s burning gaze was unwaveringly studying him for any weakness; Riddle could feel it crawling all over his skin.

“I know,” he nodded with a cocky grin. “But you’re not bad, yourself.” Riddle didn’t really know what had possessed him to switch tactics so suddenly. He felt suddenly uncomfortable under the green eyes’ scrutiny. Potter’s unexpected assault on his position was a welcome intellectual challenge, but the close proximity and the quiet staring were…

“Unnerving,” Potter said suddenly, startling Riddle again. He checked his Occlumency shields quickly, fearing that the brat was reading his mind. “How easily obsessed I get with things that catch my interest,” he continued almost casually. Riddle exhaled shakily, this wasn’t going at all how he’d liked it to. Then the boy picked something out of his pocket. A ring, with carvings in it. Rune carvings. It was his Charms project from the previous year!

“I stole it from the professor before the summer holiday,” Potter shrugged, twirling the little thing in-between his fingers. “It’s quite ingenious. I’d never would have thought to charm it to return to the owner’s pocket the next day, should it ever get lost or stolen.”

“I’m sure you’d have figured out something equally interesting,” Riddle replied somewhat tersely, not intending to make it a compliment, even though it certainly was one. Potter’s lips quirked upwards a little.

“What are you trying to achieve, Riddle?” he asked in that calm tone again, but his eyes sparkled with curiosity.

“Haven’t you figured it out by now?” The Slytherin heir smirked mirthlessly, still tempted to hex the boy into oblivion.

“Of course I have. Every ‘Dark Lord’ wants the same thing, though they use different means to achieve it. I’d like to hear it from you, though.” Potter’s head was"
"be gone, and the softer, less offending light of the moon would illuminate the night. He was not, however, looking forward to entering the restaurant, because it was a Friday night in the summer, which meant a large amount of merry chatter. Hopefully one of his friends had made the dinner reservation and remembered to select a table outside where it wasn't quite so suffocating.

            You watched him apprehensively when the lock to your door didn't open. He made no move to get out of the car while he examined the parking lot closely to make sure that his friends' cars were indeed there, and it hadn't just been Mae and Sarah weaving silly little technology spells. After spotting all three cars, Corentin relaxed a little and unlocked his door.

 

            The car was a piece of shit for sure, you decided. No matter what you did, the door did not unlock. Heat rose to your cheeks in embarrassment as Corentin unlocked his door and exited with ease. So much for trying not to look like an idiot in front of him.

 

            Corentin smiled again as you became more frantic in your attempts at opening the door. He should have told you that it could only be unlocked with the key from the outside, even though it automatically locked when the car started, but he was enjoying the mounting fear and embarrassment that was beginning to roll off of you as you fidgeted with the lock while sitting in his car.

            You looked up at him when he stopped in front of the passenger door and inserted the key. The lock clicked and you nearly knocked him over in your haste to get out of the infernal muggle contraption.

            ""Should have told you it doesn't unlock without a key or spell,"" Corentin stated lazily as he locked the car. Your cheeks were flushed in embarrassment, and the fear that he would think you were an idiot boggled his mind when it hit him again. Why did you care so much what he thought about you?

            ""Oh,"" was all you could muster as you entered the restaurant. As predicted, the laughter from different tables hit him like a train as soon as the doors swung open.

            ""Are you okay?"" you asked, noticing the sudden change in expression on Corentin's face.

            ""Just a migraine,"" Corentin lied fluidly. It was such a practiced lie he almost believed what he said, himself.

            With no reason to distrust the answer, you helped him to a seat. ""Wait here while I find out where they're sitting."" You made sure he was in the chair before rushing off to find the group.

            When you returned, Corentin didn't think he could stand by himself anymore because of the pain. Why had his friends insisted upon dinner when they knew what an ordeal it was for him? After a month of solitude, he was not used to crowds anymore, especially not at mealtime, when they tended to be at their most jovial.

 

            ""They're sitting outside,"" you informed Corentin upon your return. You couldn't help but worry a little due to the intense look of pain on his face. ""Are you sure you don't want to just go home?""

            Corentin gave a weak laugh. ""I've made it this far already. I might as well stay for dinner, (Name)."" He stood and almost lost his balance. You could tell he was about to topple over when those purple eyes crossed. Rushing forward, you put one of his arms over your shoulder, and he instantly acquiesced to your help, leaning heavily on you as the pair of you made your way outside.

            Color coming to your cheeks again, you noticed just how warm Corentin's body was as he leaned on you. From his pale complexion, you'd assumed he'd have been fairly cold, especially considering how unsteady he was on his feet at the moment.

 

            As soon as you were outside, Corentin felt much better, and took most of his weight off of you. ""You didn't have to help me,"" he told the top of your head.

            ""Don't be silly. You were going to collapse. Of course I had to help you.""

            So there was a difference between you and the other girls; any one of them would have watched him fall to the floor writhing in agony, pointed, and laughed at him.

            ""Corey, my man! Not lookin' so hot,"" Zak said, coming to support him from the other side. ""And this must be the lovely (Name) I've heard so much about from my Miss Mae! Zak Shaw at your service señorita~!"" He grinned widely at you.

            ""Can we get him into a chair before we do introductions?"" you asked, glancing worriedly up at Corentin.

            Personally, Corentin thought Zak's antics were generally amusing and didn't find his laughter too painful to endure, but he was extremely grateful for your request.

            ""Sure, sure. Sorry about that dude, if we'd known how busy it was, we'd have picked a different spot.""

            Corentin shook"
"I know every word in the books which line the walls in my room. Everyone else in this place wonders why I wear my torn up trousers for the fifth year in a row – my ankles are showing, too – and instead of asking for new ones, I ask for a book every time the matron manages to spare some money for us orphans. It’s because they’re stupid and don’t understand the true value of the printed word. No matter, they will come to regret those choices one day. They seem to think that the orphanage will always be there to provide what little there is for them. I know what the world out there is like. Homeless men die on the streets every night. Homeless women whore themselves out to anybody willing. That’s just how it is, but I have no intention of following this cursed pattern. I might have nothing to truly call my own – except for my body and mind, but that is enough.


It will be enough for me to show them all my superiority. I will climb this rotting, broken ladder of society and find a better place for myself. 


I have a sharp mind, an agile body and good looks – that is plenty of proof. I belong above this pile of maggots who eat each other for a few scraps of material. It’s all here; in my head.

Long hallways and many, many doors hold my knowledge. There is still plenty of space; I know my mind has no limits. There are colourful books here and a warm fire which comforts me whenever I’m exhausted after using my powers to keep those fools in line. There is also a small picture frame on the impressive mantelpiece in which I can see a moving, ever changing image as crisp and bring as the real world. It shows a boy around my own age, with bright green eyes full of sorrow and a mop of unruly black hair. His forehead bears the strangest scar I have ever seen, in the shape of a lightning bolt. It strangely warms me to see it etched onto his pale skin so clearly.

He’s thinner than even me and his clothes are almost as bad. He’s made to do chores after his family has gone to sleep and isn’t given food for weeks at a time.

His world looks so much different than mine. There are many strange machines which I have not seen before there and sometimes I wonder if what I can see the future. I don’t let it bother me though. I will find my answer sooner or later, as I always do.

For now, I will settle for watching the green-eyed boy as he curls up to sleep on the broken bed in the cupboard under the stairs. He’s so peaceful when he dreams – a small smile appears on his lips as he whispers something I cannot hear. Wishfully, I imagine his lips forming my name silently.

Maybe I could meet him one day and make him say it and claim him as mine.

Such an imbecilic thought. With that, I leave the luxurious chambers of my mind and settle back into bed, with a fantasy book about time travel and magic tightly gripped in my hand.


Later that night, I dream of him again. 
"
"cut him off. ""You know what you did, Dumbledore! 'For the Greater Good,' wasn't it? No more. Don't try your befuddled old man act on me any longer.""

Professor McGonagall stood then. ""Mister Potter, what is the meaning of this?!"" She shouted. ""You can't possibly-""

The Boy Who Lived raised a glowing sapphire. ""Silence, Minerva."" He snapped his wrist once, and McGonagall fell senseless, the sapphire glowing even more sinisterly for an instant.

Dumbledore's benign smile vanished. Harry smirked back.

""No more blandishments about my mother's love, Dumbledore? Maybe you can send me to live with the Dursley's again. Oh wait,"" Harry's smirk grew wider. ""I killed them already. My real family aren't a bunch of muggles. They weren't even the Potters.""

""Harry, please."" Dumbledore said. ""It is not too late to change things.""

""The only changes we'll have today is your end."" Harry shot back. ""Harry Potter is dead. Call me... Harry Arcturus Neverborn Extremis Black!""

The other students in the hall began muttering among themselves. A few snickered at Harry's new name.

""Now,"" Harry said. ""Will you fight me, Dumbledore? Or will you lay down and die?""

He pocketed the glowing sapphire and raised a new magical artifact. A demon's sword, heritage of his true father. Forged in the flames of a nonspecific, probably vaguely Judeo-Christian Hell. Baptized in the blood of Harry's Veela mother and tempered with angel's tears. The blade did not glow. No, it was filled with unlight. The hall grew darker for its very presence.

Dumbledore sighed. ""I see. If it must be this way... Mister Black, then it shall be. However..."" Dumbledore paused for a moment, stroking his beard. ""May I inquire if that is the particular demon sword that was sealed away in-""

Harry interrupted him again. ""Yes! In the ruins of my father's home- the Iron Death Ice Fortress! My birthright, but for your interference!""

""I see."" Dumbledore's smile returned.

""What?"" Harry snarled. ""You dare smirk at High Overlord Black?!""

Dumbledore raised his hands defensively. ""Oh no, Mister Black. I was just thinking of the last time I saw that sword.""

""When you banished my father and usurped my-""

This time it was Dumbledore who interrupted. ""And I suppose that you read the book of spells sealed with it?""

""Yes, but-""

""And you did the accompanying rituals?""

""Yes!"" Harry shouted triumphantly. ""Even the Dark Rite of Fakshite!""

""Ah."" Dumbledore's smile grew a little wider. ""Well then, stop me if you've heard this one.""

Dumbledore snapped his long fingers once, and then spoke a single word.

""Hubris.""

At once, Harry's sword snapped in two. The pieces rusted into nothing in a matter of moments. The High Overlord Black found himself suddenly dizzy, barely able to stay standing. His new-found power deserted him in seconds; most of his magical trinkets fading and falling to pieces. Dumbledore simply stood there, still smiling benignly.

""Tell me, Mister Black, did you ever wonder what I was doing all these years as Headmaster?"" Dumbledore chuckled. ""You think you're the first special boy to come to Hogwarts? Oh no. It must be every decade or so that one of my students gets it into his head that he could do a better job. Tom Riddle was only the latest. Or... second latest, if we count you.""

""What?!"" Harry gasped. ""But what about the Greater Good and all that?""

""The Greater Good?"" Dumbledore shook his head pityingly. ""I move our society towards the-"" Dumbledore made air-quotes, ""Greater Good, with every student who passes through our doors. A proper education and good friends are worth more to wizard kind than any magical rituals or silly artifacts.""

""And the Sword of Greater Deathbane?"" Harry said. The weight of his artifacts grew too much and he fell to his knees. Around him, students were finally backing away, deserting their spots at the long tables like rats deserting a sinking ship.

""Planted."" Dumbledore said. ""As was the Ritual of True Ascension, the Jewel of Grinding Souls, and most every other mysterious artifact you can think of. I wasn't sitting on my laurels this whole time, oh no."" Dumbledore snapped his fingers once more, and one by one, Harry's remaining items crumbled away into dust.

""You really should have listened to Miss Granger some more,"" Dumbledore chided. ""She'd have known that you can't be half-demon, vampire, veela, and whatever other silly races you've filled in the blanks with at the same time.""

""Ah bollocks."" Harry swore.

Dumbledore nodded. ""Yes."" He drew himself up;"
"I?”  “Ugh, you know he'd be more likely to work with you.” And like that, though the moment of seriousness should not have passed so soon, they were back to their usual banter.  “Is he still bitter over your colors at our first World Cup? Honestly mate, just challenge him to a wand measuring contest and let the matter be done, everyone knows you supported Ireland as a whole and Viktor for his own merits.”  Ron waved a hand dismissively in his direction. “Sure, let's get into a pissing match for the whole Ministry to snicker about. Sorry blighters don’t have enough rumors in the mill as it is?”  Harry sighed.  That, however, was hardly the correct choice of response to a man who went to sleep nursing a headache and woke up drunk instead of the other way around. Ron set his expression the way Ginny would after a row, and under that withering stare Harry held up his hands in surrender.  ""Okay, I'll deal with Rourke."" 

 



Later than expected Harry’s feet carried him before the closed door labeled Emery S. Rourke, Director of Magical Transportation. As expected the man’s wireless was reporting on the finale between Egypt and Bulgaria loudly enough to make out each call clearly, and Rourke’s mutterings underneath when the announcer paused to breath. With such a ruckus Harry did not see much point in knocking. He turned the knob and stepped inside of the wide office overflowing with Quidditch memorabilia and only as many markings of station and books pertaining therein to Portkeys and Floo powder as to satisfy the standard set by Rourke’s predecessors.

“Morning, Emery.” The older wizard, reclined in his seat and staring up at a poster of Ireland on the ceiling overtop the department seal seemed to not hear Harry. I suppose it was for the best that Ron didn't come here today. Unfortunately Harry was also not in the mood to wait around for very long, and when still the director had not acknowledged him even after striding right up to Emery’s desk, Harry drew his wand and silenced the radio.

“-bloody Seeker couldn’t catch a Snitch if it was right underneath his nose--” after a moment Emery’s swearing against Victor Krum paused in mid complaint and he thumped his chair legs back to the carpeted floor, shaking his moppy brown hair into his blue eyes. “What the blazes do you want, Potter? Zaghloul has him on the edge of his wits!”

“Morning, Emery,” Harry repeated dryly. “I need to secure transport for myself and Ron overseas.”

“Oh, that prick?” Rourke scoffed. “Then he can come down here himself unless you’re under orders from the Minister. Now if you would I’d like to return to the match-” and he jabbed at the wireless with his own wand from the folds of a sleeve and the noise returned.

Harry was not amused. “No, we aren’t under orders. This is a personal favor.” He had to raise his voice to be heard, and Rourke waved his hands as if the matter was thus inconsequential compared to the finale and kicked back from his desk again as Egypt scored. It was quite tempting to bewitch the radio to dance through the other stations until it found Celestina Warbeck’s 21 hour tribute to love, but resorting to such a tactic would only be a short lived satisfaction.

One way or another Ron and I are going to be meeting with Charlie tomorrow. Still, he’d rather do this legitimately. A quick Portus might save them a few minutes of wearing down Rourke’s resistance, but crossing the borders would certainly send up sparks somewhere in this and another office and then they’d be receiving a few strongly worded admonishments signed in the Minister’s name at the very least.

He took a slow breath and on the exhale decided to pull a page out of the late Albus Dumbledore’s playbook, and conjured up a large plush armchair. Then he sat down, kicked up his trainers over Rourke’s desk, and folded his arms behind his own head to listen to the match. There were worse ways to spend time than listening to the latest World Cup coming to a close.

For almost half an hour Rourke attempted to ignore him. Harry quietly rooted on Victor and Bulgaria as Rourke swore about both teams, particularly whenever Egypt lost the Quaffle and the score rose in Bulgaria’s favor, on which occasion Harry would whistle softly in appreciation of Victor’s teammates. Rourke kept glancing at him from the corners of his eyes on such moments and his muttering would momentarily pause, then resume with more vigor. Eventually as the hour drew on and the referee called a break following a collision between the Egyptian chaser and one of Bulgaria’s beaters Rourke sat up with a dissatisfied curse.

“Damnation! Alright, Potter, spit it out before the match resumes, and then get the hell out of my office so I can enjoy this in peace!”

Finally. Harry unfolded his arms and lowered his feet to the floor. “We need to be in Bucharest"
"had a choice, a heartbreaking choice, to give in to his desire and to let Voldemort kiss him senseless or run, try to dispel the illusion and destroy the Horcrux… and never know how the touch of the man he had fallen for would feel on his skin.

“I’m going to do much more than just kiss you, Harry,” the Dark Lord announced smugly, his lips turning up into a smirk, immediately making Harry’s heart skip a beat involuntarily. He barely registered the arms unwrapping from around him, leaving him free to back away, reach for his wand or run… but he was transfixed by Voldemort’s handsome features, his high cheekbones, perfect nose, inviting lips… straight, proud posture, a little exposed skin on his neck… he was frozen in place, breathing in nervously. He didn’t dare to break eye contact with Voldemort’s crimson gaze – they were so close now, noses almost touching...

“Then are you going to kiss me or not?” he finally broke the silence, impatient, eager, anticipating. The corners of Voldemort’s lips merely turned up a little again and he remained quiet. Frustrated, Harry closed the gap between them with half a step and put his hands on the man’s chest to lift himself up slightly to reach. He placed his lips on Voldemort’s lightly, nervous and trying desperately to stay calm. He could literally feel the satisfied, victorious smirk form on the man’s lips and then respond to his curious but hesitant actions much more confidently while his hands moved around Harry to hold him close again. He assaulted Harry’s lips with breathtaking ferocity, demandingly and fast. Struggling for breath, he tried to keep up with the pace. The taste of another mouth on his, Voldemort’s taste, was overwhelming. He’d only ever kissed Cho and Ginny before, but this… was different in every aspect possible. Voldemort’s tongue plundered his mouth with swift expertise, the sensation swiping Harry off his feet, quite literally. Voldemort held him tightly though, not pausing his pleasurable assault for even a moment.

Before he realised it, he was being lowered onto a comfortable bed, Voldemort’s body pressing tightly down on him. Large, long-fingered, strong hands roamed over his body and suddenly he felt so, so hot, his body aching to shed every last bit of clothing already. He wanted to be closer, to show Voldemort everything and to see every part of the handsome man’s body as well… he was aroused more than ever before, the need and pleasure blurring his hazy thoughts even further.

Voldemort’s mouth moved to bestow a flourishing of kisses down his neck, surprisingly gentle, enticing an approving moan to rumble in Harry’s throat. He loosened Harry’s tie with a swift movement of his hand and quickly unbuttoned the top of Harry’s shirt, biting along his collarbone greedily.  

Breathing heavily, Harry melted under the man’s touch, easily throwing his head back in pleasure to allow him easier access. His body was eager for more… and that thought sent his mind to a grinding halt. Voldemort ceased his appreciation of Harry’s body and looked up at him, a knowing smirk on his lips, as always. He probably did know exactly what he was thinking…

“You’re hardly a virgin, Harry,” he mused, licking his lower lip a little, his neatly tied back hair now in slight disarray. Harry looked up to the diadem on his head, unable to see it of course and sighed, withdrawing from the man a little bit. “No need to be shy.”

“Well, yeah, but never... with a guy,” he ground out with some difficulty, averting his eyes and desperately trying not to blush. He wasn’t going to blush and faint like some bloody girl! Voldemort chuckled at that, lowering himself on top of Harry again, grinding up against him slightly. Harry squirmed as pleasure briefly flooded his cock at the friction, before it was gone again and he groaned in frustration and embarrassment, because he wanted more.

“Well then, I shall make your first time... spectacular,” Voldemort announced, now moving back again and proceeding to disrobe Harry. “And then you won’t ever want to let anyone else indulge in your body,” he added more quietly, which fell on deaf ears as Harry was squirming under him, embarrassed at being so exposed. Voldemort was still fully dressed, but Harry would soon fix that, attacking his buttons with ferocity matched only by his desire to get closer. The man’s body was impressive, flawless and masculine. Unlike Harry, who was still a bit scrawny and hadn’t taken any steps to maintain his body since he’d stopped playing Quidditch, Voldemort’s body was lean, but healthy and strong. His cock stood erect and proud in front of Harry – somewhat intimidating, really, but he took it in his hand eagerly, stroking it experimentally.

Voldemort was kneeling in front of him on the bed, approvingly"
"They say that sometimes our dreams come true in the most unexpected ways.

The corners of Harry’s lips turned up slightly, going unnoticed by anyone in the ever shifting swarm of people surrounding him. It was a noisy, busy and in general absolutely insufferable gathering and Harry’s brow slicked over with cold sweat at the thought of having to endure talking to all those pretentious witches and wizards who came here to gawk at him.

Instinctively, he sought out the comforting crimson gaze of his husband. Making contact from all the way across the hall full of people, he instantly felt better and steeled himself for the many more hours he’d have to spend in the stuffy, overly populated room.

Now, many things could be said about his husband. That he was a madman, a cruel and ferocious being who cared nothing for the people around him. Maybe that he was an orphan of a cursed bloodline with too much power to be healthy. None of those things mattered though, because – honestly – people could think and talk whatever the hell they wanted and it wouldn’t make any of those things true.

The papers said the marriage had been forced and entirely a political affair.

Harry would beg to differ, but didn’t have the energy to battle the press yet again. His life was far too involved with the Prophet already and if he saw Rita Skeeter again in this lifetime it would be too soon. What he knew and felt in his heart was all that mattered. The golden band around his finger was testimony enough to that, because he could swear to Merlin and Morgana themselves that he’d never get roped into an arranged marriage. Everyone should know well enough that he never followed the rules anyway. He was notorious for butting heads with the Minister for it, but generally came out on top thanks to his popularity and the fact that Fugde was desperate to remain in office and would rather not tempt Harry to try to become the youngest Minister for Magic in history.

No, the political benefits of the union between the heirs of Gryffindor and Slytherin aside, Harry really was in love with Voldemort. It was funny, because a year ago he’d run to the ends of the Earth from an unexpected marriage. Things had changed so suddenly he’d never even noticed when he fell head over heels for the strange, yet enticing Lord of the House of Slytherin. They’d argued over a bill for the protection for Muggleborns out in the Muggle world, sending chairs and people flying with the intensity of their magic clashing as they traded honey-coated insults back and forth. And then, quite uncontrollably, they collided with all the strength of their emotions – lips and hands and bodies coming together all on their own. It had been a violent beginning of something beautiful.

The bill for protecting Muggleborns was revised so many times Harry wanted nothing to do with it ever again, but due to their joint effort, it was fair to both Purebloods and  Muggleborns and, most importantly, protected those who needed it the most. Harry just knew then, that there was more to Voldemort than a man who only looked out for himself. He was self-absorbed and had some serious anger management issues, Harry will forever be the first to admit, but there was something about him that just caught his heart and never let it go.

Now, still reeling from the excitement of the ceremony, Harry couldn’t be happier. His husband – notoriously handsome as always – was giving him a secret smirk from across the hall. It just promised all sorts of pleasurable torture which he would thoroughly exercise on Harry later that night. A little shiver ran down Harry’s spine at the feel of the intense crimson gaze as he tried and failed to suppress a grin from stretching his lips in response.

No one else would know. They could say whatever they wanted, but Harry felt untouchable with Voldemort at his side. He was the luckiest man alive and no amount of pitying stares from strangers surrounding him could change that. Maybe one day they’d see what they’d been missing all along. Maybe not, but either way Harry knew he’d be happy. Taking Voldemort’s skinny, cold hand which gripped his tightly, he felt stronger than ever. Ready to take on the world.

… but first, he could lean in and steal a long, well-deserved kiss off his beloved’s lips.  "
", he pulled away. 

""I'm sorry, George."" 

He'd seen more than enough of this girl in school, starting his fourth year. No matter where he and his brother were, she wasn't far off. Very quiet, always trying to hide behind a group of passing Slytherins, or pretending to ignore them, but it seemed like she was always there. 

""I don't want your pity,"" he grumbled, continuing to ignore her. 

The first time they'd spoken, she'd said the same thing. Bullied by older kids in her own house, she'd been left outside without a coat or her robe. Taking pity on the poor first year had been Fred's idea, surprisingly. Pranks were one thing, he'd said, being mean was quite another. Even if she was in Slytherin. 

They'd snuck out and draped a quilted blanket their mother had made over her shoulders. She'd stood quickly, pulled the blanket close around her shoulders, and glared at them. ""I don't want the pity of two Gryffindor fourth years!"" She had kept the blanket, though. 

""I'm not asking you to take my pity,"" she replied, fiddling with something in her lap. 

""Oh?"" 

""You're not the only person who lost someone that day, George Weasley."" 

George couldn't bring himself to care; Fred had been the only person important who died that day. Aside from Voldemort. And only one of those men's deaths made the world a better place; the other darkened it. 

""You keep asking yourself, 'Why wasn't it me?' don't you?"" Trissie asked, her voice quavering. ""You want to take back the whole battle and hope you can protect him. Keep him from leaving you."" 

George's ear perked up. She was speaking some of his recurring thoughts aloud. 

""I... I feel the same way, George. About Collin. About Fred. About every single person that died in that damn castle."" She lapsed into silent sobs. ""But, there isn't much we can do about it now, is there?"" Tris asked finally, wiping her eyes. ""I'm not saying forget Fred. I'm not saying don't mourn him. But you have to get on with your life."" She took his hand again with both of hers. 

George looked over at the girl; she was no longer the innocent little Slytherin he'd given the blanket to. The scar that marred her face made him wince, and he had to look away. The pretty face of a sheltered sixth year school girl was gone; the tortured face of a woman who'd lived through hell had replaced it. 

""Look at me, George."" 

George refused to look. He had to deny that there were people worse off than him. Nobody could truly be worse off than him; he was only half a person. Nothing could be worse than half a person. 

""It'll get better, George, you'll see."" 

""I doubt that,"" George shot back bitterly, turning to look at the girl again. 

Tris dropped his hand and stood up. ""Fine. Be the pessimist. But let me tell you just how great a life you have. My family disowned me for standing against the Dark Lord. My boyfriend, who was coincidentally my only friend in school, is dead. I'm not old enough to do magic for another month, and I'm homeless. I have no money to buy my school supplies for next year or any way to get a job!"" 

Tris stood there, fire in her eyes as she refused to cry in front of this older man. The man who had been her idol in school. ""I used to look up to you, George. You didn't let anything get you down. Not even Umbridge. But right now, you're being pathetic."" She threw the bundle that she'd been fiddling with at George before storming back into the house. 

He just sat there staring at it, even after Ginny came out and chewed his remaining ear off. ""I mean, really, George? Tris was only trying to make you feel better. You didn't have to be a prick about it!"" 

Ginny eventually went away. George was still staring at the bundle. It was the blanket he and Fred had given Trissie so many years ago. It wasn't the first time they'd passed it back and forth. 

At the end of his fourth year (her first), she'd found the pair stewing over Ginny's disappearance in a corner of the Great Hall. In silent understanding and apology, Tris had draped the blanket over their shoulders and left before any Slytherins would notice her. 

They passed it back to her when they found her crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom the next year. And she'd given it back after she heard that Professor McGonagall had managed to confiscate all of their dung"
"class.  Severus had to suppress every cringe, every gnash of his teeth, every growl that crept up the back of his throat as he listened to the student closest to him prepare her potion.  The venomous glares he was unable to hold back.

Because of the singing.

Why was she singing?  This could be easily explained.  Beyond the black robes and commonalties in her uniform shared by all of the students in the room, there was a touch of sunshine to her outfit.  There was also an annoyingly large and much too cheerful lemony yellow bow in her hair.  The ends of the ribbon swished about as she hummed and sang, and it was all Severus could do not to turn the bow into a constrictor to put her and the rest of the class out of their misery.

Even more an annoyance than the bow was the song.  The song that would be stuck in his head until the next session, when there would be a different song for the potion of the day.  

“Doxy eggs will make it pink

Add one measure and make it stink

Add fairy wings if you are wise

The potion now turns turquoise

Add seahorses, one-two-three

And heat until it all turns green”

Of course, this one actually seemed less annoying that the very first time he heard her singing, during the first year, when it was ‘Six serpent’s fangs we shall mash, and add some slugs, just a dash.  Now stir until you count to four, and for good measure, stir once more.’

Severus sucked air in sharply through his nose as he closed his eyes, and yet, he still glared at her behind the closed lids.  The great blasphemy of it all was that in order to make things rhyme, she had sometimes mixed up the order of operations, and it almost always ended in—

“Aiee!” A small, yet colorful explosion rose up from the cauldron to the left.  Severus kept his eyes on his own concoction now as the professor scurried over to tend to the singed and pouting Hufflepuff.

At least the singing had stopped.

* * *

Head down, gaze upon the floor, books and supplies clutched tightly.  It was Severus’ typical routine when traveling from Potions class back to the Slytherin Dungeon.  Conversation rumbled about on either side of him, and for the most part, Severus preferred to ignore it.  He was about to round the corner to take the flight of steps downward when an unfortunately all too commonly heard chirpy voice announced something meant to be heard by only her companions.

“James Potter is an obnoxious imbecile!”

Severus halted so abruptly that a fifth-year almost walked into him.  The Slytherin ducked around the older student as he mumbled an apology of sorts and approached the trio of Hufflepuffs.  They were all his own age, but he somehow suspected that from the voice he had heard.  A quick look about confirmed that the terrible James Potter was nowhere to be seen.  Severus took one step closer to the now wary Hufflepuffs and uttered one word to his classmate.

“Elaborate.”

“About what?” she asked.

“James Potter.” 

The three Hufflepuffs exchanged looks.  Finally, the girl with the much-too-bright bow in her hair spoke.  “He suggested instead of Potions class it should be renamed Poisons class if I am in it.”

The three Hufflepuffs were quiet and looked over the boy.  It was as if the girls were expecting the Slytherin student to laugh, but he did not, and so the disgruntled student continued.  “Some of us came here to learn things, not just parade around and have everyone tell us how great we are.”  She was pouting again, just as she had been at the end of the class.  “Next week, I am going to work extra hard to get next week’s potion extra right, so that I can use it on that louse!”

“Don’t get sore about it, Buttercup,” advised one of the other Hufflepuffs.

“Yeah!” agreed the other.  “You can show that James Potter he’s not good at everything at the Quidditch game!”

“Gryffindor doesn’t stand a chance against us!”

Severus would have begged to differ, from what he had seen of the Quidditch teams so far this season, but he declined comment and slowly slipped away as the three continued their discussion of the game.

* * *

Severus was currently breaking two of his self-imposed rules.  One: Keep cauldron as far away from all other classmates as possible so that their failures do not accidentally leech over.  Two: Speak to no one.

Part of his time was spent working on his own potion; the other half, he worked as tutor to the girl next to him.  

She held up her prepared sneezewort, and he told her to use half the amount.  She crushed the lovage, and he made her start over when he noticed she had left the seeds in.  And when she started to sing about scurvy grass, he glared, and she stopped.

And in the end, they each had a perfect batch of potion.  

And somehow, James Potter couldn’t figure out which end of"

“It’s not Voldemort I’m scared of,” he says to me one evening, when the sky has been veiled with clouds and the earth smells of fresh rain and the plants slowly waking to life after the cold of winter.

“It’s me,” he admits, not daring to look in my direction even now. “It has always been me.”

I would ask, but deep, heavy silence has sealed my lips for what seems like forever.

“It’s the darkness growing inside of me,” he has trouble saying, even though he knows I could not judge. “It’s the part I’ve always shunned, that which craves subjugation.”

I feel one of his tears fall upon me, heavier than the barrage of rain from the night before.

“I went to him willingly,” he grinds out, clenching his hands while his body shivers uncontrollably in the biting cold. “His words, they had crawled inside of me, taking root before I had even noticed. The worst of it is… I believe them now. He was always right, trying to show me the correct path, even when I fought against him with every ounce of my strength.  I used to believe that everyone could be saved. I tried to save you, too… but that’s not how the world works. He tried to warn me, but I was too stubborn to listen until it was too late. I knew that the only way to protect those I love was to run away, to prevent the war, but I didn’t believe him. I wanted to see the best in people.”

His lips twist as an odd, strangled noise escapes him involuntarily.

“But then the Order decided you were too dangerous. Even Voldemort treats his followers better than that. He gives everyone a chance to reach their potential, instead of throwing away the lives of those who are our future. He has plans, you know. For many centuries from now. He will always do what is best for all of us. Maybe not every one of us, maybe not me, but for the World. He won’t ever stop. I could thwart him at every step, I could fight until my wand was broken and my bones turned to dust, it wouldn’t change a bloody thing.

“You see, there’s one thing he has always had that I could never achieve. He believes in himself and in his goals. I’ve never had this conviction. If I did, we wouldn’t be here now. He has showed me how to fight, how to live. All the Order ever wanted was for me to die to save them. I couldn’t do that…. Voldemort, he… understands. Better than anyone ever has. Better than anyone ever will. We were always meant to end up here, I think. We belong together.”

The tears slowly permeating my skin have stopped now. He looks at me, like he can actually see me, standing there.

“I love him, Ginny. And… I’m sorry.”

I watch silently as he turns back to the stone path, vanishing into the distance slowly. My feet lay anchored in the ground, heavy as the earth itself. I wish I could follow Harry one last time.

 "
"I rasp, and I can actually hear the tiredness in my tone.

“Miss Granger.”

Fuck.

“Password.”

There’s a sigh.  “Miss Granger, you know very well that if I were here to kill you, I’d-“

“Password.”

“Miss Granger-“

“Say the goddamned password!” I shriek, and there’s silence in the aftermath, as echoes ring around the room.

This time, the sigh is one of resigned acceptance.  “It’s my fault they died.”

It bloody well is, you son of a bitch, I think, swallowing heavily, leaning back to open the door.

~~~~~


I pour boiling water into my cracked mug, trying not to wince as some of the liquid splatters (as it does, always, and I’d buy a new kettle or pour more slowly but there’s something real about the pain) on my skin.  “Tea?”  I ask, already reaching for another mug.

“It’s happening tomorrow,” he says grimly, in lieu of actually responding to my question, though he does lean forwards from the old, musty couch he’s seated on to take the mug I hand to him.

Not unexpected news; perhaps it’s what I’ve been counting down to, I suppose.  “Alright,” I shrug.

Maybe something in my tone – the apathy, the absolute lack of I care – surprises him, because he looks up sharply with what seems uncomfortably like disappointment in his eyes.

“Alright,” he echoes.

I blame the not-really-long long day for the fact that, barely ten minutes into the silence, I begin shifting uncomfortably in my seat (a wooden-backed, un-cushioned chair that is the only luxury, other than my bed, I’ll afford myself when it comes to rest.)

Surprisingly though, it’s he who breaks the silence first.  “How are you?”

A humourless laugh escapes me before I can stop it.  “I’m fine” (lie), “just fine.  The business is good, patients are tolerable-“

“I didn’t ask,” he cuts me off quietly, “how Melody Sawyers is.  How are you, Miss Granger?”

I sip my tea, though it’s already cooling.  “Don’t call me that,” I murmur.

A smile curves his lips (but doesn’t reach his eyes, it never reaches his eyes) and he shakes his head.  “Really, Miss Granger, it’s your name.”  I don’t respond, though the way he accentuates every syllable of my – that – name grates against my nerves like little else can, now.  “You can’t let that go so easily,” he continues, obviously undeterred by my silence.  “Just like you can’t let them go.”

It’s entirely possible that the sound of something shattering is the mug when I place it deliberately on the table.

I can deal with that later, I promise myself vaguely as I rise to my feet, striding towards him with my fists clenched.

“What, Professor,” he flinches at that, good, “you mean the way you let them go when you let them die?”

He doesn’t look at me, just sets his tea down on the table softly, licking his lips slightly.

(My eye doesn’t follow the movement of his tongue.  It doesn’t.)

“Perhaps,” he allows, shoulders moving slightly.  “Perhaps not.”

“Fuck.  You.  Professor.  Snape.”

His reply is smothered by the crush of my lips against his.

~~~~~

Somehow, we find ourselves where we always have, ever since everything fell to ruination and I ran, became Melody Sawyers with a dental degree I never started and a practice I never worked in, much less cofounded.

With his head between my legs; my fingers tangled in his hair, pulling and twisting; with the same words dripping from my lips in an incoherent snarl of language and grief and oh Merlin the pain.

“It’s your fault they died,” I hiss.  There’s a muffled sound of what is probably agreement, but it’s not enough; and so I wrench his head back with one hand, the other grasping at his chin and forcing his dark, unfathomable eyes to meet mine.

“Say it.”  The words are barely audible, a breath, and yet he hears.

(Or at least, he knows.  He always knows.)

“It’s my fault they died.”

Staring into that gaze, black and striking and real, that’s the first time I realise he believes it, really believes it.

Slowly, my fingers untangle from the back of his head as I release his chin (though the warmth of his skin lingers against mine.)  Still meeting my eyes, he bends his head back down, almost tentatively.

I nod, blinking back what must be dust in my eyes, before giving up and shutting them completely under the force of bittersweet pain-pleasure that wracks my body.

“Harry,"
"more depressing, however, is the proclamation that wakes him. 

It’s Christmas.

Oh, Remus thinks glumly, bother.

 

It isn’t that Remus hates Christmas.  He doesn’t have a fervent dislike of everything to do with it, he doesn’t avoid it (though more out of impossibility than from any other reason), he just…doesn’t like it.  And sort of hates it.

At first, it was the memory of what Christmas used to be like that left him bitter and annoyed by the whole affair.  Back before he’d been foolish to wander out into the garden at night, after Father had explicitly said no, the monsters will eat you.

…Bother.  Don’t think about that.

And then there was Christmas After.  Christmas After was terrible because, for whatever reason, the lunar cycle seemed to dislike him enough that more often than not, he would pass it keening in his bed, almost out of his mind with agony while his mother fretted by his bedside.  Recovery was always hard, but there was something about the weariness in his mother’s eyes and the frustrated distance in his father’s every movement which made Remus curl within his wolf till his physical recovery was complete and he had no choice but to emerge, reluctant and human.

Hogwarts was better and worse at the same time.  Better because he was away from his parents, and worse because of the same.  Better because the Marauders were with him – loyal from the start. 

Worse because of the pile of presents at the foot of all their beds, and the meagre collection he would wake to find awaiting him.

 

The best thing about this Christmas is that Sirius can – and does – bound over and shift into dog form in time to pounce on top of Remus and lick his face; not slobbery for once, but light and ticklish instead.

(Still just a little disgusting, of course.)

It’s been a few months but there is still something a little strange in not having to worry about James and Peter-

“Padfoot, you berk, if you’re going to snog the poor thing then at least don’t give him rabies!”

It’s the opposite, in fact – Sirius only gets a few good licks in before James is hauling him off of Remus by the scruff of his neck.  Halfway to the ground, Sirius shifts back in time to grab James by the shoulders.

The bed sinks slightly – it’s Peter, watching the two taller boys wrestle, slightly wide-eyed.

“I don’t believe rabies transmits quite like that,” Remus informs his friend mildly, though whether James is actually listening is quite up in the clouds.  “And even if it did, I’m sure that being a werewolf must-“

“Moony, stop talking and help me out!” Sirius yelps, far too dog-like, as James head-butts him in the stomach. 

Peter shifts his weight slightly.  He smells like chocolate and sweat, even this early in the morning.  “Hey, Remus…You don’t suppose I could just start unwrapping my presents?”

 

The moon isn’t due for another five days, so the muscle pains haven’t started yet. 

The moods have, though; the moods that leave him spiralling further and further down the black hole of self-pity that he feels when he takes stock of the presents at the foot of his bed. 

Five presents; one from James, one from Peter.  One from Frank, wrapped in bright blue paper.  Lily’s is neatly tied with an elegant ribbon arrangement that must be hers, because none of the boys could ever hope to do that.  And one from his parents, in the same brown wrapping they always use.

Nothing compared to the veritable mountain that James is sorting through with far too much enthusiasm (though Remus notes with a certain vindictive satisfaction that none have Lily’s distinctive touch). 

And…nothing from Sirius.

Abruptly, Remus stands.  Only Peter seems to notice, making a slightly muffled questioning noise around a mouthful of chocolate. 

“Breakfast,” Remus says shortly.

It’s almost full moon; not his fault that the door slams shut.

 

There are enough people staying this year that the House tables are still stretched across the room.  Remus is sitting alone at the Gryffindor table, staring at a sausage with little enthusiasm, when a book lands on his head.

If he’d been human, it most probably would have given him a concussion.  As it is, he merely scowls at a poor Ravenclaw girl, sitting a table away from him.  She pales.  He almost feels guilty.

Religion and Magic in South-East Asia: An Introduction, it reads.

Inside the front cover, someone has written a series of painstakingly perfect Runes.

They read: Thine ass is most pleasant, oh resplendent goddess of the moon.

 

 

Four gifts (a book, a beautiful everlasting silver collar and two boxes of chocolate), two injuries and one fall-down-a-flight-of-stairs later, Remus still isn’t sure whether he"
"sighed.

""Isn't there another way to do this like civilized beings? A good old duel to the death?"" A beat later Draco dropped unconscious to the floor. ""Well. That was easy.""

Ziggy halted him with a reluctant noise and said, ""Draco Lucius Malfoy has begun his trial. Now sip.""

Is it really worth touching a rim that has borne the kiss of a Malfoy? Of course, he would have felt the same had it been Narcissa. Some blood is tainted. On the other hand… His mind made up, he said so that all in the vault could hear him, ""Let it not be said that a Potter-Black should refuse to walk where a Malfoy has not so graciously gone before."" And he took a swig, the sour, diffusive, coppery taste strong on the tongue and hard down the gullet.


How do vampires get off on this?


Any further sass that he'd had in mind faltered. The vault wavered. He laid a steadying hand upon the desk, seeing double - the surly master-goblin, and a scene of some far away gloomy English day. ""Uh."" He said intelligibly.

""Awaken, or forfeit. The Grail shall answer if you do not.""

Harry sank to his knees, grip still present upon the desk yet quickly slipping, until he had fallen to his rump with his gaze panning up to the swaying lanterns. He could just make out the conversation growing around him as a part of his mind fell away into long centuries past, while another part of his fading thoughts kept his tongue from lolling out the side of his mouth and stopped his eyes from closing.

And then he lost track of the latter.

With a sound like a muggle train-wreck, Harry snapped back into awareness in the middle of a forgotten English field surrounded by hundreds of medieval soldiers in arms shouting war cries. Full iron plate and steel crashed together, maces, war hammers and shields colliding like an orchestra from hell.

Harry clapped his hands to his ears with a curse that would have made Sirius' proud. ""What in the name of Morgana's everlasting rack is going on?""

Several variations involving the remainder of her lovely figure followed as he rolled aside of a handful of knights locked quite literally at the hip and still pummeling each other brutally. Blood leaked like a sieve through mail and ran in thick rivulets down the outside of battered joints, splashing loose with each ringing thud.

Harry's eyes leapt around the violent battlegrounds for a chance to get to his feet and get away. It took him several more moments of narrowly dodging on his hands and knees and, at last, being partially trampled by a pair of yowling jousters, before he remembered that he was a wizard. He closed his eyes and rolled on the spot, feeling that welcome, crushing clutch of Disapparition squeezing him through a pinprick of reality over the literal crushing sensation of iron boots undauntedly stamping his ribs apart. A moment later he could breath again as he reappeared in a grassy plane only a little removed from the brunt of the clashing.

He sat up with a grimace. This was no time to be ginger about the bruising and worse now spanning generously underneath his shirt, as a quick pat down proved he had nothing poking through where it did not belong and everything still attached where it should have been. A shard of splintered wood the size of a Quaffle spun through the air and gouged out the dirt only inches from his left hand as a reminder that this was no place to be for a comparably speaking, naked wizard.

""What did I get myself into now?"" He patted his jeans down and with triumph found his wand holster still tucked away just where he had left it, following Igh'rhuuk's orders in the lobby of Gringotts. And like another train barreling through his brain, he remembered what had lead up to this unfortunate set of circumstances. ""Oh you son of a Quintaped, Ziggy,"" he bit off as he scrambled away from another piece of shrapnel and snapped the holster into place around his right forearm. The supple leather conformed comfortably into place, ready for the correct amount of tension and intent to eject eleven inches of holly and phoenix feather into his awaiting palm.

Finding his feet as the knights continued to bash each other senseless, Harry circled far around them, then began to sight the surroundings for more information. No sign of two particular commanders in charge, or even much in the way of camps, which he assumed meant that the opposing forces had marched and decided to commence battle at once.

No trace of Draco skewered on the end of a pike, more's the pity.

As he examined the dismal landscape further outward, a glint of silver off of a decent knoll to the... north-west, he approximated, caught his eye. Aha. Two horseback men ensconced in unsullied, glistening armor sat there observing the bloody chaos taking place below. Only the taller of the two wore a crown, which meant a noble of some sort. The banners flapping in the cloudy breeze at their backs gave him a moment's hesitation.

"""
"still empty. The silence was soothing; it washed away the clinging stares of strangers from school. The dishes were done quickly and the water in the pan was already heating up. The peacefulness likely would not last much longer, but for now, Harry could sit down and rest, just a little. Looking out of the kitchen window into the garden, he let his thoughts drift. Once, he would have been able to colour the world however he liked – see people who were kind to him and played with him. That was a long time ago, though… before the incident with the letters. It had caused his Uncle to shut him in the cupboard for nearly two months; until they needed him to cook the meals and tidy the house again. Since then, he had stopped imagining – it only ever got him into trouble.


“Some call him a ghost; some say that he is a demon. Some call him a mere mortal…”*3


The passage from the exam was still slowly boring through his mind. The words seemed to echo in his thoughts endlessly.

The red eyes blinked at him curiously.

“Ah, there is it again…” Harry thought, slowly waking from his reverie.

The eyes did not vanish this time, instead glowing mysteriously amidst the shadows of the trees outside. How strange, Harry’s muddled mind supplied slowly. The eyes disappeared again. Harry shot out of his seat suddenly, wide awake. What the hell had just happened? He ran quickly to look out of the window, where he had just seen the flash of red. Nothing was there.

He was almost disappointed. With himself. He had abandoned delusions of the supernatural, but yet his mind insisted on playing such cruel tricks.

The glass was cool against his nose and steam had built up on the lenses of his cracked glasses. Tears were just barely pricking at the corners of his eyes. How pathetic.

He was ready to return to his chores, he just needed a small break. Just a moment, to rid himself of such treacherous thoughts… when suddenly he noticed a man standing in the light of the streetlamp outside. His face was veiled in shadow, but the eyes… they were unmistakeably, definitely blood red. Mesmerizing….

He found his body moving on his own. Like a homing beacon in Dudley’s sci fi games, the man simply drew Harry to him. He walked out of the house and quickly up to the man – tall, thin and intimidating. His body was cold and trembling. He’d forgot to put slippers or shoes on…

“We meet at last, Harry Potter…” the man whispered. His voice was low, almost raspy, but soothing to the ears. “Sixteen years, Harry... and yet it feels as though it was only… yesterday.”

“What?” Harry choked out, paralyzed by the intense stare which held such immeasurable power.

“It is regrettable, but reasonable that you would not remember me, Harry. Forgive my rudeness,” the stranger bowed rigidly, only enough to be polite. “I am Lord Voldemort, the Lord of all Darkness and I have come to take you away from here.”

Harry’s mind was jumping in loops, unable to comprehend the sheer weirdness of the man in front of him. His uncle had always punished him for ‘associating with that kind of people’. Fear run rampant in his mind, paralyzing all thought.

“Do not worry. I shall never harm you,” the man reassured him with a smile. A cold, lifeless smile. “Unless you try to break our contract, of course…”

“Contract?” Harry echoed in disbelief. “What do you mean? Who are you?!”

“I was the one who saved your life, fifteen years ago, when your parents were killed – in return for taking you as mine.”

“Liar! My parents died in a car accident!” Harry took a step back, feeling cold, twisting dread coil in his stomach.

“Did they now…. Then why didn’t you? Why do you heal so easily and re-grow hair much faster than an average human?” Voldemort laughed, not affected by Harry’s accusations. “The truth is right… here…” he grasped Harry’s wrist roughly, too fast for him to react. A long, thin finger traced the exposed, purple veins on Harry’s skin.  “That’s right… it flows in your blood.

“My poison….”

Harry pulled, tried to get away, but the hold on his arm was far too strong to fight.

“It returned you to life that night and bound you to me for eternity. It waited, strengthening your power day by day, slowly but surely… And now, the wait is finally over.”

Rows of sharp, long teeth sank into his wrist without warning. The rush of blood overwhelmed him and the world started spinning. The beating of his heart, suddenly so loud and clear, slowed down erratically, making him cough and gasp, as his body grew hot and his throat constricted with an unknown hunger.

“That night,"
"hold on, to fight back. They were hardly in a position to retaliate though.

Hermione wasn’t taking the loss of her boyfriend well, making less and less level-headed judgements about where they should go next. Harry hadn’t even had the time to mourn his best friend, though he felt strangely empty and... incomplete. He was always keeping his mind busy, thinking of ways to get in contact with any remaining Order members.

And yet, he felt a strange itch whenever he picked up his wand. His magic didn’t feel right, his memories of the battle for Hogwarts were a jumbled mess and he didn’t know what to make of it all.

He was so, so tired and confused. Confused was the worst. It made his mind vulnerable to attack. He couldn’t afford to be so careless, so he pushed all the concerns aside forcibly, focusing on finding the next place to hide and consoling a brokenly crying Hermione.

 

Exhaustion was creeping up on him, but he fought it relentlessly. If he gave in… he could kill another one of his friends while sleep walking again.

 

*

 

In his dreams, he wandered cold, empty halls of Voldemort’s manor. It was always so silent.

Nagini would slither up to him sometimes and perch herself on his shoulders, her huge mass feeling somehow right. He wasn’t scared; it was a dream after all.

Then there were the whispers. Shrill and jittering, they seemed to crawl out of the shadows, always finding him. There was no place he could hide from them.

Tonight felt different though. His magic was unsettled and the whispers, louder than usual, seemed to wrap around him, heavy and suffocating.

 


Don’t tell me what to choose for my Horcrux, Tom. 



How much longer do I have to stay at Hogwarts? Those idiots are driving me crazy.



Marvolo, could you…. Yes… Right there!



 


The whispers wormed their way into his ears, no matter how he tried to shut them out. It was his own voice; he didn’t want to hear it! What the hell was this, some new trick of Voldemort’s?

 


Could you teach me how to control the Inferi?



Don’t say that. I might have killed Cedric, but there is no need for you to spit on his grave. 



Here, it’s… for your birthday.


 

The whispers were getting louder, echoing in his mind over and over again, endlessly. He had no choice. He would follow the damned little voices, consequences be damned. They led him through many long hallways, all devoid of life and light. Harry’s feet felt cold and numb, but he kept on going, urged by the whispers hovering around him.

 


I wanted to at least be there when you killed Dumbledore. It wouldn’t have been suspicious, the old man adored me and everyone knows it.



Voldemort… No, I can’t say it. It would be like you calling me Potter. Just - no. Marvolo, the Heir of Slytherin sounds much better. Mar-vo-lo….



 


Nagini slithered up to him, her cold scales rubbing against his bare feet.

“Tonight, young master returns to ussss… Welcome back,” she hissed at him, turning down her head in an odd sort of bow.

He recoiled, his heart beating so fast it could jump right out of his chest. His head hurt. What the hell was all this? It had to be a nightmare, but if he was asleep, why were his feet so sore? Why could he feel the smooth, cool scales of the snake? Where was he, even? It wasn’t a place he had seen before.

 

The whispers were surrounding him now, echoing in his mind so loudly he could not think.

Follow, don’t think, they said. He waits for you each night, you know?

And there, through the final oak door, was Voldemort. His features looking peaceful, he breathed in and out slowly. He was asleep.

Harry almost did a double take. He had never imagined the bastard doing something so… human. He’d always seemed so far above everyone else, it seemed almost as though he did not need to do any of the things all others did. Draped over a large, luxurious chair in front of the fire, he was relaxed and his right hand was unconsciously caressing two rings on his left.

 

It’s yours, said the whispers excitedly, reverberating in the silence of the room. Voldemort did not wake. Take it. Come back.

 

His mind was reeling, trying to grasp onto anything that made sense in this bizarre dream. His body moved on its own though, instinctively knowing what to do.

The golden ring on Voldemort’s finger had a phoenix engraved on it. It had rubies for eyes and suddenly Harry was grasping it in his own hands, transfixed by it.

Everything fell silent. There were no whispers.

Voldemort’s ruby coloured eyes were looking at him, through him, right"
"'m fine..can we just go inside?"" He asked. ""Stop caring about me...I'm nothing...stop being so nice."" Fred nodded and Dragged Theo in, George followed as Theo sighed in relief at the heat. He was still coughing but not as bad. George Kept looking at Him with a worried look. ""I'm fine."" Theo reassured as they Dragged him to the kitchen, Theo couldn't help but notice How messy and friendly the house was. ""Mom!! He's here!"" Fred Yelled and Theo jumped a little from the sudden noise. Then he saw A woman with red hair looking at him with apron on. ""Oh Fred, George...is this your boyfriend, oh I heard so much about you!""She said. Theo blushed and stammered out ""Y-yeah.. nice t-to meet you."" He smiled shyly as he stood close to The twins as they both kissed his cheek. ""Oh that amazing! What's your name dear?"" She asked as The kitchen bexams more crowed as A bunch of other red heads flocked in, Theo could tell which one was Ron, he was the kid always with Harry, and Ginny, Rom's younger sister. Theo felt like a caged animal as The father, he could only tell cause he was the oldest looking patted his back and Theo cussed a little and Fred looked at him. There was way to much sound and movement going on for the Only son Of Samuel Nott and he tried not to scream. ""Dearie, what's your name?"" The Mom said- Molly...Theo knew she said her name he just couldn't remember when- as Every one looked at him. Theo Felt like his heart was gonna burst. ""They can tell who I am..they can see the scars.. they're gonna hate me"" Theo took a deep breath and said quietly ""Theodore Nott..."" At once he could feel the haterd shot at him, hitting him in the heart like a knife as He realized that He wouldn't be allowed to stag here. The kid with the glasses-Percy opened his mouth And before he could Fred said ""Mom is it okay If Theo goes to our room? He's pretty tired."" Molly took one look at him and nodded as Theo Grew pale. ""Stop it...they hate me.... just leave me."" Theo thought As George Led him to his room keeping his arm wrapped around Theo's waist. He opened their bedroom door and Theo sat on the bed and Groaned. ""They hate me...."" he said. George Shook is head. ""That's not it... they just... ya know?"" Theo looked at Him and said ""yeah they hate me... and it seems like they can see right through me..."" George sat next to him and Pulled him close As Theo coughed. He could hear yelling from downstairs and Covered Theo's ears. Theo Closed his eyes and a shot time later Fred walked in. George Looked at him as He sat On the other side of Theo and kissed his brother. ""So I told them off,  I told them to show some respect."" He said calmly,George looked at him and nodded as he ran a hand though Theo's umber hair. ""Is he sleeping..?"" Fred Nodded and said ""I can see it."" George Looked at him as Fred pulled Theo's jacket away from his skinny frame and George then noticed the Brusie sticking out. His heart started to race as he looked at his brother, who looked Just as mad as He felt. ""This was the one place we wanted him to feel safe."" Fred sighed as George kissed Theo's head and Theo stirred and said ""I didn't do it."" Fred laughed and stood up. ""Come on guys."" George followed and Theo rubbed his eyes and then Fixed his jacket. Fred eyes were locked on him as Theo coughed again. He was starting to regret Tackling the boy in the snow...atfer all Theo got sick so easily. Fred and George grubbed one of their Small lover hands and pulled him down stairs laughing. ""Guys- don't pull- slow down!"" Theo yelped. He rolled his eyes and almost tripped but Fred Then threw him over his shoulder. Theo blushed and said ""H-hey!"" George Looked at him. ""Ya know Fred, he looks cute like this."" Fred smirked as he walked into The living room and Set Theo down, who Hid behind Him and George frowned. Percy didn't look happy and nor did Their father. ""So... Um...your sons are nice."" Theo said to make some sound. Arthur nodded and Theo coughed. ""Fred? Is He alright?"" Molly asked. ""Huh? Oh yeah Mom!"" George yelled back and they both snickered. Theo looked confused but didn't say anything as Fred Hugged him and put his chin on his head. Percy glared and Fred had enough. ""Percy stop glaring! Your just jealous our boyfriend could come over!"" He snapped and Percy rolled his eyes"
"him drained.

When Draco started doing what he’s doing, he thought the procedures would be the hard part; and they were, because for a long time he didn’t know if they were possible (but he dug through piles of books and it was, it is, and he has to do something to fight the nightmares, even if they’re never going to let him go)..  But it’s what comes before, the three pre-consultations that the Ministry insisted upon – that Draco himself insists upon – as a condition of him opening up business.

Nott was right; he doesn’t need the money.  If he did need it, there were most probably a myriad of different, easier (less painful) ways of getting it.

Maybe this is penance, he remembers thinking to himself after the seventh enraged attempt to kill him left Draco with strangulation marks around his neck (and he could have healed them but he didn’t).

But-

Suddenly, the wards sing out, humming through his veins; not in warning, and so after the initial shock Draco lets himself relax into the couch, feeling the fire soak into his skin.

“Winky!” he shouts out, request (no more commands, to no one, ever) implicit as he tries to figure out just who would be here at this time.


No more patients, not as far as I know – Blaise came by last month so he won’t be around  for three more – and…


He clamps down on that last because Draco hasn’t seen his father in two years and nothing’s changed

(and isn’t that always the problem?)

Hush, he tells himself, pushing himself to his feet as Winky opens the door to his private living room.

“Mr Malfoy, sir, it is Miss Hermione Granger who wishes to see you, sir,”

He falls back onto the couch.

 

~~~~~

 

In retrospect, he shouldn’t be so surprised.

But he is, because he can’t understand how they’ve gotten from a slap in third year to this, five years after the old world ended and the new began, as gut-wrenchingly tedious and brutal as before.

(Where this means sitting across the small dining table that Draco has in one of the many rooms in his wing of the Manor, tentatively and awkwardly mouthing at food that Hermione Granger has cooked for him.)

(He doesn’t know whether to be more surprised at the fact that he’s eating Granger’s cooking, or the fact that it’s good, some sort of rolled-up lasagne that he’s too afraid to ask the name of.)

She makes a small sound, a cough or something that seems more an attempt to dispel the thick, repressive silence than a genuine need to clear her throat, and Draco barely restrains himself from flinching.

“This is good,” he tries feebly.

Granger smiles, slight but sincere.

“You don’t have to lie,” she says softly.  He didn’t realise it back in the street the night before, but now he does; her voice has changed, lost its arrogance (confidence) and fervour, become quiet in a sense that doesn’t change with volume.  “I’m not a particularly good cook,” she continues, and her lips quirk before the smile falls away altogether.  “Ron used to…”

Shifting in his seat uncomfortably, Draco racks his mind for something to say to that – but before he manages to come up with anything, she shakes her head.

“Thank you for last night.”

He shrugs, taking advantage of the mouthful of food in his mouth to give him time to think up a response.  “No problem,” he settles for.  “I was in the area.”

Draco winces almost as soon as he says that – over-casual at best, crass at worse – but she laughs slightly.  “You’re not going to ask why?”

Why what is painfully obvious; not just why she was being attacked, but why she couldn’t Disapparate, why someone had tattooed binding symbols onto her collarbone with raw magic.

For lack of anything better to do, he shrugs again.  “It doesn’t matter, Granger.  Eight on one isn’t fair, and they didn’t look like Aurors.”

(Not that that means anything anymore.)

“Thank you, Malfoy.”  It’s the first time she’s used his name since the last time they met, a year ago.  “And it’s Hermione,” she adds, almost as an after-thought.

Draco looks up to meet Grange- Hermione’s eyes across the table, warm and hazel.  He doesn’t realise he’s staring till he finds himself comparing her eyelashes to those of her dreamself – with a start, he looks away.

“No problem,” he mutters again, taking another bite of the food.  It doesn’t feel like it’s enough, so “and Draco, please.”

The silence stretches, but it’s not quite as uncomfortable as before"
