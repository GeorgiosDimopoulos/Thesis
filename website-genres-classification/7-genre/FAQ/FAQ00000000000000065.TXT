1.10 IRS Procedures: Name Changes & Social Security Number Matching Issues
How do I change my maiden name to my married name for tax purposes?
In order to change your name, you must contact the Social Security Administration. They will issue a new social security card reflecting your new name and automatically send us your new name. The telephone number for the Social Security Administration is (800) 772-1213.

How can I correct the spelling of my name with IRS?
The name on the refund check is spelled the way it appears on your tax return. If the address label you receive is spelled wrong, do not use the label. Instead, print the information on the tax return. You can also call (800) 829-1040 and we can change the spelling of your name over the phone.

Do I need to change my maiden name to my married name on my social security card for us to file jointly?
You can still file Married Filing Jointly without changing your name with the Social Security Administration. However, you do need to show your maiden name on the tax return instead of your married name. 
I got married last year. I have filed with the Social Security Administration for name and address change, but my Form W-2 still has my maiden name. Can I send it in as it is with our joint return or do I need to get a new W-2?
You can use the Form W-2 (PDF) you received from your employer. If the W-2 has your maiden name, all you have to do is cross it out and write in your married name. The last name on the tax return is verified through the Social Security Administration. Make sure that the name matches the name listed with the Social Security Administration. Tell your employer about the name and address change so that your current Form W-2 reflects the correct information. 
I got married and I have not changed the name on my social security card to my married name. My Form W-2 is in my married name but my tax forms came in my maiden name. Should I file with my maiden name or married name?
It is important that the name the Social Security Administration has in its system for your social security number agrees with the name on your tax return. You have a choice. You can file with your maiden name and contact the Social Security Administration after you file your return. Or, if you have enough time before the due date of your return, you can contact the Social Security Administration and have your records changed. Please wait 10 days to file your tax return. You can contact the Social Security Administration at (800) 772-1213.
