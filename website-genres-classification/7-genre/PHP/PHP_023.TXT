This my contribution to the plethora of useless, personal home pages on the web. I just figured I should have something, so I wouldn't end up like this guy in the cartoon. Feel free to E-mail me your opinion of my efforts. 
This page has been accessed times since I learned how to do counters.

Hi! I'm Jeff Hibbard, and I work at Bradley University in Computing Services (formerly known as Information Management Services, having been renamed to that from our previous name of Computing Services, before that being known as The Computer Center ... every management change soon leads to a name change). Want to know how long I've been working here? We could measure it by counting the number of reorganizations and job title changes I've been through, but that would take too long, so here are some other clues: 
* When I first came to Bradley, the only way to interact with computers was by punching little holes in cards. 
* When I first came to Bradley, students used slide rules, because portable electronic calculators didn't exist yet. 
* I remember when I thought 300 bps modems were fast (That's 0.3K, for newcomers who only know terminology like 14.4K and 28.8K). The standard used to be 110 bps. 
* An unmarried, childless, normal-aged sophomore I got to know my first year working here has a daughter who completed her 4-year degree at Bradley a few years ago. 
* I remember when the people running this place conducted themselves in such a manner that the local newspaper didn't write stories like these. 
I've collected quite a few pictures over the years of the staff and students I've worked with. Click here to see some of them.

Here's some useless personal information, so I have an excuse to put in all these central Illinois links. I was born July 28, 1953 right here in Peoria, Illinois, but my family moved to Canton, Illinois (about 30 miles away) when I was 5 years old. I graduated from high school there, then came back to Peoria in the fall of 1971 as a Bradley University student, and have been at Bradley in one form or another ever since, although I did commute from Normal, Illinois for a couple of years. 
I'm the faculty advisor for Psi Phi, a Science Fiction organization at Bradley University. My job consists of signing a form once per year. Other than that, they take care of themselves. You should check out the impressive reference material that David Henderson maintains about "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and "Star Trek: Voyager" on the Psi Phi web site, instead of doing his homework.
On June 5, 1993 I married Tzonglee Wu, who usually goes by Sophia around English-speaking people. She was born and raised in Taiwan and didn't come to the USA until her mid-twenties. Her father was originally from Shanghai in mainland China, but fled under gunfire around the time Chiang Kai-Shek lost China's civil war to the Communists in 1949. Her mother is native Taiwanese, raised during that period of Taiwan's history when it was occupied by Japan.
Here is a map for people who have no clue where Taiwan is.
Here's a silly picture of us we had taken in Taiwan, and a somewhat more serious picture.
Sophia wants me to tell everyone that she is now selling Mary Kay products. E-mail her for more information.
Her main job involves writing COBOL programs on IBM mainframes. Besides the modern view of computing this demonstrates, she is also the only person in my circle of friends who thinks Dan Quayle did a good thing when he bashed Murphy Brown. 
This is ironic, since my only son, and biggest source of joy in my life, Chris Hibbard, was born May 26, 1988 to (using Mr. Quayle's words) an "unwed" "professional woman" (albeit one who works for the American Red Cross rather than a television network). His mother and I cooperate very well in taking care of him, and he spends roughly half his time with me.
Here is some of his art work from the front of the refrigerator several years ago, and something else a bit more recent. 
His hobbies are sports, video games and watching . 
But ever since he got a boom box for Christmas (1997), his main hobby has become driving his parents crazy with loud, obnoxious noise that he seems to think is music. 
Here's Chris's latest school picture and a picture from 2nd grade that I really like.
Or check out Chris's debut in the national media.
And here are more snapshots of Chris than any non-relative would want to see
