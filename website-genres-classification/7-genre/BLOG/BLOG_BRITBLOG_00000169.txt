Price Rise 
WARNING, I have my complaints hat on today.Today i recieved a letter from my private health provider, informing me of the impending rise in private health cover costs as of April 1st. I admit, i was half expecting my provider to raise its prices as it has been widely publicised.Six years ago the Aust government reformed (tried to) private health cover. Our public hospitals do a great job, but are short on beds, nurses, doctors and MONEY.Hence, if you need a hernia removed, tonsils out, gall bladder operation etc you can expect to be on a waiting list for at least 2 years. Yes, the hospital will do everything they can to keep you pain free in that time, but you still must wait.Now, if you have private health coverage as i do, if you need any of the above operations and more, you can expect to be operated on tomorrow!!Now, i believe that if you are a high income earner you should be forced to take out private helath cover..A, because you can afford it, and B you free up the public health system, letting those on welfare and the poor have the medical attention they need. It don't work that way here. although the govt did do its best to make it happen.I currently pay $100 AU ($80AMerican ) a month for top private hospital cover for the family. This covers us for a private room in a private hospital, theatre fees, drugs...everything...no out of pocket expenses. Now, i researched for 2 months to find the cheapest provider, and reputable one. Others in Australia pay 3 times that amount and if they have extras ie dental...optical...physio etc...they could pay up to $400 a month for a family.I guess my complaint is that my new rate as of April 1st will be $130AU ( $110 American dollars) a month. $30 is a huge amount for them to add on. I don't mind paying an additional amount.....but over 12 months....$360 is insane. Geez, the interest rate on my bloody home hasn't even gone up that much!

Oh Nooooooooooooo 
NEW laws allowing people to sue their negligent lawyers will be proposed at a national meeting of attorneys-general next week.In a spirited attack on the High Court yesterday, NSW Attorney-General Bob Debus said it was "absurd" and "ridiculous" that lawyers were protected from negligence claims. The plans to over-ride the existing immunity for lawyers, which dates to the 16th century, is in response to a High Court ruling that not only confirmed the immunity but "expanded" it. Queensland Attorney-General Rod Welford said he would support new laws removing lawyers' immunity from prosecution. "There's no particular reason why lawyers should be exempt from negligence," he said. "I'm interested in reform of the law in this area." But Mr Welford said the attorneys-general would have to be careful to ensure the laws did not prevent lawyers from pursuing all reasonable means to achieve justice for their clients or deter lawyers from taking cases they were unlikely to win. "We have to be cautious not to place laws which would inhibit advocates exploring all avenues of a client's representation," he said. Lawyers are the only professionals who have immunity from negligence claims in relation to court work. Australia is one of the last common law countries to have such an immunity for lawyers. The High Court decision on Thursday was in response to a Victorian man Ryan D'Orta-Ekenaike who wanted to sue his lawyer for wrongly advising him to plead guilty during a rape trial. Thursday's decision also expanded the protection to out-of-court work and extended the protection from barristers to solicitors. Mr Debus said the decision by the court was "ridiculous" and he would seek new laws to change it. "Thursday's decision of the High Court leaves Australia as one of the last major jurisdictions in the common law world to continue to provide absolute immunity from negligence for lawyers," he said. "The idea that a patient can sue their doctor for negligence but a client may not sue their lawyer is ridiculous. "This kind of immunity has already been overturned in the UK, US, Canada and, most recently, in New Zealand. It is absurd that the High Court of Australia is digging in its heels." The only dissenting judge on the High Court, Justice Michael Kirby, attacked his colleagues' decision claiming lawyers had no special privilege. "I question why an anomalous immunity is not only preserved in Australia but now actually enlarged by a binding legal rule that will include out-of-court advising and extend to protect solicitors as well as barristers," he said. "With all respect to those of the contrary view, I regard such a decision as legally erroneous, unwarranted and unworthy." The NSW Law Society said the decision did not extend the protection of lawyers any further than that which already existed. "It is fair to say this latest (High Court) decision adds clarity to this position . . . solicitors are now in same position as barristers," Law Society President John McIntyre said. "But all it has done is made it clearer."Ok, well, all i can say if this happens, the courts will then be tied up with bogus bloody claims against lawyers and the public will be waiting even longer for their matter to go to trial. Of course i have a million other things to say about this however i will not bore you to tears.

Blogger Woes 
Heh, this cracks me up. Booger, have just launched their new support service today. Is it because of this service everytime i log on to peoples blogger comments, it pops up.."This blog is not found". This has happened on every single blog i read on a daily basis. Except of course those with haloscan. The thing is, halsoscan has probs too, so i don't see what changing over is going to do, except leave me looking like "Nigel no friends" after eating all my comments!New one for Booger today though, and its never happened to me before, was that it decided on its own behalf to post 3 of my comments on a post without me even being logged in! SPOOOOOOOOOOOOKY!

Why don't you ask me? 
AUSTRALIANS go to bed earlier and have the longest hours of beauty sleep, a new global survey on sleep habits has found.Twenty-four per cent of Australians polled said they went to bed by 10 pm and 31 per cent said they average more than nine hours of sleep a night.People in Asia burn the midnight oil, sleeping later than most Americans and Europeans and then waking up earlier, according to the survey.The poll of 14,100 people in 28 countries and regions - from Asia to Europe and the United States - showed 40 per cent of people in Asia only go to sleep after midnight, compared with 34 per cent in the United States and 32 per cent in Europe.Asia is also the earliest to rise, the survey by market research firm ACNielsen showed, with the Japanese the most deprived of sleep. "There is evidence all around us that people are pushing back their bed times," said Vicky Santos, executive director of ACNielsen's Singapore office, citing distractions ranging from late night entertainment to all-night shopping and the Internet.Portugal boasts more night owls than any other country with three-quarters of those polled still up after midnight, the poll, conducted over the Internet in October, showed.But seven of the top 10 nocturnal places were in Asia - led by Taiwan, where 69 per cent said they only nod off after midnight, the second-highest proportion after Portugal.Half of the 10 places with the most early-risers were in Asia, led by Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation where 91 per cent said they are out of bed by 7am.The Japanese had the least sleep, with 41 per cent managing six hours or less each nightI dunno who does these polls but i am never consulted on any of them. I got to check my eyes when i get up from here, no way do i get 9 hrs sleep. Last night, classic example. LOST was on tv at 8.30pm, i lie down on my bed (big mistake) to watch it. The cat comes in spots a moth in my office next door, she starts chasing it going mental....crap i think to myself, the computers are still on, if she jumps up on any of the desks to catch the moth....ggrrrrr too near to the computers; so up i get.Boot her and the moth out, close the door lie back down. Next thing i know........11.30pm! Fucccccccccccccccccccccccck.....i missed the last half of LOST, lucky i taped it so i finished watching today. I felt like shit....up i get, turn off the computers,turn off the tv, go to the loo.....check on the cat...she's still stalking the bloody moth. Put food in her bowl so she won't wake me at 3 am looking for food.Back to bed i go. Clock...11.45pm. Next thing....."Mummmmmmmmmmmmm....i can't sleep".....a midnight visit from "A" at 12.20am. So up i get again, put her back to bed, i go back to bed. I wake at 2am to every dog in my street barking. I wonder what poor bastard is getting broke into and hope to god it aint me. I wake to what i think is bright lights at 4.30am, car across the road backing out...ggrrrrrrrr..i am soooooo pissed off......i go back to sleep and wake to "A" jumping on my bed at 5.30am........"morning mum"...."can i make a chocolate milk?" Yes............and i think i better make myself some STRONG coffee...........like hell i get 9 hrs sleep a night!

Wacko PJ Jacko! 
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO......Jacko in his pj's heeh. This guy is unbelieveable, he'll stop at nothing to get out of this matter. Thank god its a decent judge preciding. You know, i had a matter here, defendant missed the plane the first day of the trial. Next day, the defendant caught the plane alright, got into a taxi at the airport, but on the way to the court she jumped out and did a runner. We're all waiting, jury was sworn in......lift opens, taxi driver..."ummmm, the lady in my cab did a runner". The judge was so pissed off he issued a bench warrant for her arrest!!

Just checking in. 
I hope i'm not tempting fate by posting this because as you all know folks "it aint over till the fat lady sings", BUT by some stroke of good fortune during the night Cyclone Ingrid decided to track in a north westerly direction, instead of heading south. So, what does this mean? Well for me, it means still sufffering strong winds, high humiditity, and hot days until it crosses the coast. It also means that the threat to me here has gone...yaaaay :) UNLESS it decides to reform after it crosses. This is a rare thing but it has happened in the past.The best thing is that it now looks as though she'll hit in a place where its not too populated. I'm sure most of you have heard of the Daintree, famous for its river,rainforest and crocodiles, well it should cop a battering with rain and wind as will all the coastline above...severely. At least with cyclones we do get time to prepare for evacuation. Majority of islands and populated areas where Ingrid will hit will have sought a safe place. I had my evacuation plan ready, in case the worst was to occur. Heh, my neighbors used to ask me why i never bought a beach front property,preferring to buy one street back. Well, if this cyclone had hit near me, let me tell you, my house would have been beachfront property!!! And, I wouldn't have been charged double the price as they all were when they bought their homes!!I have lived here 15 years, gone through numerous cyclone threats....never category 5 though, and lived through 3 category 2 and 3 cyclones. My house survived very well, no water damage, just pool full of trees..branches etc. The gardens and yard an absolute mess and loss of power for 5 days. Minor compared to what could have been.So i thank you all for your well wishes, they are all so appreciated and shall keep you posted. If you care to look over to the right sidebar and scroll down to My Photos, you'll be able to check out a couple of maps i posted :)
