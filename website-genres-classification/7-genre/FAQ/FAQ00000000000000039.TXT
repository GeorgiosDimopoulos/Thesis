   Subject: E11) What tropical storms and hurricanes have moved from the Atlantic to the Northeast Pacific or vice versa? 
(Stephen Caparotta, D. Walston, Steven Young and Gary Padgett compiled this list.)
Here is a list of tropical cyclones that have crossed from the Atlantic basin to the Northeast Pacific and vice versa. The tropical cyclone must have been of at least tropical storm strength in both basins (i.e. sustained winds of at least 34 kt, or 18 m/s). This record only goes back to 1949. Before the advent of geostationary satellite pictures in the mid-1960s, the number of Northeast Pacific tropical cyclones was undercounted by a factor of 2 or 3. Thus the lack of many of these events during the 1960s and earlier is mainly due to simply missing the Northeast Pacific TCs.
There has not been a recorded case where the same tropical cyclone crossed into the Northeast Pacific then crossed back into the Atlantic.
* Atlantic Hurricane Cesar (July 1996) became Northeast Pacific Hurricane Douglas. 
* Atlantic Tropical Storm Bret (August 1993) became Hurricane Greg in the Northeast Pacific. 
* Northeast Pacific Hurricane Cosme became Atlantic Tropical Storm Allison (June 1989). 
* Atlantic Hurricane Joan (October 1988) became Northeast Pacific Hurricane Miriam. 
* Atlantic Hurricane Greta (September 1978) became Northeast Pacific Hurricane Olivia. 
* Atlantic Hurricane Fifi (September 1974) became Northeast Pacific Tropical Storm Orlene. 
* Atlantic Hurricane Irene (September 1971) became Northeast Pacific Tropical Storm Olivia. 
* Atlantic Hurricane Hattie (October-November 1961) became Northeast Pacific Tropical Storm Simone. 
* A Northeast Pacific Tropical Storm (September-October 1949) became an Atlantic Hurricane (Storm #10) and made landfall in TX. Back to Tropical Cyclones Records Page | Back to Main FAQ Page
