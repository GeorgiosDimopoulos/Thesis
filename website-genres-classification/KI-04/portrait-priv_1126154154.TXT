a bit about me.. 

how to reach me? 

best way is probably by mail or IRC (IRCNet, freenode) Nick: con-fuse. If you wanna have my phone number, please contact me first in one of the ways described above. ;) 

where do I get my money from? 

At the moment I work as UNIX Systemadministrator at the University of Innsbruck in a group named Distributed and Parallel Systems.
