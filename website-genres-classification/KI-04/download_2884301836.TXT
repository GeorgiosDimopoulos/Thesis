Download the stable version of the Nessus Security Scanner for Unix-compatible systems :

The Nessus Security Scanner relies on the following items: 

* GTK - The Gimp Toolkit, version 1.2

GTK is a set of Widgets (like Motif) which are used by many open-sourced programs such as The Gimp. GTK is used by the POSIX client nessus. 

Download it at : ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/v1.2. 

Note : If your system comes with GTK, make sure that you have the gtk-config program installed. If you do not, install the gtk-devel package that should come on your distribution CDROM.

Note #2: If you do not want to install GTK and/or if your system lacks X11, then you can compile a command-line client by doing 
./configure --disable-gtk
in nessus-core

* OpenSSL (optional but heavily recommended). OpenSSL is used for the client - server communication as well as in the testing of SSL-enabled services. Get it at http://www.openssl.org.

Download and installation

There are two ways to install Nessus : 

* Solaris Users
Solaris users can now download pre-compiled Nessus packages from Sunfreeware.com 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* The easy and dangerous way (ala ximian gnome) 
If you are installing Nessus from a computer directly connected to the internet that has lynx installed, type this command (NOT as root! ) : 

lynx -source http://install.nessus.org | sh 	

This method is considered as dangerous in the sense that if you do it, you are running commands that directly come from the internet. If someone is poisoning your domain name server, he may have you execute arbitrary commands as the user you will type this command as. The good point is that it completely automates the installation of Nessus, so if you are not under attack, you'll save some time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* The easy and less dangerous way
Nessus also comes as a standalone package which auto-installs itself. To use it, download the script nessus-installer.sh (under the directory nessus-installer/, see the mirrors below) and type : 
sh nessus-installer.sh

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* OR the usual and boring way : You can also install the Nessus tar archives individually.
To install Nessus, you have to download and compile these packages in the following order: 

* nessus-libraries 
* libnasl 
* nessus-core 
* nessus-plugins 

See the compilation instructions if you have never compiled any tarballs before.
