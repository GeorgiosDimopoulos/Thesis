Sex
Naomi bought me Belle de Jour's Book yesterday. It has sex in it you know. And so do a lot of my favourite blogs. 
I'd love to be able to write like that. Tales of teenage sex. I may be 17, but I do live and sleep with my girlfriend, so it's a re-occurrence (thankfully). So I have often thought of including passing mentions in entries, but I get worried. 
* I'm a boy. Currently all I read in this genre is by woman, ignoring the e-mailed tales of a gay tour rep in sitges to friends. Would it instantly become sleazy coming from a straight lad? 
* I'm a boy boy. Under 18. Is it illegal to tell tales like that? 
* Lack of anonymity. Although my parents have learnt from experience not to read this blog, I still have people I know reading this blog who it would be awkward for them, or me, to read such stuff. Plus I have potential web design clients reading this, &#8220;finally in my portfolio, a finely designed website where I reveal what I did last night.&#8221; 
* Mixed content Further confusion to what this website is actually meant to be. Today, details of a passionate night. Tomorrow, the latest CSS positioning method. 
* Fear I would be terrified of saying something completely inappropriate. This blog has taken ages to think through, and it doesn't even have any sex in it, just from fear of making some bad cliché or saying something cringe-worthy (probably my biggest fear, cringes) 
So I think I'll just stick to more normal teenage thoughts, like A-level woe. They, like, soooo suck.

Songtime
Because I do charity. Because this sounds fun. Because I need a blog. Because I want to put my link on that list of good links. (But if anyone respectable came here, I'd be oh so embarrassed, it's still such a mess) Because I need a blog to pull me back off the bottom of that list on the left (the one to embarrass the others into blogging more often, not me)
I'm going to choose a song for this.
I feel it needs to be disco cheesy, but not too much. It needs an edge of geeky cool. And scissor sisters was stolen. (there goes olivia's) So I choose The Appolinaires with the smash hit ska toon "The Feelings gone".
(I'd stick some cash in myself, but I'm skint, and heck, I volunteer at Oxfam now, that'll make up for it)

To keep you entertained
I've been playing with php and mysql a tonne during the current renovation of abscond.org, and i threw together something that made me and a few others smirk, so here it is.
A randomly selected comment from any of the blogs i host.
Paul said Not too soon then. 
Refresh to get a new one. Comment you're favourites.

Scheduled Maintenance
For your convenience, Abscond.org is gonna be dodgy for a few days.
To get my arse into gear, I will be uploading new templates, pages etc. when they may not be entirely stable.
This will result in a reduction in our highest standards, i.e. ugliness and broken links.
A bus replacement service will be in place, but this will be too crowded for any use.
Edit: What's that gap below in IE? go. away. (stupid IE, go get a proper browser)

In the news
To fill the gaps produced by work, work and chores, I'm going to run through the news in brief, followed by personal comments/expletives.
Bill Gates receives honorary knighthood
Proud American and billionaire Bill Gates is to receive an honorary knighthood from our Queen.
We now have a good-for-nothing weasel out to protect our country. Hurrah.
Some police are racist
Surprise!
Use mine and Paul&#8217;s foolproof racist detector test:
Q1. An old lady struggles to climb the stairs to the bank. Do you... A: Rush to help her B: Hit her with your truncheon C: Find the nearest non-white and hit them
More than 50% C's should be a fail.

Where is my toy?
Post half-term/pre AS coursework deadline and revision stress depression has me playing my "songs to die to" play list. (Don&#8217;t worry; it's not as bad as it sounds. It's all my most blissful and fulfilling songs)
I really just want to make the most amazing and beautiful thing on the Internet. Any ideas?

Shrove
Pancake day on a day i don't start college 'till 3.15 means me and Naomi have 18 pancakes for breakfast.
We eat 17, and have a fight with the last one.
And I can still see the sea out the window, and it's sunny. Imagine that.

Ska Sunday
Heaps of fake computing coursework to do, but with glasses that fall in half when i look down, I keep seeing you in those new clothes that make you oh so nice.

Gar.
Slowly but surely, the charity cases I gave blogs to to keep them out of trouble are blogging better than me.
Something has to be done.
Like parties and new templates and general joy.
