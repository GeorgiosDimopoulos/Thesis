Lloyd Gregory Music	  Rate It! 	
Guitarist Lloyd Gregory plays a smooth style of jazz guitar that is rooted in the traditionalism of Wes Montgomery and Earl Klugh. On his fourth ablum, FREE FALLIN', he proves he has his own distinctive, highly enjoyable style. After a few listens you soon realize Gregory has absorbed, cannibalized and then remolded those musical influences into his own sound. Subtly mixed in with the jazz sounds are R&B, rockandroll and flamenco guitar. For more information check out www.lloydgregorymusic.c

Modern Guitar Quintet	  Rate It! 	
The sound of the Modern Guitar Quintet is based off of modern composition theory and approaches, while at the same time being very aware of melody and rhythm. Another factor that sets the group apart is the give and take between reading the charts and improvisation. Aside from more traditional ad libs, the arrangements are kept alive and fresh by the constant variations, all while remaining a focused, cohesive group. The balance of all these factors gives the group their unique sound.
