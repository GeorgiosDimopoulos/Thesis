About Me
Name:hide3 
Working as a member of the media in Tokyo, Japan. Lived in the States thru my teenage years. Just a diary to start a renewed motivation to pursue a higher stage in my duties in the media and to restart my challenge to a fulfilled private life in this inorganic city, writing down what I see, think, and deliver.

Just like starting over...  
No I ain't singin' John Lennon. But the meeting today showing our bosses the 3rd edition of the preview ended up in a wrangle tangle... I thought we had our goal in sight, but after the meeting it's now OUT in the universe somewhere far away... We have to reorganize and straighten out our objectives once again. What are we trying to say in this piece of work!? The viewers wouldn't understand our stance without a clear plot! So the whole staff engaged in editing, discussed all night and found some space to breathe. Let's try the new strategy, and rebuild the story! Let's get some sleep and roll again!!

Oh no... look at what time it is...Will I survive? Only god knows...So let the DJ play the music to stir up the fire in my heart!!Burning Heart by Survivor (from Rocky IV: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)Two worlds collide - rival nations,It's a primitive clash - venting years of frustrations,Bravely we hope against all hope - there is so much at stake.Seems our freedom's up against the ropes.Does the crowd understand? Is a east versus west, or man against man,Can any nation stand - alone.*in the burning heart - just about to burst,There's a quest for answers, an unquenchable thirst,In the darkest night - rising like a spire,In the burning heart - the unmistakable fire.*In the warriors code - there's no surrender,Though his body says stop - his spirit cries - never!Deep in our soul a quiet ember,Knows it's you against you, it's theParadox that drives us on -It's a battle of wills, in the heat of attack,It's the passion that kills -The victory is yours alone.(* repeat)

End of an era?  
Jockey Yukio OKABE the Iron Man (on FUJI TV) Tiring operations continued all day...Discussing, arguing, and adjusting, on and on and on... We must walk this path to reach the glorious goal.And farewell to the iron man! Watched the recording of Sunday's horse racing show. Today's special guest was the great ex-jockey Yukio OKABE who had just announced his retirement.2928 wins (JRA only) in 38 years of racing, constantly being one of the top jockeys for a long time.After I started betting on horse racing, his name was always on the boards of big races. His partnership with the invincible triple crown winner Emperor "Symboli Rudolf" is a legend. An everlasting legend.Cool judgement throughout racing was his ultimate weapon. With many foreign based jockeys riding now in Japan, it's sad that we won't be able to see the Japanese veteran's skills of driving the thoroughbreds into high gear at the last furlong.End of an era has arrived with many talented jockeys retiring in recent years. Will this lead to chances for the younger? Let's see if new heros will emerge!

Ten more days to go  
Editing and adjusting all day. And this is only the start of the inferno to come... The top news on the papers today was about Horiemon's Livedoor winning its appeal to justice. But whatever's going on in the business world or whichever nation is battling the war on terrorism has nothing to do with me when I'm in this mode. Brushing up the report and finishing it up into a piece of merchandise is all I long for. Tons of efforts will be poured in for the next ten days.

Nagoya Heading for Tokyo. A brief stop in Nagoya Station of Japan Railways. Many businessmen were on theHikari super express bullet train heading east. I'll be back in my headquarters office starting the most tiresome part of my job...Yes... EDITING...

Singing in the rain  
rain, rain, rain... It was a sore day with continuing showers from the morning. It's always tough to run around in the rain to find clues for reporting. With limited time on location, keeping the quality high is a severe task. Very challenging when many decisions are needed on the spot. My brain rolls a thousand times more than usual to think of ways to make the report more specific and convincing. This is the hard part but also the fun part of my job.

So I'm here again!  
back in oysters' village!! In this village, an all-you-can-eat oyster party can be set for just 2000 yen per person! Believe me, you can eat 50 of them instantly! The tasty flavor induces you to an endless rotation of cracking the shell and chewing off the good part. The season will be over this month, and then we all have to wait till next fall for it to start again. Well at least this time, I'm not here for the treat. The treasure I'm looking for are real clues for my report. At least I'm getting a warm welcome here by the community. Thanks to the oyster party I was invited here in the weekend. It was really helpful to blend into the area, as winning trust from the residents is the key to reporting in rural areas!!

Another day in the countryside!  
a nice view, isn't it? I've always thought how the world is endless and the seven seas lead to infinity. This is true in many ways, but since I ain't no adventurer and at least life is not eternal, there's only limited ways to experience it. Japan is a small island country compared to many fascinating nations of this world, but there's still many cultures and specialties to discover buried in obscurity. Some are so common to the people living in the area that they feel nothing in particular about them. But as a foreigner looks at them in different angles, a new story emerges. I feel joy in finding these treasures and I believe there's more to find in this small but dense nation. I feel lucky I'm not just a tourist hangin' around, but a journalist that has an obligation to think about how and where to find the hidden recipes and think how to serve the new dishes filled with ideas that will have never been reported without myself doing so. Well I'm not always a fighter, but at least I have a chance to make some noise by reporting. Thanks to my job, I can be at the scenes and move on to evolution just doing my job in a wonderful country where much more changes are needed with lots of homework left to be done.

Back in TOKYO  
buildings again... Well, I think I wasn't dreamin' yesterday. But my stomach is doing fine! How I digested 50 oysters; I have no idea... Anyways it's the inorganic view again with bunches of buildings in my eyes. But it's still home sweet home. Lots of work waiting... And laundry too...It's gonna be a long week and I'll be keeping track of this diary on my mobile computer because I think I won't be able to update it for a while... Chao!!
