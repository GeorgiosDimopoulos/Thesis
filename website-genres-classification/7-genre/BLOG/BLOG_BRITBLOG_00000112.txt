bahamas honeymoon
According to ancient traditions, the word "honeymoon" is based upon the practice of newlyweds drinking mead, called bride ale, which was produced from fermented honey. This beverage was consumed during the first month (and therefore "moon") of marriage. The fermented drink supposedly increased virility and fertility and, consequently, the first month of marriage was referred to as the honeymoon. posted by Weight at 12:24 AM 0 comments
