On this site, read about Renting DVDs from AnotherDVD. Most online dvd rental companies provide a rental "queue" service. By using a rental queue you can select a list of movies in advance. When you mail one movie back the next movie in your queue is automatically sent. By using your rental queue you will always have a new supply of movies to watch. - As soon as you finish watching a movie send it back. Most online rental services provide postage paid envelopes. Once you mail a movie back you will then be sent the next movie in your queue. By doing this you will maximise the value of your dvd rentals membership.
