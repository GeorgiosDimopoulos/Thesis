14.3 Electronic Filing (e-file) and TeleFile: Due Dates & Extension Dates for e-file
I'm in the process of getting a name and social security number mismatch error corrected with the Social Security Administration. In the meantime, what can I do to avoid a penalty notice for not filing my tax return on time?
If there is not enough time before the due date to get the IRS records updated from the Social Security Administration, you will need to file a paper return by mail. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.

I don't owe taxes. Can I file electronically after April 15th?
Yes, you can electronically file your return after April 15th, however to do so you must file Form 4868 (PDF), an Application for an Extension of Time to File, on or before April 15th . If the extension is timely filed, you have until August 15th to file your return. If the 15th falls on a weekend or federal holiday, you have until midnight the following business day to submit your extension or your tax return. If additional time is needed please refer to the instruction for Form 2688 (PDF), Application for Additional Time to File US Individual Income Tax Return. Please note that the Form 2688 is not an automatic extension and must be approved by IRS; if it is approved you may have until October 15th to file your return electronically.

How can I send in my tax return before April 15th when e-file won't accept a wrong social security number?
You can file a paper return. You will still need to fix the problem with the social security number in order to file electronically in the future. Contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.
