KartOO visual meta search engine  

                   KartOO is a metasearch engine with visual display interfaces. 
                  When you click on OK, KartOO launches the query to a set of 
                  search engines, gathers the results, compiles them and 
                  represents them in a series of interactive maps through a 
                  proprietary algorithm

                  KartOO uses FlashPlayer to draw interactive maps. This 
                  extension is already installed on 90% of the browsers. If you 
                  cannot see the maps, please click here to install FlashPlayer.
                  You can also use the HTML version with results in the form of 
                  classic lists.
