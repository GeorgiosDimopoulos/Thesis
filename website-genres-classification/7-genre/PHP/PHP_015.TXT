I hold a joint appointment as Professor in UCSD's CSE department and Senior Fellow at the San Diego Supercomputing Center. I am currently on leave, and not looking for new students. 
My current research focus is heterogeneous computing. 
Other research areas I work in include: performance programming and hierarchical tiling. Here are some of my recent papers. Some courses I've taught include graduate algorithms, parallel computation, architecture, and performance programming. 
Here's a short biography. 
Here's a picture from the cover of my CD of new-age-y music.
