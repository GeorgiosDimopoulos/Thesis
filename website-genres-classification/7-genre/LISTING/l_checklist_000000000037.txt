Checklist to Evaluating Web Sites
Why evaluate Web sites? No one has judged the quality or accuracy of the information found on the World Wide Web before you come across it, so you must evaluate the information you find. Some Web site are created by experts; for example the UM Libraries' Web site is authored by librarians who have expertise in the field of information science. The vast majority of WWW sites are designed and authored by non-experts.
