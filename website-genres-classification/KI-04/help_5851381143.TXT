* What is the difference between an action contributed by Working Assets versus actions contributed by advocacy groups?
 Actions on ActForChange that are listed as "contributed by" an advocacy group are presented to users as a service and not as an endorsement of the specific action. Working Assets did not fact check these actions for accuracy, but rather relied on information gathered by the advocacy groups to write the summary of the issue and the suggested e-mail letter. Actions contributed by Working Assets are fully endorsed, checked for accuracy, and written by Working Assets.
