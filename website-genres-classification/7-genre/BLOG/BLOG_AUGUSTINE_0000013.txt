LETTING GO
I have handed over my baby, Bloggers Parliament, to its current members. No, it is not a cowardly thing to do. Like others who resign from Parliamentary duties in the real world to "spend more time with their families" I have realized that I owe it to my muse to pay more attention to her than to anything else. Who is my muse? It's not who you think it is. My muse is me and I am she. When I neglect her to busy myself with worldly matters, she turns into Natalie and I disappear into the mist. This cannot be allowed. So, dear baby BP, you don't need me anymore. Sob quietly. Go to your new family who will look after you and feed you with new ideas and new purpose. I will watch over you from the sidelines and perhaps, now and then, venture a comment. But you're on your own now.

FOR SALON'S SWEET and/or SOUR SIXTEEN SERIES 
Dick Jones, he of the famed Patteran Pages where poetry meets wit meets drama meets history meets Dick and family, alerted us to the current Salon series of Portraits of the Artist as a Young Prat of Sixteen. So since we never miss a world series, here is our entry. The location is a farm in deepest Pennsylvania, the season is summer and the year is none of your business.

A TRUE CONFESSION REVISITED 
Not so ghostly Demian, writer and creator of the increasingly popular and inventive Doodle Blog, has cleared the noxious fumes of anger from my head with his heartfelt review of the long lost
 "Augustine's True Confession", my slim cri de coeur from a few years back - oh allright, fourteen years back if you want exactitude.
Read his review (Feb.22) and then order this book. Yes, you can actually order it, now! From me. I'll even sign it.
NOTE: I now have a PayPal Account.

SYMANTEC AND FedEx: BUYER BEWARE!
(File under: Be angry until the matter is resolved, not a minute longer) 
To cool down and create a soothing atmosphere before I launch into this teeth-clenching tale, here is the view from my front window as night begins to fall here in London. It has nothing to do with the subject of this post, which is below the picture. 
Last month, anxious about all the viruses going round, I decided my Mac needed more protection from the evil alien bugs. I already had up to date Norton Anti-Virus and Norton Utilities but I wanted their new Internet Security 3.0 package which includes firewall. So I go to the main Symantec website, as one does, expecting to download this software directly. No way! As a Mac-using outcast (and still stubbornly on OS9.2) how could I presume to be allowed a simple download? I must order it by post from U.S.A. Punished but determined, I go to the ordering page. There I am asked: how do I want the package to be sent, by FedEx? Or by FedEx? A mere "airmail" option is not available. I think: well, it's only a small lightweight CD, how much can FedEx charge to deliver that? $42.95 that's how much. The software is $69.95. Swallowing my outrage, I sign away $112.90. Wait: this is not the end of the story. A few days later, a very large box is delivered to my door by FedEx. I sign for it (unsuspecting), open wasteful wrappings and install the software; it seems to do its job. About ten days later, I get a bill from FedEx for £16.12 (about $30) for "administration fee" and V.A.T. That's when I blow a gasket. I write righteous anger-filled letters to both Symantec and FedEx, berating them for their deviousness, greed and downright deception. Do I get abjectly apologetic replies and cancellation of this extra charge? No. I get standard form letters basically saying it's all my fault. And if I want to return the software for refund, I'm told it won't be accepted if I've opened it. This is *ten days* after delivery and of course they know I will have bloody opened and installed it and that they will therefore refuse a refund. Now, am I paranoid to think that Symantec and FedEx are in cahoots on a nice little extra earner for them both?
I hope Symantec and FedEx are listening: I'm not paying the extra, you got that?
Sorry for the rant, dear visitors and friends. The picture is nice anyway, isn't it?

SIXTH MOLTUAE: FOLDED THINGS

FIFTH MOLTUAE: RANDOM THINGS
Asked my digital camera to participate in this project to document the undocumentable. If you focus on anything - anything at all, any detail of the flotsam and jetsam of your everyday surroundings, just randomly wandering around, you collect jewels. Random jewels, fragments of the marvellous. It's all beautiful, all of it, stunningly so. Even the detail within the detail is beautiful. Extraordinary bits of a magic carpet that stretches to eternity. After lining up the pieces, I gave them a twist , a wave motion. The result is below and I'm dazzled, lost in this translation from the familiar to the unexpected, the random beauty of every thing

ANGER NOW PLAYING AT THE SEVEN VICES CORRAL 
I am now free from anger since I've let it all hang out at Common Beauty. Not really. There's still plenty in my cupboard to use when I run out of joy. What I've noticed is that as time goes by, I'm less and less angry about personal issues but more angry about impersonal ones, like the state of the world.

A VALENTINE DANCE OF JOY 
When for no particular reason or for some particular reason you are filled with lightness, the very bearable lightness of being, and your limbs move of their own accord, the music you choose fills the room and you dance dance for one and all those you love and for those you have never met that you would love and your body bends with the rhythm responding to every note and you are completely totally unmistakeably yourself and at the same time lost to yourself and you know in every fibre of your being that this is it , this is joy, this is the way it's meant to be, this is what you are meant to be.
And today I got an e-mail from a stranger, Cass Brown, who is dying of cancer but wait before getting out your handkerchief and your pity: go to his blog where you will find the real power of joy. It shines out of his words and his heart like a beacon. This dance is for you Cass, stranger and friend. You have found the solution: it is joy.

MY STUDIO 
I said I'd take a picture of my attic studio so voilà, just to put something here while I'm thinking. The unfinished painting on the floor (of parents when young) might be by Natalie or by me but not by both together.The green wheel belongs to the etching press.

SLOTH AND OTHER VICES 
Over at Common Beauty's far from common blog, there are brand new versions of those old familiar Seven Deadly Sins or, as our hedonistic society prefers to call them: "Pleasures" or, more bohemianly: "Vices" . Anyway, original views of the magnificent seven have been invited by CB and I have contributed one I know something about: SLOTH. Go and read all about it, not just by me but by some proper writers and poets. I have also sent CB my take on ANGER which will appear in due course. I am indebted to him forever for finding the perfect job-description for me: "Augustine is a Draw-Thinker" said Common Beauty.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON
Here is the view from my back window today.
Shadow painting abstract patterns on the winter light.
And here is the worktable where I am not sitting. 
And here I am at the Mac, about to switch it off and do something else.

TIME PASSES 
Too much to do, too little done, too many ideas, I keep hopping from one to the other like a demented grasshopper, but slower. Hop...hop........h...o...p. One of those hops produced a new panel for the gnovel. One measly panel. Allright, it took quite a long time even though it looks quite small over there. What the heck, I'm going to put it here as well as where it belongs and I'll make it bigger. You still have to go to the gnovel to see the bottom half of it.
