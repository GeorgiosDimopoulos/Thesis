The Lonely Street 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
The Lonely Street
School is over. It is too hot 
to walk at ease. At ease 
in light frocks they walk the streets 
to while the time away. 
They have grown tall. They hold 
pink flames in their right hands. 
In white from head to foot, 
with sidelong, idle look-- 
in yellow, floating stuff, 
black sash and stockings-- 
touching their avid mouths 
with pink sugar on a stick-- 
like a carnation each holds in her hand-- 
they mount the lonely street.

Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
Light Hearted Author
The birches are mad with green points 
the wood's edge is burning with their green, 
burning, seething--No, no, no. 
The birches are opening their leaves one 
by one. Their delicate leaves unfold cold 
and separate, one by one. Slender tassels 
hang swaying from the delicate branch tips-- 
Oh, I cannot say it. There is no word. 
Black is split at once into flowers. In 
every bog and ditch, flares of 
small fire, white flowers!--Agh, 
the birches are mad, mad with their green. 
The world is gone, torn into shreds 
with this blessing. What have I left undone 
that I should have undertaken? 
O my brother, you redfaced, living man 
ignorant, stupid whose feet are upon 
this same dirt that I touch--and eat. 
We are alone in this terror, alone, 
face to face on this road, you and I, 
wrapped by this flame! 
Let the polished plows stay idle, 
their gloss already on the black soil. 
But that face of yours--! 
Answer me. I will clutch you. I 
will hug you, grip you. I will poke my face 
into your face and force you to see me. 
Take me in your arms, tell me the commonest 
thing that is in your mind to say, 
say anything. I will understand you--! 
It is the madness of the birch leaves opening 
cold, one by one. 
My rooms will receive me. But my rooms 
are no longer sweet spaces where comfort 
is ready to wait on me with its crumbs. 
A darkness has brushed them. The mass 
of yellow tulips in the bowl is shrunken. 
Every familiar object is changed and dwarfed. 
I am shaken, broken against a might 
that splits comfort, blows apart 
my careful partitions, crushes my house 
and leaves me--with shrinking heart 
and startled, empty eyes--peering out 
into a cold world. 
In the spring I would be drunk! In the spring 
I would be drunk and lie forgetting all things. 
Your face! Give me your face, Yang Kue Fei! 
your hands, your lips to drink! 
Give me your wrists to drink-- 
I drag you, I am drowned in you, you 
overwhelm me! Drink! 
Save me! The shad bush is in the edge 
of the clearing. The yards in a fury 
of lilac blossoms are driving me mad with terror. 
Drink and lie forgetting the world. 
And coldly the birch leaves are opening one by one. 
Coldly I observe them and wait for the end. 
And it ends.

Light Hearted William 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
Light Hearted William 
Light hearted William twirled 
his November moustaches 
and, half dressed, looked 
from the bedroom window 
upon the spring weather. 
Heigh-ya! sighed he gaily 
leaning out to see 
up and down the street 
where a heavy sunlight 
lay beyond some blue shadows. 
Into the room he drew 
his head again and laughed 
to himself quietly 
twirling his green moustaches.

The Widow's Lament in Springtime 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
The Widow's Lament in Springtime 
Sorrow is my own yard 
where the new grass 
flames as it has flamed 
often before but not 
with the cold fire 
that closes round me this year. 
Thirtyfive years 
I lived with my husband. 
The plumtree is white today 
with masses of flowers. 
Masses of flowers 
load the cherry branches 
and color some bushes 
yellow and some red 
but the grief in my heart 
is stronger than they 
for though they were my joy 
formerly, today I notice them 
and turn away forgetting. 
Today my son told me 
that in the meadows, 
at the edge of the heavy woods 
in the distance, he saw 
trees of white flowers. 
I feel that I would like 
to go there 
and fall into those flowers 
and sink into the marsh near them. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Reality is encountered reaching a decisive point. The persona here is a widow and the reader can plainly gather she has lost her husband of thirty five years. She experiences an overwhelming of whiteness in the blossoming trees. The flaming "cold fire" predicates as paradox against the new green grass and foreshadows a life gone drab against the bright yellows and reds in her courtyard. The whiteness smothers the flame physically and emotionally and words progress; "formerly" and "before" to "this year" and "today," all bring into focus the immediacy of her loss. Emotional and descriptive, Williams positions metaphors with the care of an artist where the discerning can readily watch the sacramental white flowerings parallel the blankness of her sorrow and a foundering death wish. 
Simple and poignant scholars have regarded The Widow's Lament in Springtime as: 
* "A white that rouses the desire to merge with it and get lost in it is experienced as an extreme: Oppositions fuse, ecstasy leads to oblivion and annihilation, the color of joy turns - as in China - into the color of mourning." Peter Halter 
* "'(c)rowds are white,' the sea is dark: immersion in either gives relief, a union with One, but halts the cyclic process of renewal." James E. Breslin 
* "White is a symbol of a world from which all colors as material attributes have disappeared. The world is too far above us for its structure to touch our souls. There comes a great silence which materially represented is like a cold, indestructible wall going on into the infinite. White, therefore, acts upon our psyche as a great, absolute silence, like the pauses in music that temporarily break the melody.... White has the appeal of nothingness that is before birth" Wassily Kandinsky 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A noder whispered: Thanks for noding the "Sour Grapes" stuff. I sometimes wonder what a life without tears would be like but it only makes me sad....curses to WCW for making me sob with the widow.

Blueflags 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
Blueflags 
I stopped the car 
to let the children down 
where the streets end 
in the sun 
at the marsh edge 
and the reeds begin 
and there are small houses 
facing the reeds 
and the blue mist in the distance 
with grapevine trellises 
with grape clusters 
small as strawberries 
on the vines 
and ditches 
running springwater 
that continue the gutters 
with willows over them. 
The reeds begin 
like water at a shore 
their pointed petals waving 
dark green and light. 
But blueflags are blossoming 
in the reeds 
which the children pluck 
chattering in the reeds 
high over their heads 
which they part 
with bare arms to appear 
with fists of flowers 
till in the air 
there comes the smell 
of calmus 
from wet, gummy stalks.

Spouts 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
Spouts
In this world of 
as fine a pair of breasts 
as ever I saw 
the fountain in 
Madison Square 
spouts up of water 
a white tree 
that dies and lives 
as the rocking water 
in the basin 
turns from the stonerim 
back upon the jet 
and rising there 
reflectively drops down again. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
William Carlos Williams was an original and truly American voice and he was familiar with the works of Picasso, Gris, Picabia, Braque, and Cezanne. He strived to do in his poems what these artists were doing with their paintings and sculpture, to lift "to the imagination those things that lie under the direct scrutiny of the senses, close to the nose." 
By using theories that originated from painting he isolated words to transform them into art objects. Marjorie Perloff a foremost critic of twentieth-century poetry relates: 
"Here was a man who had a kind of energy, sexual energy, that he didn't know quite how to channel. One of the main tensions that I see in Williams' work is between that sexual energy and desire and fear and safety......Williams' great taste for the new, almost the cult of the new some would say, is intimately bound up with his feeling about America as the New World and with his feeling that the poet's mission is to celebrate the New World and with his feeling about birth and with his being a pediatrician and bringing babies into the world so that he's always dealing with the new. When you are a pediatrician and you're constantly dealing with birth, it cannot be a coincidence that that's what Williams did professionally and that is what is so much the subject of his poetry." 
The beauty of ordinary things is what William Carlos Williams made every effort to convey with his images of words. Spouts is from his collection Sour Grapes: A Book of Poems (1921). At 24 years old Williams was an intern at the Nursery and Children's Hospital in New York's Hell's Kitchen, a neighborhood best known for its dangerous criminals and drug addicts. Perhaps an artistically sculptured water fountain of Madison Square was a refreshing and embracing sight at the end of a long day of delivering babies. No doubt he had observed time and again the earthly and sensual nurturing of a mother suckling her child; here Williams has likened a water fountain perched upon the comforting bosom of a thriving city known as New york as he explores the sensual experience of the female body with a deep desire for maternal sanctuary and nourishment.

The Nightingales 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
The Nightingales 
My shoes as I lean 
unlacing them 
stand out upon 
flat worsted flowers 
under my feet. 
Nimbly the shadows 
of my fingers play 
unlacing 
over shoes and flowers. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is another poem from William Carlos Williams Sour Grapes (1921) collection. It's a tiny love poem; certainly he has written some of the best love poems of the twentieth century. Always something with him, a sly hint or clever innuendo one can well imagine that he is standing upon a flowered rug with marvelous shadows of his fingers as nightingales, amusingly engaged as paramours dancing over his shoes as he loosens them. A nightingale of course is noted for his sweet nocturnal song. Nimble, in a hurry to unlace his surely high-tops, he's adept, witty and full of play, noticing things. What a charming lover!

The Birds 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
The Birds 
The world begins again! 
Not wholly insufflated 
the blackbirds in the rain 
upon the dead topbranches 
of the living tree, 
stuck fast to the low clouds, 
notate the dawn. 
Their shrill cries sound 
announcing appetite 
and drop among the bending roses 
and the dripping grass.

The Tulip Bed 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
The Tulip Bed 
The May sun--whom 
all things imitate-- 
that glues small leaves to 
the wooden trees 
shone from the sky 
through bluegauze clouds 
upon the ground. 
Under the leafy trees 
where the suburban streets 
lay crossed, 
with houses on each corner, 
tangled shadows had begun 
to join 
the roadway and the lawns. 
With excellent precision 
the tulip bed 
inside the iron fence 
upreared its gaudy 
yellow, white and red, 
rimmed round with grass, 
reposedly.

The Disputants 
Sour Grapes (1921)byWilliam Carlos Williams 
The Disputants 
Upon the table in their bowl in violent disarray of yellow sprays, green spikes of leaves, red pointed petals and curled heads of blue and white among the litter of the forks and crumbs and plates the flowers remain composed. Coolly their colloquy continues above the coffee and loud talk grown frail as vaudeville.

We have all seized the white perimeter as our own and reached for a pen if only to show we did not just laze in an armchair turning pages… - Billy Collins
 Welcome to the perimeter one of the newest poetry and etymology sources on the web. The goal is to create a user-friendly compilation that encourages browsing articles that spans many works by poets covering thousands of years. The site itself is inspired by a poem entitled Marginalia by US Poet Laureate Billy Collins. The spirit arises from its capacity to make a personal connection readers with numerous allusions, a favorite being, "We have all seized the white perimeter..." I have written a few poems but mostly enjoy reading them, taking a look behind the scenes at what motivated the poet and what ignites the poem's popularity. Why does this site exist? That is a surprisingly hard question to answer. It started in the fall of 1999 at Everything2, grew into a pastime (a certain spouse would surely say fixation), and may one day be a significant resource for those who take pleasure in or study poetry.
