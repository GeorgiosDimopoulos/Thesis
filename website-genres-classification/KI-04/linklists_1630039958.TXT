Early Music Files & Links

 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

"Early Music" is generally considered to be music written in the Baroque period or earlier (i.e., about 1750 or earlier). There are enough sites which specialize in topics related to music of the Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods to warrant a dedicated page of links, though it should be remembered that sites listed on other link pages, especially commercial sites, also have significant amounts of information pertinent to early music as well.
