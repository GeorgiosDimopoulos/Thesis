 The best in contemporary designed furniture and home accessories at exceptionally good prices. 
 
Our new Spring collection has just been launched featuring a great new range of fantastically well-priced sofas and furniture designed by and exclusive to Dwell  
We have five new sofa styles starting from only £395: the sleek oatmeal corner sofa with steel legs; the elegantly styled, crisp minimal lines of the two-seater angle sofa; the ultra-contemporary relax sofa with its distinctive laidback look that is perfect for a designer loft; the modern metro sofa - perfect for almost any type of home and finally the leather sofa featuring a great contemporary look at an excellent price 

In the dining room, we have a great range of new options. The round dining table with tapered legs comes in a light oak or dark oak. Sideboards start from £125, with our favourite being the frosted glass sideboard at only £195 for an amazingly expensive looking piece. 

As ever, chairs are one of our real strengths. We now have an upholstered oak chair with faux suede cover and a similar chair in real leather. We also have a full oak veneer chair with a beautifully minimal line and sweeping back. 

The new range includes a collection of incredibly well priced clear solid glass tables. A set of 3 nesting side tables in chunky solid clear glass is only £129, a price you could expect to triple at other stores. For an incredible centre piece, look no further than the mobile glass coffee table, a huge sweeping single sheet of thick folded glass. 

For those finishing touches, we have some great new accessories including shaggy cushions, faux suede curtains and slate placemats. 

All of our range, including sofas and furniture, is held in stock so you can get nationwide delivery in under a week (2 weeks for larger items delivered outside of London).
