 

Moderated Newsgroups FAQ

This is for people who know a little about Usenet and other Internet
    newsgroups, and who want to know more about moderated newsgroups.

If a proposal has been made to moderate one of the newsgroups you
    read, this FAQ should help clarify what moderation might bring.

If you are considering volunteering to help moderate a newsgroup,
    you should read this FAQ and most of the things it points to.

If you want to learn more about the process of creating or changing
    newsgroups, or to be the proponent for creating a new group or for
    changing the status of an existing group, see the FAQ section below.

This document is periodically posted to Internet newsgroups as:

Section 1 - Moderation in a nutshell

------------------------------ 

Subject: Q1.1 What is a moderated newsgroup and how does it work?

In unmoderated newsgroups, the local news server software normally
    makes messages posted to the newsgroup available for reading soon
    after they are posted, and the messages then spread to other news
    servers over the next few days.

In a moderated newsgroup, the local news server software
    will automatically e-mail the message to a moderation address,
    where a moderator acts as a gatekeeper, posting to the newsgroup
    only those messages which the moderator allows to be posted.

The basis of moderation is the consent of the users of the group,
    in Usenet, by the vote on the charter and moderator(s).

In the 8 Usenet news hierarchies (comp, rec, soc, sci, misc, news,
    talk, & humanities) a moderated newsgroup is created by the same
    RFD/CFV (RFD: Request for Discussion, CFV: Call for Votes)
    process used to create or modify other newsgroups, with the
    difference that the RFD and CFV will include language specifying
    moderator(s) and moderation policy.  (See the Guidelines)

Non-Usenet news hierarchies (alt.*, <national>.*, <local>.*)
    may have other rules (or no rules) for group creation and change.
    Look in their groups - usually *.config or *.general - for FAQs.

All moderated groups are generally handled in the same way by
    local news server software, regardless of their news hierarchy.

Moderation is usually proposed for a newsgroup to:

decrease the volume of off-topic posts and/or cross-posted threads

increase the significant on-topic content of posts

and thus increase the "signal-to-noise" (S/N) ratio for the group.
    For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see:

Newsgroups: news.lists,news.groups,news.answers
        Subject: List of Moderators for Usenet

There are 280+ moderated groups in the 8 Usenet hierarchies,
    mostly in comp., soc., sci., and rec.; and about 80+ in alt.*.

Some parallel models for moderation are:

a refereed scientific journal

a publication with a small subscriber base and an unpaid editor

a restaurant with a polite but determined doorman

Note that while the moderator controls the day-to-day content
    of a single medium - newsgroup, mailing list, journal, etc. -
    the moderator does not control the entire topic area.

For instance, the readers could migrate to a related newsgroup
    or mailing list, and discuss the topic area there.

Also note that when we say the moderator "approves" a message,
    we just mean that the moderator allows the message to be posted
    to the moderated newsgroup, and not that the moderator agrees
    (or disagrees) with the content of the message, or the position
    of the poster on any issue, and so forth.

------------------------------

Subject: Q1.2 What happens to articles in a moderated newsgroup?

When someone tries to post a news article to a moderated group,
    the local news server software automatically intercepts the post,
    and e-mails it to a moderation address for processing by the moderator.

If the local news software cannot handle this, the poster could
    manually e-mail the article to the moderation address directly.

Once the message reaches the moderation address, it may be handled
    by a human moderator, or forwarded to one of a panel of moderators,
    or filtered by some form of moderation software.

If a message is approved and posted by a moderator, it appears on the
    moderator's news server and then spreads to other news servers.

Note that newsgroup moderation has some similarities to mailing
    list operation - messages go to a hub, and are then redistributed.

An attempt to cross-post a message to a moderated group and to other
    newsgroups will go to the moderation address for the moderated
    group, and will not show up in any of the other groups on the local
    server unless and until the moderator approves it as a cross-post.

An attempt to cross-post a message to more than one moderated group
    will go to the moderation address for one group, in most cases,
    the moderated group that appears first on the Newsgroups: line,
    and will be handled further as that moderator chooses.

Each moderated newsgroup is operated independently from other
    moderated newsgroups, and the procedure used by each moderator
    to handle messages is probably unique to that news group,
    although some techniques are in common use by many moderators.

Some common techniques include:

a moderation address different from the moderator's personal mailbox

some scripts or programs to aid in manually handling messages

some automatic ("robotic") process for handling messages

a way to distribute messages to one or more of a panel of moderators

Many of the earliest moderated newsgroups existed to distribute
    free or shareware software sources, so early moderators tended to be
    fairly astute about the workings of e-mail and net news, and capable
    of writing their own software to support moderation.

More recently, as moderation has been adopted in less technical groups,
    moderators have tended to be well aware of the topic they plan to
    moderate, but less prepared to cope with the technical side of
    moderation, and are likely to recruit someone to help them with
    technical support of whatever scripts and programs they need.

Moderated groups frequently have names that end in .announce,
    .moderated, .info, .answers, .research, or .reviews.  Recently
    there has been a trend to create moderated alternatives to existing
    high-volume groups, so foo.bar.moderated joins an existing foo.bar.
    The .announce and .answers groups tend to contain only announcements
    or FAQs, while .info groups tend to have both of those.
    Moderated groups in sci.* and soc.* tend to be discussion groups,
    while in comp.* and rec.* they tend to be announcement groups.

Section 2 - Frequently Answered Questions

------------------------------ 

Subject: Q2.1 So where did my message go?

If you tried to post a message to a moderated group, and never saw
    it appear in the newsgroup on your news server, realize that it may
    have not been approved by the moderator as appropriate for the group.

Also, e-mail, net news, and robo-mod software are imperfect, and
    human moderators are, after all, human.  Your message may have
    failed to reach the moderator, or been lost in a system or disk
    crash, or been misplaced by the moderator, or been approved and
    then failed to propagate correctly via net news back to your site.

You might want to look carefully at the Date: headers in recent
    messages in the moderated newsgroup, to see if other posts are being
    approved, and to get a sense of the usual turnaround time.
    Perhaps the moderator is busy with life, and approvals are either
    slow in coming, or are coming in batches.  You might check another
    news server, or Deja News at http://www.dejanews.com/

If, after you've waited a few days, and seen other articles approved
    that were probably submitted as the same time as yours, and you are
    sure that what you had to say is on-topic, on-charter, and is still
    important, you should probably send your message again, perhaps with
    a request for an acknowledgement.  Newsgroup charters and moderator's
    policies will vary from group to group, and you should not expect
    a rejection note for every article that is not approved, especially
    if the article is off-topic or inappropriately cross-posted.

------------------------------

Subject: Q2.2 What are some possible problems for moderated groups?

Since messages are sent to a single moderation address, anything
    relying on that address is a possible single point of failure for
    the moderation process.  However, most types of system failure are
    shortlived, and operation of the group can resume rapidly.

Another possible problem is that the moderator will "burn out"
    - get exhausted from dealing with the volume of messages, questions,
    complaints, arguments, etc., etc.  Having multiple moderators or
    being able to hand off the responsibility to a substitute can help.

If the people posting to the newsgroup and relying on the moderator
    remember to be reasonable and courteous that can help a lot as well.

------------------------------

Subject: Q2.3 Moderation seems like a lot of work - is it worth it?

A lot of readers think it is worth it, and some moderators agree. :-)

Since 1995 many proposals have been made to moderate previously
    unmoderated groups in the wake of increased volume of both on-topic
    and off-topic posts, widely cross-posted trolls, and a general
    perception that the signal-to-noise ratio of Usenet has been dropping.

If you are a reader who wants to help the moderator of a group,
    volunteer to help - even if the moderation process is going just
    fine right now, your help might be useful later or in other areas.

Other activities that can help add value to a newsgroup include:

periodic posting of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) files

archive site(s) accessible by ftp, http, and/or e-mail, of:

FAQ files

other summaries or indexes of the topic or of old threads

full text of old posts (perhaps threaded into hypertext)

a gateway to/from a mailing list for people
            who can not (or will not) read Usenet posts.

a digest and/or index mailing list

technical support of (robo-)moderation for the moderator

------------------------------

Subject: Q2.4 What is robo-moderation?

Robotic moderation, robo-mod, auto-mod, and using a mod-bot
    all refer to use of scripts or programs to process messages.

Typically, messages arriving at the moderation address are examined
    to see if they fit criteria determined by the moderator, and if they
    do they are automatically approved and posted to the newsgroup.

Messages which do not fit the criteria may be manually approved, or
    discarded as inappropriate for that newsgroup, or handled in some
    other way by the moderator, which may include changes to the criteria.

For example, if a message arrives from a previously unknown poster
    (or e-mail address), the moderator may read the message and approve
    it, send the new poster a copy of the FAQ for the newsgroup,
    and add the poster's address to a list of pre-approved posters,
    so the poster's next message will be automatically approved.

Or, the moderator might reject the message (as for a too-common FAQ),
    send the poster a copy of the FAQ file, and expect that the
    prospective poster's next message is more appropriate for approval.

Commonly used robo-mod criteria might include:

message is not a duplicate of a recent message

message has new material in good proportion to quoted material

message is from a known poster who can be expected to post well

message contains words or phrases
        particular to the topic of the newsgroup.

negative criteria might include:

message is inappropriately cross-posted

message is from unknown poster

message contains words or phrases
        that trigger review by human moderator
        ("make money fast," "modem tax," "good times virus")

For an example of a feature-laden and very security-conscious
    robo-moderation package, see:

Subject: Q2.5 Where can I learn more about the newsgroup creation process?

Introductory messages about Usenet in general are periodically posted
    to the newsgroup news:news.announce.newusers

Messages describing the newsgroup changing process are posted
    several times a month with "How to" in the Subject: line to the
    newsgroup news:news.announce.newgroups

To learn how Usenet newsgroups are created or changed through the
    RFD/CFV process (RFD: Request for Discussion, CFV: Call for Votes)
    look for these articles which describe the process in detail:

Subject: How to Create a New Usenet Newsgroup

(subtitled:  Guidelines for Usenet Group Creation
            and often referred to as the Guidelines.)

Subject: How to Write a Good Newsgroup Proposal
 Subject: How to Format and Submit a New Group Proposal

Before proposing that a new Usenet newsgroup be created, you should
    first follow at least one newsgroup proposal debate from RFD to
    RESULT in news.groups, and follow and become familiar with the
    topics and readership of the 5 to 10 newsgroups or mailing lists
    most closely related to the topic.

The Guidelines and other introductory articles are also available by
    anonymous FTP or with many Web browsers in one or more of:

ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.announce.newgroups/
 ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.announce.newusers/
 ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.groups/

Look for filenames which are the Subject: lines
    with spaces replaced by underlines, thus:

How_to_Create_a_New_Usenet_Newsgroup

Or you can get them by e-mail by sending e-mail thus:

To: mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

send usenet/news.groups/How_to_Create_a_New_Usenet_Newsgroup

For help on the MIT mail-server, send e-mail thus:

------------------------------

Subject: Q2.6 How about more on Usenet, moderation, robo-moderation, etc.?

If your only access to information about Usenet is Usenet itself,
    then you should look in the newsgroup news:news.answers or in the
    other *.answers newsgroups and search for Subject: lines that
    contain key words for the topic you are interested in.  Or, if you
    know which newsgroups handle that topic, look in those newsgroups
    for FAQ or "Frequent".

If you have access to a World Wide Web browser, or to
    anonymous FTP, you can use the http or ftp URLs below.

There are other Usenet documents available at one of several archives:

ftp://ftp.uu.net/usenet/
 ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/

Section 3 - Frequently *Argued* Questions

------------------------------ 

Subject: Q3.1 Are there any alternatives to moderation?

This question is usually asked in response to proposals to moderate
    existing high-traffic newsgroups, in hope of avoiding moderation.

Posters could use more descriptive Subject: lines, and change
    Subject: lines in their followups to better describe a changing
    subject, or use tags or keywords in Subject: lines, but this is
    usually more effective in a low-volume newsgroup with a strong
    sense of community, and less effective in higher-volume newsgroups
    that have a greater proportion of new posters, or of people who
    can not or will not change subject lines, or for people who use news
    software that ignores the References: header, and thus find it harder
    to follow discussion threads across a change in Subject:.

------------------------------

Subject: Q3.2 Will a moderated group have slower propagation of messages?

Like many things on the net, that depends.  Specifically, it depends
    on the connectivity of the poster's site, the moderator's site, and
    each individual reader's site, and on whether everything is working
    normally and well among those sites.

In general, hand-moderated newsgroups often have some unavoidable
    delay, while robo-moderated groups often have fast turnaround.

If we assume that:

a message travels faster by e-mail than by news
        from the poster's site to the moderation site

the moderator's site is well-connected (for mail and news)

the poster's site is less well-connected (for news)

the moderation process incurs little delay (such as if it
        is a program set up to recognize messages from known posters)

then a moderated group *might* provide faster propagation
    for that message than an unmoderated group.

On the other hand, if a moderation address is at a poorly connected
    site, and the poster is at a well connected site, or if there is a
    delay of significant length at the moderation address, then the
    moderated newsgroup might have a greater lag and thus a slower pace.

On the other other hand, readers of a group might prefer a slower
    paced newsgroup over a rapid-response group.  In any case,
    anyone who volunteers to moderate a newsgroup should plan
    to work to reduce delay in the moderation process.

------------------------------

Subject: Q3.3 How does moderation differ from censorship?

People have been arguing this issue since moderation was first
    proposed as a mechanism for Usenet newsgroups around 1980.  Some
    people see no difference between the two, some see moderation as
    good and censorship as evil, and other points of view abound.

Before continuing, go find a dictionary, and look up "censorship."
    While you're at it, look up "editor" and "referee."

To me, one way to view this issue is that while someone may want to
    post their messages to an audience, that audience may have chosen
    to have a moderator select which messages they will see, and thus
    the desire of an individual to post a message is outweighed by
    the desire of a multitude to have messages moderated.

An analogy to moderation is that of a publication whose editor is
    paid by the publisher and (indirectly) by the subscribers to decide
    what to print and what not to print.  Is the editor a censor?

How about the newspaper that puts all the sports stories in one
    section, all the local news in another, and keeps the classified
    ads classified separately from the news and editorials.
    Is that organization by topic, or is it censorship?

Another key difference is that censorship usually tries to
    disallow expression of certain views or topics in *all* media,
    while Usenet moderated newsgroups only disallow postings in
    one medium - a single newsgroup whose audience has agreed
    to a charter that often describes what is on or off-topic,
    and to a moderator and to the process of moderation.

An extension of that view is that if there is some newsgroup
    in which an individual can post a message and be on-topic,
    then that individual and that message have not been censored.

Since most newsgroups are not moderated, almost all moderated
    newsgroups will be topically related to some unmoderated newsgroup
    in which a post would be both on-topic and not subject to moderation.

The discussion of differences between moderation and censorship has
    been erupting several times a year in news.groups for about 15 years.
    If you raise the topic again, try to bring some new material to discuss.
    I have tried to present a fair distinction, but freely agree that I
    usually support moderation of newsgroups.

------------------------------

Subject: Q3.4 How are changes made to a moderated group?

Changes to the moderation panel and to moderation criteria, scheme,
    procedure, or process are often carried out by the moderator(s)
    with the informal or tacit approval of the readership.

A newsgroup could conduct its own votes on proposals for changes.

Groups with a panel of moderators often have a procedure for
    replacing a retiring moderator, or for firing one of the panel.

If the only or last remaining moderator wishes to resign, s/he might
    ask for volunteers, and either select one or more new moderators, or
    perhaps poll the users of the group on their preferences.

If no volunteer is acceptable to the group, or, as has happened
    in a few cases, a moderator has vanished from the net without
    warning or explanation, the moderated newsgroup may be left silent.

Few moderators have seemed to vanish, and there seems to be no
    accepted method to replace a moderator who cannot be found,
    although the RFD process seems like a reasonable approach.

------------------------------

Subject: Q3.5 Could changes be forced upon a moderated group?

The RFD/CFV process could be used to change the status of a group,
    including:

to create a new group - moderated or unmoderated
        to moderate an unmoderated group
        to unmoderate a moderated group
        to re-organize a set of groups
        to replace a retired moderator, or one who has vanished

but note that any RFD/CFV process would require:

a minimum of 2 months
        a lot of work on the part of the RFD/CFV proponent
        possibly a new moderator (or panel of moderators)
        a (possibly contentious) discussion on the proposal

There is no method currently available on Usenet to remove
    or replace a moderator who actively opposes replacement.

The moderator of news.announce.newgroups is not likely to post
    a proposal for removing a moderator as long as he or she continues
    to give some sort of service to the newsgroup's readership.

The closest alternative is to use a different newsgroup,
    or to propose creation of one with the RFD/CFV process,
    which requires a 2:1, 100+ margin.  (See the Usenet Guidelines)

Subject: Q3.6 Can moderation be accomplished retro-actively?

To most people, newsgroup moderation means the process of
    filtering and approval-before-posting described above.

Cancellation of messages by a third party - someone other than the
    poster or the poster's system administrator - after the message
    has been posted is sometimes referred to as retroactive moderation.

Some on-line services and Fidonet use cancellations issued by
    service employees or by Fido sysops as a way of keeping discussion
    in their conference areas by their subscribers on-topic.

While cancellation and moderation may seem superficially similar,
    there are strong sentiments in Usenet against third party cancellation.

The net news protocols allow the sending of control messages,
    messages which contain instructions for news servers, usually to
    cancel or supersede other messages.  This allows people to cancel
    messages sent by mistake, or sent in error to the wrong newsgroups,
    or to cancel a "for sale" ad after the item has been sold.

The effect of cancel messages depends on how each individual news
    server site is configured - a site may honor or ignore a control
    message, or send a message on to a human for manual handling.

Cancellation of messages is a touchy subject, because cancellation
    can be abused, and because it can be difficult to distinguish why a
    message was cancelled - was it because a message was posted to many
    groups, or because of who posted it, or because of the content of
    the message?

It is generally accepted that people may cancel their own messages,
    and that ISPs or system administrators may cancel messages which
    originated at their site and which are inappropriate for some reason.

It is generally accepted that a moderator may cancel messages
    posted with forged approval to a newsgroup s/he moderates.

It is less accepted that a moderator may also cancel messages
    that the moderator (or a mod-bot) initially approved and posted,
    if the moderator later finds the message inappropriate for some reason.

Since 1995, a number of people routinely issue cancel messages
    for messages excessively cross-posted or multiply posted to large
    numbers of newsgroups.  (Such posts often are called "spam".)

Cancellation based on the number of newsgroups an article is
    cross-posted or multi-posted to, or of binary posts in non-binary
    newsgroups, or of commercial advertisements in non-commercial newsgroups
    are often widely accepted as beneficial to the affected newsgroups.

However, there is less agreement about cancellation based on content
    - such as whether a message is on-topic or off-topic for a newsgroup,
    a decision which is usually much more of an opinion or judgement.

A key issue here is whether cancels are supported by the wide
    majority of the users of a newsgroup, and are issued by people who
    have the support of such a majority.  If there is a sense of wide
    community support, retroactive cancellation could be effective in
    fostering on-topic communication in an UNmoderated group.

However, use of retroactive content based cancels without wide
    support can often lead to meta-discussions about the cancels,
    which be worse for the signal/noise ratio than the cancelled posts.

So, while newsgroup moderation and retroactive cancellation both
    rely on people making decisions about the content of newsgroups, the
    key elements that they should share are wide support, prior consent,
    an expectation of predictability, and a degree of accountability,
    and the key differences are that moderated groups are formally set
    up with a central moderation address, while groups that rely on
    retroactive cancellation are usually otherwise unmoderated.

 http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~tskirvin/home/cancel.html The Cancel FAQ

If you are thinking of cancelling other people's news articles,
    *for any reason*, you should check your internet provider's policies
    or "terms of service" first, or contact their support staff to see
    if they allow this activity, and to make them aware of your plans.

Section 4 - What does it take to become a moderator?

------------------------------ 

Subject: Q4.1 What is the absolute minimum needed to act as a moderator?

connectivity, hardware, software, capability, time, and effort

connectivity - an account with reliable mail delivery and news access

hardware - a computer and a modem

software - for connectivity, e-mail, and news

capability -

enough technical know-how to configure the software

a working knowledge of mail and news RFCs
                (RFC 822, MIME RFCs, RFC 1036, son-of-1036, GNKS)

the ability and access to edit or insert most of the headers
                on outgoing news messages

------------------------------

Subject: Q4.2 Can one act as a moderator: from a PC? off-line? over POP?
 over PPP/SLIP? without a shell account? without knowing Unix? 

Again, like many things on the net, the answer to all of these
    questions is: "Yes, but it depends."

A moderated *discussion* group that expects fast (< 1 hour)
    turn-around for messages will have requirements different from
    moderated announcement groups that generally have no need for
    turnaround faster than 24-48 hours.

At least one (low-volume) group is moderated from a laptop,
    under MS-Windows, with e-mail software downloaded from the net.

Most moderators probably operate from a Unix host,
    but there is no requirement that they do so.

------------------------------

Subject: Q4.3 What resources do most active moderators have?

At the current state of the art of net news, a typical
    setup for doing moderation would include, either on the
    part of the moderator or the tech support person:

familiarity with the topic and with the Usenet community

several hours of spare time per week for at least a year

an account with a well connected robust site
            (ISP, company, university)

good relations with the system administrator of that site
            (awareness, permission, and any mail aliases needed)
            (ISPs may charge for hosting moderated groups or mailing lists)

experience with two or more mail and news programs
            (e.g., Elm/Pine/Mush, procmail/formail, trn)

familiarity with two or more scripting languages
            (e.g., Perl, Bourne/Korn/Bash shell, awk)

------------------------------

Subject: Q4.4 What software tools are useful for moderation?

An e-mail user agent that can:

handle whatever volume of mail you expect

sort, select, and filter incoming messages

send selected messages to other programs,
        or save them in a readable file format.

A news posting agent that can:

produce RFC 1036 compliant news articles

accept messages from other programs,
        or read them from an e-mail file format.

insert and delete message headers

do other header mangling as needed

------------------------------

Subject: Q4.5 Is knowing Unix optional? Does it help to know Unix?

Yes and yes.

Most of the tools to assist in moderation are available in a Unix
    environment, and if you plan to use a variety of scripts and
    programs to support the moderation process, you may want to use a
    Unix "shell" account to handle the moderation mail rather than a
    dialup IP (PPP, SLIP) account.

On the other hand, if you have the tools to handle a volume of mail,
    posting news, and some scripting in a non-Unix environment, go for it.

If you are comfortable with the Unix environment, and
    you have been thinking of setting up your own home Unix box,
    and you have a reliable mail/news connection, go for it.

The key word is *reliable* - group readers may accept a small loss
    of messages, but a loss of more than a few percent between the
    net and your moderation process would likely be seen as unacceptable.

------------------------------

Subject: Q4.6 What moderation tools are available in non-Unix environments?

# example set-ups wanted for DOS, Windows 3.1*,95,NT, Mac, OS/2, VMS, others.

------------------------------

Subject: Q4.7 Can you moderate from an on-line service? (AOL, CIS, etc.)

I have not found anyone who does among 300 or so moderated groups.

To act as a moderator, you will need to have write access to most of
    the headers on outgoing news messages - and most on-line services
    will not allow a normal user to mangle those headers.

If it were possible to access those headers, there are other issues:

You would probably want to down-load all prospective messages,
    process them off-line, and then upload the resulting approved news
    postings and any e-mail responses (FAQs, rejections, etc.)

If you want a short delay, and a short message turnaround time,
    you would be faced with repeating that process 4-6 times per day.

Doing that in a menu-based environment could become tiresome quickly,

I would not say it is impossible to act as an effective moderator in
    that sort of environment, but I would not try it.  I think it would
    very likely be easier in a less structured environment - such as a
    shell account.  Contrasting reports from anyone moderating an active
    newsgroup from an online service are welcome.
