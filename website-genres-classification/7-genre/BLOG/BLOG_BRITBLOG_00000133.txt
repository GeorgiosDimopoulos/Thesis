Regarding Good and Evil  
Moral relativism is one of the basic enemies of a free and forward-looking society. This blog has been established to recognize that Good and Evil do exist, that they are distinguishable from one another, and that Evil must continually be aggressively confronted and challenged in order to be defeated.

Kate Adamson Supports Terri Schiavo
Posted at davidlimbaugh.com is a story originally reported at LifeSite in support of Terri Schiavo from "vegetative state" survivor Kate Adamson. As a partial excerpt:"This personal testimony confirms what Terri supporters have long suspected?that the execution sought by her husband Michael Schiavo is anything but painless and humane. Furthermore, Kate?s remarkable recovery to nearly full mental and physical health?-she still suffers partial paralysis of her left side?-gives Terri supporters hope that Terri too may still experience a similar recovery, if granted proper care and treatment."I implore you to read the entire article and voice your support and prayers for Terri, and thanks to Kate Adamson, using whatever avenues you have available to you. Please hurry...time is running short!    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 1:05 PM 0 comments

Maryland Democrats Prefer Tax Revenue to Black Spiritual Revenue
The next time a Democrat politician tries to tell you that they are not opposed to the growth of the Christian church, point them to this article, which was mentioned on Hugh Hewitt's blog this morning. Some of the notable quotes from the local politicians for discouraging church growth in Prince George's County, MD?"We don't oppose churches," County Council Chairman Samuel H. Dean (D-Mitchellville) said. "The concern we have is that sometimes churches eat up a lot of land that could be used for other things." (Those other things being projects such as National Harbor, the planned $2 billion hotel, office and entertainment complex along the Potomac River.)"We're losing tax money and retail," council member Camille Exum (D-Seat Pleasant) said. "And increasingly, [churches] are requiring more space." "None of us are against God," Exum said. The county, however, has been willing to use zoning regulations to limit church growth.Even though there are a number of Catholic, Protestant, Muslim and Hindu churches in the area, the article states that "It is the dramatic growth of black Protestant denominations...that has drawn the concern of county officials.""What I hear from residents is that they don't feel like these churches are being an asset to the community," said council member David Harrington (D-Cheverly) who represents Mitchellville.    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 11:23 AM 0 comments               
Does "U.N." Stand for "Underaged Nubiles"?
Michelle Malkin continues to do a stellar job in reporting the ongoing sex scandals that plague the U.N.I've linked to her before on a previous post (Suffer the Little Children) and I encourage everyone to go to her site and get the detailed background on this story. Those who maintain there own blogs should also bring more visibility to this issue.Of all the abhorrent things that are done under the banner of the U.N., the exploitation of women and children is, by far, the worst. Perhaps it's time for the U.S. to seriously consider withdrawing its funding of the U.N., and for the "multilateralist" liberal Democrats to acknowledge that it's the U.S., not the U.N., that represents the best hope for a moral confrontation and victory over evil.    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 7:20 AM 0 comments

Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics (or Beware When You Go To The Polls)
Mucho kudos to Ankle Biting Pundits for exposing another fraudulent, anti-Bush poll (by the AP), this one regarding President Bush's Social Security Plan. They have done previous good work in exposing the fallacy of other poll results here (by the NYT) and here (by the MSM).Please, read these posts in detail to understand how the media can mislead the public by not reporting the characteristics of the data upon which the poll numbers are based. Whether this approach is sinister or just plain sloppy reporting is hard to say. I work with statistical data all of the time, and I'm always reluctant to release any data analysis results without a full, detailed and documented disclosure of how the data was collected, analyzed and interpreted. Without this underlying analysis, there are too many people who are willing to take only the summarized results and spin them to suit their own interpretation and agenda.Regarding poll results, no matter who reports them, you should always investigate to find out the following information, at a minimum:
* Who conducted the poll (and is there any reason to believe they might be biased or have a hidden agenda)
* The number of people participating in the poll
* How the samples are selected (samples must always be selected at random in order for the results to be unbiased - you shouldn't collect data only from angry young men to assess exit polls)
* Where the samples are selected from (selecting all samples randomly from NYC is really not a random sample, given the liberal tendencies of NYC)
* The percent distribution of the sample demographics, which should reasonably reflect the percent distribution of the population demographics in order for the results of the poll to be valid. If they don't reasonably match, then the poll results are biased - find out why! By demographics, I mean things like age, gender, race, Democrat vs. Republican, Liberal vs. Conservative, registered voter vs. unregistered voter, geographic location, income levels, education levels, religion, marital status, etc. 
The casual observer needs to understand that the intentional or unintentional manipulation of any of these demographics will provide poll results that are not representative of the opinions of the population. It's important that bloggers expose lies. It's critical that bloggers expose damn lies. It's imperative that bloggers expose the lies and damn lies that are fed to us through the unscrupulous use and reporting of statistics.

Extremists of a Feather Stick Together
Jihad Watch has posted regarding an offer of "friendship and support" from the white supremacist/anti-Semitic group Aryan Nations to "Al-Qaeda and Sheik Usama Bin Ladin, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and to all Jihadis worldwide". It's nauseatingly ironic how these groups profess to be working towards the "downfall of the anti-life and anti-freedom System prevalent on this earth today."The entire article is posted on the American Daily.Is their anyone who doesn't think that, barring the existence of what they see as their common enemies (i.e., Jews), these people would be cutting each other's throats and blowing each other up? Let's hope for all of our sakes that the world doesn't decline to the point where this theory is put to the test. We've already seen the preliminary match (Hitler vs. Stalin) and nothing good came out of that. At least we've yet to see, as far as I know, any public return of affection from the Islamic extremists for their Nazi friends...yet.    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 11:50 AM 1 comments

Man Plays God. God Judges Man.
Captain's Quarters has opened a posting regarding euthanasia of children and newborns in the Netherlands and in France. The Groningen Protocol apparently codifies the practice in the Netherlands for children up to age 12 years. According to the posting, however:"The problem, according to the AP, isn't limited to the Netherlands. In fact, the French may be the worst offenders, with a whopping 73% of all physicians surveyed have euthanized at least one infant with drug overdoses, the preferred method. That's 30 points higher than the Dutch, which still reports almost half of all physicians have killed newborns. Other countries in Europe report much smaller percentages, between 2-4%."I've previously posted on the need to protect innocent life in "Terri Schiavo's Right to Live or Die", emphasizing that we need to be driven by the belief in the potential for one of God's miracles, and the need to protect innocent life. I sense that Captain Ed and I see eye to eye on this.If you look at some of the comments to his post, however, you see the same elements of moral relativism creeping in that you see in the discussions as to whether Terri Schiavo should be allowed to live or die. At the risk of being labeled a "religious zealot" by one of the commenters, I still feel that the protection of innocent life best represents the moral purpose of humanity, and the real motives behind the termination of innocent life need to be reconciled between the decision makers and the Creator. I do not claim to be in a position to judge what is in the hearts of those who choose to terminate innocent life, either at a personal level or at a societal level. I humbly relinquish that judgment to a Higher Authority.    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 12:17 PM 0 comments

Coming Soon to a Community Near You
This article from the February 24th edition of the Utica (New York) Observer-Disptach describes how the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) has paid for an advertisement that is pasted on the side of one of the City of Utica's public buses.This article is also promoted on the CAIR site, which I will not link to.Some information on their affiliations and activities is reported here, here, here, here, here and here. Regardless of what the official ICNA sites might tell you, you need to become aware of what they don't tell you (and, apparently, what the MSM won't investigate to tell you) .    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 11:59 AM 0 comments

Terri Schiavo's Right to Live or Die
La Shawn Barber has posted a topic at her blog asking for feedback from her readers as to whether or not they believe that Terri Schiavo should be allowed to die. I have posted a couple of comments for this topic at La Shawn's site, under DBN, where much of the discussion has centered around the motives of the husband in having the feeding tubes removed, and the need/desire to protect innocent life.There are 1 or 2 posters, however, who appear to be coming down on the side of moral relativism, i.e., its a difficult situation for everyone, both sides have a point, but the feeding tubes should be removed to alleviate everyone's suffering...Terri's, the parents, Terri's husband, etc. Since my blog is intended to be related to the concept that Good and Evil do exist, I feel that it is imperative that I post on Terri's case and, to the best of my ability, on Terri's behalf.I have no issue with someone who decides, on their own, either proactively or reactively, to not have their life extended by artificial means. I would hope that this decision would not be reached impulsively, that reflection and prayer would guide a person to perceive whether this is God's plan for him/her. A decision as personal as this should only be made with God's divine guidance, for His reasons, that others may or may not ever understand.This process has not been granted to Terri, nor can it be at this stage of her life. Instead, the decision is left in the hands of Terri's husband, whose motives are in question. Indeed, the circumstances under which Terri has ended up in this state also appear to be in question. Moral relativists seem to be ignoring these motives and circumstances, focusing instead on the "big picture" of whether technology should be used to extend the life of someone who will not exist without it.The obvious evil here is whether Terri will be allowed to die based on questionable motives. We "moral absolutists", if you will, still need to be driven by the belief in the potential for one of God's miracles, and the need to protect innocent life.I believe that the more sinister evil of Terri's story, however, lies in the detachment of the moral relativists who refuse to recognize that good and evil do exist. Ending an innocent life for the sake of perceived convenience starts us off on a slippery slope into further justification for abortion and euthanasia. If you don't believe me, just look at how the rules of abortion have changed since Roe v. Wade. Who would have believed in the 1970's that a practice as hideous as "partial-birth abortion" would be "acceptable" policy today. How far away are we from the time when the moral relativists want to euthanize all those who are incapable of caring for themselves. We've seen this happen in history before, haven't we?    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 2:41 PM 0 comments

Another Clinton Foreign Policy Legacy
Chris Field has posted a column over at Human Events Online asking where the Left has been on Nuclear Security now that the MSM is finally beginning to recognize the potential and growing threat posed by China. The test, in part, reads:"The potential nuclear threats against the U.S. from China and other nations are not new, but have developed over several years. Yet somehow the liberal media continue to miss the point that under the not-so-discerning eye of the Clinton White House, and a large portion of the Democratic Party, our nuclear technology was making its way to the bad guys without much apparent hindrance."Click here for the entire article.My take on why the MSM is beginning to report it now is that they will try to blame the Bush administration for the gathering storm. This is the same tactic that they used post-9/11 to blame the Bush administration for not recognizing the terrorist threat, disregarding the "ignorance is bliss" position taken by the Clinton-Gore administration regarding Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda.    # posted by Uncle Dave @ 3:11 PM 0 comments       
About Me
Name:Uncle Dave 
Location:Upstate New York, United States 
I always considered myself apolitical, but opinionated. That started to change during the 2004 election campaign, after hearing the negativity and vitriol coming from the Democratic Party leadership. I've been recently (within the last two weeks) toying with creating a blog that addresses the good and evil associated with US politics and the liberal biases imposed on us. Hearing Howard Dean calling Republicans "evil" motivated me to take this step. I extend my thanks, then, to Howard Dean and the Democratic Party leadership for converting my apolitical disposition into one person's voice for Republican and conservative activism.
