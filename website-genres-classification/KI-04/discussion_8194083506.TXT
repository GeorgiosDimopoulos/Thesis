 Posts: 75	    Boot Problem: Can't get rid of the Windows Multi Boot thing  

Hey, I have windows 2000 installed on my Disk 1, and I also tried Windows XP out on disk 2. I didn't like XP so I deleted the partition it was on using Partition Magic, but the windows dual boot thing still comes up asking me if i want to boot into XP. So I deleted the XP line in the boot.ini file, but it's still coming up with the dual boot thing, for WIndows 2000 or Windows Default. So there must be some other file specifying to use this multi boot thing, and I want to know how to get it back to just booting strait into Win 2K thanks

maybe XP replaced your boot code loader. try "fdisk /mbr" when running w2k on a command line. did this help? (i had the same problem using 2 installations of w2k, but it went away when i completely formatted and fdiskÂ´d my second HD, no partition magic...)

hello Locate the boot.ini file in the root folder of drive C and open the file in Notepad. Remove any entries that no longer point to valid installations. Alternerly you may change the timeout to 0 sec. Ole

Hey Ole, ctb (and me) tried that already. it does not help (read the first post!!!) setting timeout to 0 is just a workaround if you have ONLY one OS running. sadly i have three. now i use LILO for MBR which helps alot already. but does anyone know in which different location MS stores these boot-infos? does ntldr do auto-detection (i guess from watching this behaviour)? greetings, Manuel
