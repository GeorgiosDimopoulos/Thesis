SEARCH WITH SUCCESS WITH SEARCHNZ
 
Welcome to SearchNZ. A fault-tolerant ("fuzzy") search engine, restricted to New Zealand cyberspace and part of the NZCity group of premium web content for New Zealanders. 
SearchNZ allows you to search through the actual text that exists on pages of NZ Web sites, as opposed to a web directory which only lets you search or browse descriptions of submitted sites. 
SearchNZ has a great feature not available on most other Web search engines - it's "fuzzy", allowing you to search on words even if you are unsure of the correct spelling. We recommend you read our search hints to make the most of SearchNZ's superior features.
