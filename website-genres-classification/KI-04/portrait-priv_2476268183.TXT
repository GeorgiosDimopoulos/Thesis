Software 

Some of my statistical parsers are available for research use. Please look at the Brown Computer Science Homepage, under Software Catalog, and then under nlparser. Unfortunately I cannot really support them, so I will almost certainly not respond to e-mails for help unless the problem looks particularly interesting. 

To inspire research into parsing, I thought it might be interesting to publicize a list of sentences on which my parser performs poorly. Look here.

Biographical Material

Eugene Charniak is Professor of Computer Science. and Cognitive Science at Brown University. He received an A.B. degree in Physics from University of Chicago and a Ph.D. from M.I.T. in Computer Science. He has published four books: Computational Semantics, with Yorick Wilks (1976); Artificial Intelligence Programming (now in a second edition) with Chris Riesbeck, Drew McDermott, and James Meehan (1980, 1987); Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Drew McDermott (1985); and Statistical Language Learning (1993). He is a Fellow of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence and was previously a Councilor of the organization. His research has always been in the area of language understanding or technologies which relate to it, such as knowledge representation, reasoning under uncertainty, and learning. Over the last few years he has been interested in statistical techniques for language understanding. His research in this area has included work in the subareas of part-of-speech tagging, probabilistic context-free grammar induction, and, more recently, syntactic disambiguation through word statistics, efficient syntactic parsing, and lexical resource acquisition through statistical means.
