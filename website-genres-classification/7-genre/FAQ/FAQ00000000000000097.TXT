We tried to file electronically and the tax return was rejected because my wife's name did not match her social security number. What should we do?
If the name on her social security card differs from what was provided on the tax return, the electronic transmission will be rejected. This means the return has not been filed. You need to either use the name exactly as shown on her social security card or change her card at the Social Security Administration and allow two weeks before resubmitting your return electronically. 
You can contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213 or visit your local Social Security Administration office and follow their procedures to correct your records. 
For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.

How long after I change my name with social security will I be able to file my tax return electronically?
Generally, two weeks after you change your name with the Social Security Administration, the IRS should have the information and you should be able to file electronically. If you do not have two weeks to wait before the due date for filing your return timely, you will need to file a paper return. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.

My electronic tax return keeps getting rejected for a dependent's social security number used more than once or on another return. I have verified the social security numbers of all my dependents with the Social Security Administration and no one else is authorized to claim our children on their taxes. How do I correct this error so that an e-file return will go through?
Unfortunately, you will need to file a paper return this year. Do not send any documents that are not required with your tax return. Whether the cause of this rejection is the result of a typo on another return or an attempt by another party to claim your dependent, the IRS has security measures in place to ensure the accuracy of returns submitted. In such cases, the IRS will question the dependency exemptions claimed by any other party using the wrong social security number. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.

I have electronically filed my tax return and it has not been accepted because a dependent's social security number and last name do not match the IRS records. I have checked with the Social Security Administration office and the information is correct as it appears on their social security cards. What do I do now?
Unfortunately, you will need to file a paper return this year. Do not send any documents other than the required form. You should also attach documentation supporting the social security numbers in question for the dependents and a copy of the e-file rejection notice. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.

Could you explain the electronic filing error message: Primary social security number was previously used as a dependent's social security number on another tax return?
The social security number in question appeared as a dependent on another tax return for this same year. Whether the cause of this rejection is the result of a typo on another return or an attempt by another party to claim a dependent using your primary social security number, the IRS has security measures in place to ensure the accuracy of returns submitted. In such cases, the IRS will question the dependency exemptions claimed by any other party using the wrong social security number. If you have verified this primary social security number and found no errors, you need to file a correct paper return. You should mail you tax return in and any required forms and schedules but do not attach any additional information; if needed the lRS will contact you by mail for any supporting documentation. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.

Could you explain the electronic filing error message: Dependent's social security number was used as primary and claimed self as an exemption on another tax return?
This message means the social security number for the person whose exemption is being claimed on this tax return as a dependent has already been filed on another tax return as the primary taxpayer claiming the exemption. This may occur when your child has filed his or her own return and not checked the box that someone else can claim him or her as a dependent, or may be the result of a typo on another return. The IRS has security measures in place to ensure the accuracy of returns submitted. In such cases, the IRS will question the exemptions claimed by any other party using the wrong social security number. If you have verified the dependent's social security number and found no errors and your dependent has not filed a return and claimed an exemption, you need to file a correct paper return. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.

I am concerned that someone else may be using my social security number to file taxes without my knowledge and would like to know what to do?
Your concern may be the result of having had your e-file tax return rejected with an error message that your social security number has already been used on another return, for the same tax year. The cause of this rejection might be that someone is using your social security number to file a return, but also might be the result of a typo on another return. The IRS has security measures in place to verify the accuracy of tax returns and validity of social security numbers submitted. If you received this electronic filing error message and you have verified your social security number and have found no errors, you need to file a correct paper return. Send only your tax return and all required forms and schedules; please do not attach any other documents. If necessary, the IRS will contact you by mail for additional information. 
You are entitled to file your return correctly. If, however, you have knowledge of tax fraud being committed, you may make an anonymous report by calling 1-800-829-0433. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.
