I couldn't believe i counted about 24 months since the last time there has been a significant update to my site. The new design is a bit less crowded, and i've removed frames. Not all links are available yet.
Site is currently hosted at ntl.com. Sorry this site isn't fully compatible with Netscape Navigator.
