And It's Goodbye From Him!!  
The time has come to hang up the blogging boots, well on this blog anyway. We just haven't got the time anymore to keep three blogs on the go so we're going back down to one, our first love - Snowbabies!.Thanks to everyone who has left a comment or linked to me over the last nine months, I've added all your links to Snowbabies so I don't miss any of your posts.Time to get the drinks in, mines a pint!Paul (Yorkshire Snowman) Posted by Yorkshire Snowman on Friday, March 25, 2005

If I Had A Brain Cell!  
Not me, the pillock at Barnsley Council or Yorkshire Water or both that decided not to fix a problem with water leaking from cracks in the main road in to town. Preferring instead to leave it for two whole weeks so they could have the road up on one of the busiest days of the year. Whoever it was, I hope they're stuck in the traffic that is now backing up to the motorway! Posted by Yorkshire Snowman on Thursday, March 24, 2005

What, No Camera!  
I've not had my camera with me for the last few days with the chances of snow disappearing now until next winter, however today I wish I'd had it with me.The tiny village I drive through every morning looked beautiful today with the sun shining and the roads lined with daffodils in full bloom. Further down the road I had to stop to wait for Mrs Mallard to make her way very slowly across the road, mumbling to herself, "I bet you wish you'd got your camera with you!"

Crash Nitro Kart  
We bought a couple of new Playstation games over the weekend, Debbie picked Sonic Mega Collection, all the old Sonic games for Mega Drive and Game Gear on one fun packed disc. I picked Crash Nitro Kart, which is Mario Kart but better...hopefully.I've only managed three laps up to date and on the easy setting found that I had to keep breaking to let the others catch up so I could shoot them. I got a bit carried away then and tried the hard setting, as the lights turned green they all pissed off and left me on the start line! Posted by Yorkshire Snowman on Tuesday, March 22, 2005

And It's Goodnight From Him  
No, I'm not going anywhere, not without a struggle anyway! The title of this post is just one of the memorable catch phrases from the classic TV show The Two Ronnies.Ronnie Corbett and Ronnie Barker are back on our screens tonight with The Two Ronnies Sketchbook on BBC1 at 9pm and I for one am really looking forward to some top quality Friday night entertainment.In my personal opinion, the best sketch they ever did was the fantastic play on words in the hardware shop, with poor old Corbett being given the run around by Barker asking for, amongst other things, fork handles (four candles) and the look on Corbetts face by the end is a picture.Yorkshire Snowman (aka Phantom Raspberry Blower Of Old London Town) Posted by Yorkshire Snowman on Friday, March 18, 2005

Google News  
I've found a cool new feature on Google News today, you can now customize the front page with standard topics like Sport or Entertainment just like many other sites have been offering for some time.The really cool bit though is that you can also add any subject of your choice, for instance, I'm keeping tabs on the latest news on the new Star Wars movie Revenge Of The Sith. All you have to do is add a custom section and enter the search string "Star Wars" and it works like a peach, gathering together all the latest inter-galactic news.I think the force is strong with this one!

Amarillo  
I've just been out and bought the new hit single, Is This The Way To Amarillo, sung by crooner Tony Christie and lip synched by comedian Peter Kay. All in aid of Comic Relief. Bring on the club mix! Posted by Yorkshire Snowman on Thursday, March 17, 2005
