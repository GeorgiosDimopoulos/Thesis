I am maintaining a FAQ list to address specifically programming issues 
(not a general tutorial on Java). Please mail suggested FAQ entries including answer to faqidea-NOSPAM@afu.com. Be sure to leave NOSPAM in the address, it's a zen spamblocker. 
Question with answer gets you a credit in the FAQ.
