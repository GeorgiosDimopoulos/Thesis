D1) How are Atlantic hurricanes ranked?
D2) How are Australian tropical cyclones ranked?
D3) Why do tropical cyclones' winds rotate counter-clockwise (clockwise) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere?
D4) How do I convert from mph to knots (to m/s) and from inches of mercury to mb (to hPa)?
D5) How does the damage that hurricanes cause increase as a function of wind speed?
D6) Why are the strongest winds in a hurricane typically on the right side of the storm?
D7) How much energy does a hurricane release?
D8) What are "concentric eyewall cycles" (or "eyewall replacement cycles") and why do they cause a hurricane's maximum winds to weaken ? New 
D9) What causes each hurricane to have a different maximum wind speed for that given minimum sea-level pressure? New
