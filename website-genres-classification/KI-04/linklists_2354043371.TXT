Encryption and Security-related Resources

The following are security-related resources (aka "the crypto link farm") that I've found on the net. If there's anything which needs updating or correcting, please let me know. Because of its large size, I only update the online version of the page every few months, so please be patient when waiting for updates to reported changes to appear. The complete link farm is around 1/2MB of data, the following links contain the complete collection broken down by topic for ease of access:

Crypto Link Farms
Crypto Archives
Crypto Social Issues
Crypto Software
Miscellaneous Security Items
Public Key Infrastructure
Security Agencies and Organizations
Security Books, Journals, Bibliographies, and Publications
Security People
Security Problems
Security Products
Security Standards, Laws, and Guidelines
