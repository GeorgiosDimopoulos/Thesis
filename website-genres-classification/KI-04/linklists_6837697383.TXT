Bayesian Model Averaging is a technique designed to help account for the uncertainty inherent in the model selection process, something which traditional statistical analysis often neglects. By averaging over many different competing models, BMA incorporates model uncertainty into conclusions about parameters and prediction. BMA has been applied successfully to many statistical model classes including linear regression, generalized linear models, Cox regression models, and discrete graphical models, in all cases improving predictive performance. Details on these applications can be found in the papers below.

Bayesian Model Averaging Software

S-PLUS Software designed by Adrian E. Raftery and/or Chris Volinsky: 

Bayesian Model Averaging for Generalized Linear Models: bic.glm. 
Bayesian Model Averaging for Proportional hazard models: bic.surv 
Bayesian Model Averaging for linear regression: bicreg 
Bayesian Model Averaging for logistic regression: bic.logit 
Bayesian generalized linear modeling and model comparison: glib
(NOTE: if using glib with Splus 6.1 or greater, you will need to install the deprecated function glim first.) 

S-PLUS software designed by Jennifer Hoeting: 

BMA.shar is a collection of programs that perform Bayesian simultaneous variable selection and outlier identification (SVO) via Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition (MC^3). For more info read the README file. 

bma.glm: code for implementing BMA as found in "The Use of Bayesian Model Averaging to better represent uncertainty in ecological models." by Wintle, McCarthy, Volinsky, and Kavanagh, to appear in Conservation Biology. Here is some documentation:

Econometrics Literature

Model combination has been discussed extensively in the econometric literature, usually in the context of combining several experts' forecasts. Bates and Granger (1969) is the forerunner, inspiring a flurry of activity in the field in the early 1970's.
