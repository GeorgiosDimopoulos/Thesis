FROZEN IN KARNAK
On the left is my name (Augustine, not Natalie) in DIY hieroglyphs because I wanted to make sure it's not forgotten. You can do the same with your name at this cool site. Look: I get two birds with one stone plus other useful objects - an arm in the let's-shake-hands position, a pair of shorts (might also be a temple), a straw to sip refreshment, half a pepperoni pizza, three green leaves, a wave of water or pure energy, and three more green thingies (quill pens maybe) to draw with. If you insist on being factual, it's the sounds of the letters that are represented here, not the ideas. See this to learn how to read hieroglyphs and also an excellent book published by the British Museum.

TSUNAMI QUILT CONTRIBUTION
On my buddy/ies Madge/Vitriolica's blog I learned of the Tsunami Quilt Project and of course had to participate in this excellent initiative organised by Marta and Esther. Tomorrow I will send this 6-inch square fabric patch inspired by Luxor's landscape and hieroglyphics. I might include another more abstract one. The deadline for contributions is February 15 so what are you waiting for? Get your scissors out and make some patches to add to what will be glorious proof of worldwide web cooperation and generosity.

A CALECHE RIDE IN LUXOR
I must confess that my drawing hand went AWOL in Egypt and the stockpile of art materials I brought remained neglected in my suitcase. I feel the usual guilt about this but can only offer a lame excuse: everything stunned me beyond words, beyond art, and reproducing what I saw by drawing or painting seemed useless, banal and déja done. However my camera was in constant use, serving as a second pair of eyes and memory- jogger. I am sure that what I absorbed visually and spiritually in Luxor will emerge in some graphic form, whenever it's ready to do so.

NEW YEAR, NEW LOOK
I'm trying this out, inspired by the colours of Egypt and the desire to start afresh. What do you think? I might fiddle around with it some more but there are acres & acres of Luxor pics and words to come and I want to clear the way. Opinions about the new colour scheme please. Meanwhile, here's a first glimpse of my brief encounter with Hatshepsut.

BACK FROM EGYPT, SORT OF
Hi folks, I returned in the small hours of this morning (2 hour delay in Luxor airport) and haven't really hit the ground yet. But I'll try to reassemble myself and post the start of my report in a day or so. It was.....words fail me. Fantastic will do for the moment.
