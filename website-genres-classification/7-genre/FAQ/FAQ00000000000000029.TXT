   Subject: D2) How are Australian tropical cyclones ranked? 
Cyclone Severity Categories - From the Australian Bureau of Meteorology 
An estimate of cyclone severity is now included in all tropical cyclone advices. The table below provides information concerning effects due to wind which are typical of cyclones in the various categories. Remember that the system is not designed to give an exact statement of conditions at individual locations but will give a general idea of the expected worst conditions. Categories of cyclone severity range from " 1 " for weak cyclones to "5" for the most severe cyclones. Accordingly, the risk of property and crop damage, shore erosion and danger to life increases from low for a category 1 to very high for a category 5 cyclone. Using this severity scale, communities will be able to assess the degree of cyclone threat and take appropriate action. It must be emphasised that the category refers to the severity in the zone of maximum winds and therefore the effects felt at individual locations may not be exactly as described in the accompanying table. 
Damage will vary from location to location depending upon factors such as: 
* how far you are from the zone of maximum winds 
* how exposed the location is 
* building standards 
* vegetation type 
* resultant flooding 
It should also be noted that the category does not refer to storm tides; if a storm tide is expected it will be mentioned separately in the cyclone warning. 
Tropical Cyclone Severity 
Categories	 Winds	 Typical effects
 (indicative only)	 
Category 1	 Strongest gust less than 125 km/h	 Negligable house damage. Damage to some crops, trees and caravans. Draft may drag moorings. 	
Category 2	 Strongest gust 125 - 170 km/h	 Minor house damage. Significat damage to signs, trees and caravans. Heavy damage to some crops. Risk of power failure. Small craft may break moorings. 	
Category 3
(eg. Winifred) 	Strongest gust 170 - 225 km/h	 Some roof and structural damage. Some caravans destroyed. Power failure likely. 	
Category 4
 (eg. Tracy) 	Strongest gust 225 - 280 km/h	 Significant roofing loss and structural damage. Many caravans destroyed and blown away. Dangerous airborne debris. Widespread power failure. 	
Category 5
(eg. Orson) 	Strongest gust More than 280 km/h 	Extremely dangerous with widespread destruction.
