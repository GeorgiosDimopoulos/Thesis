Infrequent posting  
I'm afraid Real Life™ has me in a slight tizzy right now. There are work matters, health matters and family matters to be attended to but I think the worst is over.Nothing to worry about and I'm sure I'll have a peeve or two to complain about quite soon! Bear with me.In the meantime, please enjoy The Llama Song. posted by Girly Incognito at 1:46 PM postCount('111089477606036324'); Comments | postCountTB('111089477606036324'); Trackback

Pet peeve #5: But I have the FLU!  
I just stumbled across an article that made me smile.Every time someone tells me they're suffering because they're terribly ill with the flu I want to correct them. Usually they're sniffling a bit and feeling sorry for themselves so they're trying to attract sympathy from all and sundry.Sniffler: "Oh I have the flu *sniff* so I should really be in bed. *sniff sniff*"Girly: "You have a cold. Get some Lemsip and stop being such a baby!"I had the flu once. I couldn't get out of bed or eat or do anything that involved moving. I much prefer to have a cold, at least you get to drink hot booze and claim it's for medicinal purposes. posted by Girly Incognito at 9:04 AM postCount('111044640702725842'); Comments | postCountTB('111044640702725842'); Trackback

Superman, where are you now?  
The latest sign that my job is driving me to insanity:I just found myself bouncing in my seat and typing in rhythm while mouthing along to an old Genesis song.I really hope no-one saw that. posted by Girly Incognito at 2:45 PM postCount('111037968640951713'); Comments | postCountTB('111037968640951713'); Trackback

Pet peeve #4: Life isn't allowed to be OK  
So life is rolling along in a pleasant manner. You have a job you like, a nice place to live, lots of friends and a loving partner. Everything's coming up roses.So you start to complain that your life is average. You even take the opportunity to have a dig at people in a similar situation who can't possibly be really happy because nothing routine can give you a warm, fuzzy glow.Oh honestly, if existance were that futile everyone would kill themselves when they reached their teens and human life would cease to be rather quickly. I for one take pleasure in the minutiae and the routine. It's a question of perspective, some people will never be happy because they won't let themselves.Of course some people won't be happy because they think being miserable makes them more interesting. posted by Girly Incognito at 10:05 PM postCount('111019140043905680'); Comments | postCountTB('111019140043905680'); Trackback

Paranoid Android? Just call me Marvin.  
I've identified a slight problem with being anonymous. I created this blog with the sole purpose of being able to write what I like without fear of recrimination. Sounds good so far... but what happens if I'm too paranoid about identification to say anything interesting about my job or life in general? It's an unlikely prospect but I think I'll have to set myself a few rules about what I can and can't say. As we all know boys and girls, the World Wide Web is a small place when it comes down to it. posted by Girly Incognito at 10:30 PM postCount('111006208264650961'); Comments | postCountTB('111006208264650961'); Trackback

It's in the genes  
Following on from my earlier post about messenger, I called my brother yesterday to see if he was still alive. It's been a couple of months since we spoke and I wanted to see how he was and whether he'd thought about Mothers' Day.Girly: "I haven't seen you online for ages".Brother: "Yeah, I haven't felt like talking to people".Girly: "Why don't you just block the people you don't want to talk to?"Brother: "But I have to go online to do that so they'd see me".Girly: "Ah-ha! No they wouldn't, get the Messenger 7.0 beta and you can log in without anyone seeing you".Brother: "Really? Great!"I guess being anti-social runs in the family. posted by Girly Incognito at 1:20 PM postCount('110985608467215481'); Comments | postCountTB('110985608467215481'); Trackback

Textual camouflage  
I'm currently quite amused by someone I know complaining about the impersonal nature of blogs. The fact that they did so on their blog just makes it funnier. Surely the rise in SMS messaging and online communication shows that many people prefer to hide behind text? I know I do! One of the attractions of the Internet is anonymity, as far as I'm concerned. If you want personal contact make a phone call or visit someone, don't post about your worries and woes in cyberspace and then debate the sincerity of your commenters. posted by Girly Incognito at 2:00 PM postCount('110968569763056144'); Comments | postCountTB('110968569763056144'); Trackback

There once was a girl with a blog,
Who found pleasing her readers a slog,
They moaned and they whined,
'Til her writing declined,
So she launched an anonymous log.
