Hello. I'm an nth-year graduate student in Chemical Engineering at MIT. Since 6 September 2000, n = 3; now that I have completed my departmental seminar, I am at the midpoint of my graduate career, which means I should be focusing on selecting the problems that will form the core of my thesis and start worrying about finding a job in the midst of an economic downturn. In addition, I am also learning far more about theoretical physics and mathematics than is probably healthy for a chemical engineer. [Now that I'm also a DOE fellow, I'll have to add computer science to that list.] For those few brave souls who may actually be interested in knowing what I do for a living (for the moment, at any rate), I now have a research description available for viewing, as my thesis proposal has been submitted. 
In the department, I'm currently involved with the Graduate Advisory Committee, a group which was originally responsible for addressing graduate student concerns to the department's Visiting Committee (an oversight board), and has since evolved into a quasi-permanent committee open to all graduate students who are interested in improving the "quality of life" in the department. 
In my spare time, I've been involved with several choruses, both in and outside of MIT. [Yes, people do have existences outside of their research at MIT.] During the academic year, I sing with either the MIT Chamber Chorus or the MIT Concert Choir, depending on their repertoire and my schedule. This summer I participated in the inaugural season of Senza Misura, a 20-voice chamber chorus, playing in all three groups the challenging yet rewarding role of baritone in tenor II's clothing (a role I have heard described most vividly, and aptly, as ''tenor subwoofer''). [''I'm not a tenor, but I play one on stage. . . .''] 
During Fall 1999, I was a member of both the Chamber Chorus and Concert Choir, singing Britten, Carter, and Purcell with the former, and Mozart, Poulenc, and Verdi with the latter. In Spring 2000, I sang with the Concert Choir, singing Persichetti's Cantata No. 3, Celebrations in March, and Hindemith's Apparebit repentina dies in April, along with Bruckner motets and his Mass in E minor--a once-in-a-lifetime experience, in many ways. For Fall 2000, we'll be singing Bach, Schubert, Bernstein, Copland, and Beethoven. 
More recently, I took part in the premiere of a piece written in memory of John Corley, band director at MIT for many years. The piece, Michael Weinstein's Roman Odes, cannot really be considered a favorite of mine--too many strange and bizarre goings-on, including the music that didn't arrive until three days before the premiere! To give you an idea of the absurdities of the piece, it has spawned not one, but two entries in my MIT Supplement to the Choral Dictionary: check out the entries "Dee-whah?" and "PVC pipe." 
I was an undergraduate at Yale University, from which I graduated in May 1998. I studied Chemical Engineering there, too, along with a wonderful group of conspirators collectively known as YChE : Eric Adelizzi, Jennifer Jackson, Mike Janik, Mai Nguyen, and Jeff Shih. [Don't ask me to expand the acronym--it's not as straightforward as it looks, and I couldn't remember it all if I tried. Ask Mr. Adelizzi if you think you really must know.] 
For those people who mistakenly ended up here instead of my brother's web page, I suggest trying his site at Penn. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here. . . . 
Right now, you can access my curriculum vita, e-mail me, or use my bookmarks (below).

My Bookmarks
The New York Times: Why pay for the newspaper when you can get the same information on-line for free? 
boston.com: A useful guide to the town where the supermarket clerks ask you "Do you have a Stah Cah [Star Card]?" 
Dilbert: How can anybody who's ever had a job in industry not find this funny? 
Encyclopaedia Britannica: Available from college addresses only. 
Project Gutenberg: An enormous collection of literary classics and historical documents (and perhaps also the source of Mr. Adelizzi's nefarious e-mail bombs?). 
For the college- and graduate-school bound: My alma mater offers some excellent resources for prospective graduate students, as well as links for undergraduates. Among the more useful of these are FastWeb, which offers daily updates on new scholarships, and FinAid, which offers more general information on the financial aid process in general.
