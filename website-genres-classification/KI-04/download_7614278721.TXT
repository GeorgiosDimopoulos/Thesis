Downloads and Useful Resources

The NoteTab distribution file is available in two formats from three different locations. The EXE package is the easiest to install. However, some systems don't allow downloading those file types. In that case, download the ZIP package and extract its contents with a utility like Winzip.

There is no trial version for NoteTab Standard, but you can install NoteTab Light to see what it's like.

The ultimate free Notepad replacement and a handy HTML editor. Handle a heap of files with a simple tabbed interface. Search files, strip HTML tags and format text quickly. Build libraries of text macros to speed up your work. Formerly called "Super NoteTab". 100% free -- no ads and no nags.	 

NoteTab Pro 4.95 - Free Trial	 

For those who want the best. NoteTab Pro offers all the features HTML authors, programmers, and other demanding users need to speed up their work. Best of all, it's programmable!
