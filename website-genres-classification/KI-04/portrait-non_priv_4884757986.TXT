This web site is about creating virtual worlds. There is a wealth of information on specific applications and techniques that have been used in different projects. We view the virtual world as a dynamic model of a real or imagined place. It is about behaviors and activity, not just textures, colors, and 3D graphics.
           

You will find references to courses on simulation and virtual world construction, technical papers on various aspects of virtual worlds, and information about the people involved in this endeavor.
     	     	    	    	      
    	    

ModelBenders has established the Simulation First Scholarship at the University of Central Florida.  The scholarship is for students with their BS in Computer Science who are pursuing an MS in Simulation. 	

ModelBenders has also provided a research grant to the Georgia Tech Modeling and Simulation Research and Education Center.
