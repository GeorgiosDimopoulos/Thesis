Research

My main research interests are artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, reasoning under uncertainty, computational logic, diagnosis, probabilistic argumentation systems, reasoning about actions, decision theoretic planning, intelligent agents, and preference elicitation. 

In general, I am interested in the questions: What should an agent do based on its beliefs, abilities and preferences? How can we acquire and efficiently use information to make better decisions? 

I have an online research overview and a list of all of my papers (many are online), talks, and some code to play with. The research overview provides detailed information on Theorist, Probabilistic Reasoning, and Combining logic and probability.
