It's easy, it's fun, it's calculus!

Pretty much every day, Jesse will bless us with some excellence in speech and observation, the kind of which only he is capable. It comes in many forms, really.A brief history of Jesse:-"Oh yeah, man. My dog pissed on my head this weekend."-"My one problem with democracy is that people who are kind of stupid and nasty can, like, breed unchecked."-"That's stupid. It annoys me."

Always a pleasure  
Jeremy, who is finishing out a year-long jaunt in the Town of the Apostle , "eating meat...drinking of the metaphporically omnipresent Spanish wineskin" among other things, in today's letter paints the latest Spanish happenings and pens sentences like these:"However, unknowingly, I had made the most Korean of moves," "she 'knows' Kevin Burke, who reportedly once accused her of looking like an eastern european peasant." And this too-beautiful fragment: "the aforementioned sandwich."I will mention that Kevin Burke also was seen (by myself and others) taking a shallow trek into the dense growth behind the stage upon which both Jeremy and I were playing, to take a leak. posted by gfd at 11:49 AM

scene:  
on my way to Tucker, to read and practice, feeling pleasantly independent, well-clothed for the cold.As I walk into the Daily Grind, there is a guy looking really serious about himself stomping around a small space, close to the brick wall, saying loudly, with a vague northern accent, into his cell "AND 'DEN?" ...AND DEN!? AND DEN!!!!?? in quick, overly energentic bursts, staring down and in front of him with intent eyes. I'm now awakened and a little off-balance. posted by gfd at 1:56 AM   
First off, hot, get serious! aaiiii, here it is  
This thing is my record of major and minor influences and my shapes and phases, by way of experiences and studies at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA.I have been told that the literal translation, and the one I like, of psychomachia is "mind-war." posted by gfd at 1:37 AM
