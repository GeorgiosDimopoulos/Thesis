GAMALIELSSON - 9½ weeks 
Don't trust this man - he is probably insane. 
Welcome to the most meaningless site on the Internet!
This site is developed using braincells and a text editor. And it shows! The layout scores 0 out of 10 at most. So why bother reading this text any further? You should go somewhere else where you can find information about something exciting like "Snowwhite and the seven dwarves" or "Pocahontas". 
This is a complete waste of time. There are no links to any other sites, nothing worth downloading, nothing to buy, nothing to fear and something to drive you crazy. 
Now you can learn something about: 
Furry animals licensed to kill
Lennart Nilsson - ace photographer 
Mockeltorp - a place in space 
Parents 
Brother in arms 
Bad jokes 
Music for the asses 
Sex 
Synthesizers
