The T Hawk Eagle is perfect for the first time RC pilot, yet performs well enough to keep experienced pilots satisfied. 
It's very nippy and gives good flight times (10mins+) It can also handle moderate winds with ease, and is capable of basic aerobatics as well as rolling take-offs, and touch and go's. 
It is extremely tough, and survives the most amazing accidents, sometimes without even a scratch ! In the event you do break something, all the parts are available individually as spares.
The T Hawk Eagle is supplied ARF (Almost Ready to Fly), with the radio and servos already installed. Final assembly takes less than 5 minutes.
The T Hawk Eagle now includes a 12 Volt DC Charger, a spare wing, and a spare fin and tail.
