Parkgate
We spent a lovely afternoon yesterday wandering along the front at Parkgate on the Dee Estuary. Has Spring sprung or what? This picture shows the marshes with the tide out. At winter high tide the water can reach the wall and all the animals that live in the marshes are forced out from the grasses and apparently it is a bit of a birdwatchers paradise with various waders, falcons and even owls having to make a move. Animals of the scurrying variety tend to run up onto the road too which I believe is a bit of a site. More pics here.And why do fish and chips taste 20 times better when you eat them outdoors and it is ever so slightly chilly?Compare this with a picture I found of Parkgate in 1914 by 6ft Wasp at 7:55 PM   | postCount('110711355312876936');

Morons
Time for a Victor Meldrew moment:On the way back from Manchester there was a coach on fire on the M56 (in the opposite direction to us). It looked really bad but was on the hard shoulder and there were no ambulances so I would hope everyone got off in time. There was smoke everywhere and after we went past there was a huge tailback of standing traffic. Several people had got out of their cars and were standing on the central reservation barriers to get a better view. Clowns. I could see cars going in my direction (doing 70 mph) were swerving slightly as they noticed people on the barrier doing this. It would only have taken one person to slip and god knows what would have happened.Anyway rant over....Tomorrow: Don't Run With Scissors. by 6ft Wasp at 10:20 PM   | postCount('110658629904591498');

Precautions
E woke up with quite a rough cold on Friday and had quite a bit of a temperature. The cochlear implant centre in Manchester have instructed all parents of children with implants (as I guess all centres have) to get in touch with either them or the hospital as soon as any kind of ear infection is suspected. This is as a result of a study in the US and an awful lot of evidence that people with implants were at more risk of meningitis than the non-implanted. Although it particularly applies to a type of implant she doesn't have there is still a bit of risk especially considering her history. She has been immunised (as best you can anyway) but we know from experience what a dreadful thing it is and how quickly it can take over.Anyway we phoned up and they told us to get over to Manchester Royal Infirmary straight away - an hours drive. No messing around. They gave her the all clear on the proviso we kept a close eye on her over the weekend (of course) and went back to see someone on Monday. They did consider keeping her in overnight on IV. antibiotics but in the end she came back home with the medicine. It was probably just a heavy cold. It does bring home though the fact that we have to watch her like a hawk now, even for things like this where most parents can just let the child recover in bed over a few days. The good news from the follow up today though is they had a closer look after removing a big chunk of wax (sorry!) which has always stopped doctors being able to get a good look in the past and there is no sign of infection or anything inside the ear canal so it looks like the cholesteatoma is not returning at least for the moment which is great to know. by 6ft Wasp at 5:04 PM   | postCount('110658603803757068');

Cathedral
My wife is currently studying at Liverpool University. On Saturday as she wanted to go and get a few things from the University Library we all went over and I took the children for a wander. We decided to go for a walk round the Roman Catholic Cathedral. I hadn't been there since my own University days and I had forgotten what a lovely peaceful place it was. It is so well kept and like so much of Liverpool a lot of work has obviously gone on in recent years to improve the land around it. A superb new set of stone steps down to Hope Street from the main entrance and a smart coffee shop area on the corner have been built.There was nothing going on in there during the day so we were free to walk round. I am not Catholic myself, in fact I'm Atheist, but there is something wonderfully calming about places like this. All the little alcoves and areas where anyone can go were lovely. Normally when I go there it is for the beer festival in the crypt which is a totally different kettle of fish. Anyway inside there were some musicians (about 20 or so) who were obviously allowed in there to practice. Now I don't now if they were the string section from the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (if anyone knows who they were then let me know!) or something but they were absolutely brilliant. They obviously go and practice in there because the acoustics are so amazing but I left feeling like I had just seen a free concert. Even when they were warming up between pieces the sound was fantastic with one instrument sounding like 20 being played at the same time with the reverberations. In fact at times it sounded more like a Brian Eno recording than a string section.I just wish I could have stayed longer but unfortunately it didn't hold as much interest for a 4 and a 6 year old who wanted to go back to the University car park and see if the dead rat we saw there with his eyes missing was still there! Each to their own. by 6ft Wasp at 3:29 PM   | postCount('110597546956011720');

American Sign Language
When E became deaf we searched everywhere on the internet for snippets of British Sign Language with none to be found before eventually finding a CD ROM we could buy. I saw this ASL link today which is an American site with loads of video clips of words being signed in ASL. What a great idea to encourage people who wouldn't necessarily get to learn any, to learn at least a few signs if all they have to do is click on a web site.It is interesting to see that a fair proportion of the signs are totally different in ASL to BSL. by 6ft Wasp at 7:02 PM   | postCount('110608004461296747');

Head Bang
We had a right old scare the other night. The children were just playing and being really good. They were having a little hug and both rolled over backwards. E fell against the hearth and cracked her head really hard against the edge. There was blood everywhere. It was a very scary moment but I am told head injuries do bleed a lot. Fortunately it didn't knock her out or anything and after a few minutes of blood and panic she did start to calm down.We then started to think about the implant as the bump/gash was on the top of her head about 2 inches away from the implant site. It could quite easily have been dislodged (the receiver is attached to the inside of the skull) or the bang which was a big one might have just broken the implant outright. We hooked her up and fortunately straight away we knew it was still working. That was a relief too as the thought of first her being without it for however long it takes to arrange another operation and then another actual operation to go through doesn't bear thinking about.It must happen that people's implants breakdown etc. and that must be so hard to know you have to go through the operation again.Anyway we took her to the local A&E. They glued up her wound and after giving her the once over we could go home. By bedtime apart from the huge lump on her head and glue in her hair you would never guess anything had happened.Unless you looked at her parents that is! by 6ft Wasp at 10:27 AM   | postCount('110552576056167573');

Hanen
We have been invited to attend a Hanen course over the next 6 weeks. We had never heard of it before but it appears to be a program specifically designed for young children who have a delay in developing language skills.There are 7 sessions, 5 of which are for parents only and for the other 2 someone comes to your house so your child can be involved. It does look interesting and it starts next week.It isn't specifically for children with a cochlear implant or even just deaf children but looking at the Hanen website it seems to fit in very nicely with the level E is at. The following topics are covered:
How to become more sensitive to their child's communication by observing, waiting, and listeningHow to follow their child's lead and respond in ways that promote interaction and communication and establish a foundation for early conversationsHow to create and take advantage of everyday opportunities to help their child communicate and use languageHow to use language with their child in ways that improve the child's ability to understand and express him or herselfHow to play with their child and use toys, books, music, and creative activities as opportunities to enhance communication
We'll see how it goes. by 6ft Wasp at 9:10 AM   | postCount('110508944170898658');

Miss Plastic Surgery 2004
Those crazy Chinese, communism is well and truly dying. They now have a beauty pageant purely for women who have paid to have their looks improved and here is the winner!I can just picture the judges pushing their faces up against the contestants looking for the join or squeezing breast after breast to find the most natural implant. They have no trouble finding people to judge it though I guess. I personally think it is outrageous the plastic surgeon doesn't get an award as part of the deal.No Great Leap Forward but here is the article on reuters, just as proof that I haven't just added a sexy Asian babe in swimsuit element to my weblog to increase hits although thinking about it that's not a bad idea. In fact tune in tomorrow for naked celebrities, Man Utd , porn , ebay, sex and any other search engine keywords that I think of by then. by 6ft Wasp at 8:48 PM   | postCount('110348930583930202');
