Paul's Play Room
=====================================================================
 
Hi. I'm Paul. This is my electronic play room. You may find things that are cool and you may find things that offend. Since this is my page I can do whatever I feel like. Yeah, that sounds pretty snobby, but in a world with little chance to get away and just do what I want, what the Hell??? Everything here is something that is fun for me. Why would I put stuff I don't like here, anyway?
This place is always changing, just like the rest of the world.

I like playing with electronic pictures. Check out my Family Photo Album 
I love playing computer games. Here are a few that I've been working on:

* King's Quest VI 
* The 7th guest 
* Quake 
* Duke Nukem!

O.K.. You're probably wondering what I do. I work for a company called Schlumberger. I do a lot of Health, Safety and Environment type stuff in a manufacturing facility. Ya know, yelling at people for not wearing their safety glasses, looking for safety hazards, trying to keep our employees healthy and the likes.
In my spare time (Sundays) you can usually find me in front of the TV watching NASCAR Winston Cup racing and rooting for Dale Earnhardt!
