Linking to DivX® software on your site

A lot of people write us and ask about putting DivX software on their web sites. If you would like to do this, you should include the Download DivX web badge (shown below) on your site and link it to this page. (This is the first official web badge. We'll roll out more in the future.)

(Link to http://www.divx.com/divx/) 

Please do not mirror the software on your web site. We pay a lot of money for fast servers and bandwidth, so save yourself the trouble and the cash and just link to us. And when you do link, please do not link directly to the executables, because we may change their names in future versions, and your old links will break. Other than that, link away!
