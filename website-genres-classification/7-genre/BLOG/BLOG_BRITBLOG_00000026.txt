Hemp yarn from House of Hemp in 'gosh', kingfisher blue / green. Very, very nearly there

Toria started it and has run out of steam.

SECRET 
TOP SECRET 
Even more secret. But I can never time my knitted presis for birthdays, particularly close-to-christmas birthdays. Nuff said.

I can't work myself out 
I am an amazing procrastinator. I have a mountain of pre-work (academic reading and ingesting) to do for my next psycho-neuro-immunology clinical training and I have until the middle of April to do it. Brilliant. If I hack away at it every day, or at least 5 out of 7, I'll make it easily. So what am I doing? I'm reading *around* the subject! I've become enamoured of immunology texts. Hmmm. Useful, fascinating, relevant texts, but not the texts I am supposed to know intimately by the time it comes to 8 days training and four days of clinical assessments with real patients. Just thought I'd throw that out into the ether in case there I get an echo. I am taking a week off (Holiday? What's holiday?) before Easter, and I have a suspicion that's when I'll get the work done. I know this because this is what I have done all my academic life. Odd.
Phoebe and Cleo off to be spayed
Tomorrow morning P and C are off to the vet's to be spayed. This means no food from 9pm tonight onwards. They were out all last night (was there a rave somewhere?) and spent all day on my bed, haven't eaten anything. Must be full of rabbit. Now (6pm) they've trotted off out again, so I am hoping against hope that I can catch them later on and keep them in all night. They will not be happy, but the bunnies will have a night off. 
Saint Chris of the order of the Knights in Shining Armour
I didn't tell you this, did I? It's been a long week. Tuesday afternoon, Phoebe had not been well (long story) and was taken to the vet where she had to undergo indignities untold, so escaped in a huff as soon as we got back. Later on I went out to call her (again) with Chris and heard frantic yowls from the area of the stream. Flipping cat. Every wet emergency went through my mind in a flash and we pelted down in the pitch black. No street lights, no moon, pitch black. I called frantically and Phoebe yowled hysterically. This is where Saint Chris drew out his night (red) light, jumped in the briny and waded upstream to whence the shrieks were emanating. Phoebe trapped in a bush with the tide rising? Stranded on a rock? Injured from a tussle with a pike? Weakened from her ordeal at the vet's and sinking in quicksand? 
No. Phoebe bouncing over the field, dry as a bone, this side of the stream, through the hedge, up into my arms, very pleased with herself. Cleo had come out with us and they both took advantage of a lift back to the house. Chris meanwhile had to exit the stream onto the opposite bank and come the long way home soaked through to the middle. Complete hero.
Toz and Dad in Manchester
Daddy took Toria up to Manchester to the uni for her interview, and to look around. 4000 applicants, 400 places, they'd whittled candidates down to those they had offered interviews, and Toria was offered a place. She'll need an A and 2 Bs - hard call when the subjects are maths, chemistry and biology, but she should get them, so I think she will accept the offer. The department is excellent, Manchester unversity is lovely and the city is fine (seriously good art galleries again) if you stick to the prescribed areas, never go anywhere alone and spend a lot of money on taxis. No different from London or Leeds. Leeds will probably be her 'security' choice. Or maybe Sussex. She may even tell us :)

Look what my Secret Pal sent me! 
Is this not wonderful? Deep rich red wool, fine DK, just the gauge I love - 72% cocoa chocolate (I am munching as I type) - fragranced handwash - all exceedingly yummy. Thank you so much, Secret Pal!!!
DH Mike and DS1 and 2 look on, mystified, as I open the packet. Then one of them ventures "This is a girl thing, isn't it?". Little smile and a deep nod from DD Tozwink. "Ahhh". Boys tiptoe back to the relative peace and quiet of drills and air compressors and paint and canvas. They'll catch on one day. They are, after all, beginning to realise that anything girls can do, they can do too. Just not the baby thing, but probably almost anything else. Oh tee hee hee. I can't be the only one to take delight in this?
This is what Chris' bedroom looks like at the moment
That's Adrian in action, tending ancient bricks, horsehair, wattle and daub with finesse.

Cleo, showing off just how stripy she actually is. This was just before she climbed up my leg to catch the whirry thing that comes out of the little black box I was holding.
