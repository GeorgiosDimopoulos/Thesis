to
the home
of " Fargo Rick " 
Welcome to FARGO NO DAK. We have a population of about 80,000 and we are located at the borders of No Dak, So Dak and Minn. 
We are in the Red River Valley which follows the Red River north to Canada and got its name from its color. 
Our college is NDSU (North Dakota State University) and the sports teams names are the Bison. We have a triple A baseball team and they are called The Redhawks, our basketball team is the Beez and the hockey team is the Ice Sharks. 
Things to do include: fishing (both regular and Ice), hunting (Geese, ducks, and deer etc), going to the Fargo Dome for all sorts of entertainment. 
Let me introduce my self,my name is Rick I was born in Devils Lake, No Dak, moved to San Diego Ca in the 60's and back to No Dak in the 70's. I have been in the parts related business since the 60's, most of it was auto,tractor and industrial parts. 
I decided to create this page for my grandchildren, so when they get computer classes in school they can see the cool page their grandpa made and realize you can teach an old dog new tricks, and that education is important part of life, and that it is unending and upgradable. 
My likes are art,golf,computers,tropical fish,plants,people camping,biking,walking,fishing,barbequing,fixing broken things, restoring furniture,photography,camcording and something I havent done for a long time shooting with a 22 rifle. 
So to my grand children I dedicate this site and a message to pass along to them is always give back more than you take in life and the whole world will be a better place to live. 
BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS TO COME IN THE FUTURE. My Link Pages...... But still under construction...!!
