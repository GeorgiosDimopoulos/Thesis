What: Posted below are the Central Intelligence Agency's two most popular publications--The World Factbook 2003 and the Factbook on Intelligence--in compressed, .Zip file format, for the convenience of visitors who wish to download a personal copy. 

Updates: We occasionally update these publications, so if you rely on the data for more than simple informational purposes, we recommend that you check back periodically for updates.

Format: The files for both publications are in standard HTML format. They have been compressed in .Zip format for ease of distribution.

Created with: The files were created with WinZip®, but any program that supports the .Zip format may be used to uncompress them.

To unzip (uncompress) the files:

1. Create a file folder or directory on your computer's hard drive or on a peripheral storage device in which to store each publication downloaded.
 
2. Download the desired file or files listed below to the location of your choice.
 
3. Unzip the file or files you downloaded into the folder or directory you created for storing the publication.
 
4. Do not unzip any file into a folder or directory other than the one you created. The process of unzipping the files will create subfolders or subdirectories required for the publication to be usable on your computer. If you unzip files into these subfolders or subdirectories, parts or all of the publication may not work.

Virus check: All files were checked with up-to-date commercial virus detection software prior to posting and, to the best of our ability to determine, were free of known viruses at the time they were posted.

How to use the publication: The files named index.htm and index.html open the publications' home page. Navigate to the index file in the folder or directory you created using a file manager, such as Windows Explorer, then double-click it to open and begin using the publication.

The World Factbook search feature: Please note that the downloaded World Factbook functions as a stand-alone publication on your computer with the exception that clicking the Search link will cause your browser to attempt to connect to the CIA's Internet website. The search software resides on our server and cannot be distributed with the World Factbook.
