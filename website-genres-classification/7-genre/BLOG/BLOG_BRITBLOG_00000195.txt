Gone but not forgotten : Filed Under 
I've come out of retirement for one reason.
John Peel has sadly died.
Shuffled off the mortal coil.
Passed on to the big Kop in the sky.
Gone to meet 'is maker.
Gutted.
R.I.P

See you round : Filed Under Thoughts 
After thinking about this for a while and realising I don't post much any more I've decided to put heppyworld.com on hiatus for the forseeable future.
There are a number of reasons, mainly that I don't feel I have anything to write about right now. I look back at some of the things I've said and they make me laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of what came out of my head, but sadly that doesn't seem to be happening any more.
So, while the site will stay live, the posting will cease until I've found something to say. I do have an idea for something which may or may not come to fruition but until that time, thanks for reading and if you want to be kept informed of whether or not I come back, send me an email by clicking CONTACT ME on the bottom right, or register at the forums.

Hooray : Filed Under News 
Finally, the website is fixed. Turns out they changed server security settings but once again didn't bother to tell any of their clients.
Still, we're back and I'll try and be a bit more prolific than in previous weeks.
You should all go out immediately and buy this because it's pretty much the best album of the year.

Yes I know..... : Filed Under Rants 
it's pissing me off too.
I complain to my hosts, they tell me they've fixed the problem and i should check the site, I do to no avail.
There is definitely something screwy going on with their server in that it doesn't want to recognise php includes with a global address (ie http://xxx.xxxxx.xxx) but it seems to work with a local one. However, i have to leave the site like this so it can be seen by the support people.
So sorry.
Things i've been meaning to write about.
1> the girl in the cafe on monday who interrupted my conversation with the fabulously titled Ms Titley to ask whether I had done the 1070 course? I hadn't and I still don't know what it is. Apparently it's something to do with stopping your mind interrupting what you want to say.
I think she meant I was rude.
2> Mark Lanegan's Bubblegum album.....genius
3> It's my mum's birthday today. I've no idea how old she is. My entire life I've always thought she was born in 1944, but I think I'm way off the mark. Anyway, happy birthday crazy mum.
4> Disney Kids Awards.....recording tonight at the Albert Hall. I'll be there waving on Dick and Dom and getting uproariously drunk at the after party and from there no doubt I will insult celebrities and be rude to friends. It's what I do.
5> Tell you about the drunken experience of two weeks ago at a 'team bonding session' and explain why team bonding is always a bad idea if alcohol is involved. 14 vodkas and 2 beers. Need I say more
So, if you can work out what kind of spiritual mumbo jumbo 1070 is, please click the contact me link and lett me know. All I've got so far (from Donna) is that it's a cult ham radio group.

Heppys First Words : Filed Under Rants 
Nope. Nothing to do with my initial utterings at the age of 18 (I was a very quiet child) but in fact the first thing I say every.single.day as I wake up in my Islington abode.
When I say every day no doubt you're thinking "ah, that wag, he's exaggerating for the purposes of literary license". Well, I'm not.
So what do I say?
"Oh for fucks sake!"
Why?

Grr. Me. Man : Filed Under Humourous 
This just arrived in my inbox.......I particularly related to the bit about a thin stick in the shed..
Subject: 25 things that make you feel like a real man.
1, OPENING JARS - nnng, she's struggling. You take it from her hands, open it effortlessly and pretend she loosened it for you. She didn't. Jars are men's work.
2, CALLING SOMEONE 'SON' - Especially policeman but even saying it to kids makes you the man.
3, DOING A PROPER SLIDE TACKLE - Beckham free kicks? Gay. A Stuart Pearce tackle is the pinnacle of the game, simultaneously winning the ball and crippling the man. Magic.
4, SHARPENING A PENCIL WITH A STANLEY KNIFE - Blunt, is it? Hand it here love. No, I don't need a sharpener, you think I can't whittle?
5, GOING TO THE TIP - A manly act which combines driving, lifting and - as you thrillingly drop your rubbish into another huge pile of other rubbish noisy destruction.

Sporadically Deserted : Filed Under Nothing Special 
So, things have been somewhat quiet here at HeppyWorld for a while. This is due in no small part to eking out every available second of weekend relaxation before The Big Push which is the return of Dick & Dom and the end of my weekends for 32 weeks.
This means no late Friday or Saturday nights and when I want to go and get battered on a Sunday night, everyone else is complaining that it's a school night and have to get to bed early.
Lightweights.
Things I currently like.
The new Libertines album.
Dodgeball - There is absolutely nothing that isn't gut bustingly funny about a bloke in a wheelchair throwing monkey wrenchs with great gusto and speed at 6 grown men.
Repeatedly. Plus, Rip Torn is a scene stealer. See it. Now.
I succumbed, and bought a new Ipod but went for a 40Gb version.
Which is already FULL. 6753 songs thanks for asking.

Bungalow returns in 12 days.
There go my weekends.....

Hair Raisin : Filed Under Nothing Special 
My hair doesn't do much.
It just sits atop my head making insignificant advances into the atmosphere.
When i was younger my mum was a hairdresser. This placed me in a difficult position, as being 10 there wasn't much of a choice I could make in terms of hair styling it was
"sit down and keep still"
Except that didn't happen very often because my mum loved my hair being long.
This would be fine if it weren't for the fact that when I say my brown locks don't do much what I really mean is they have never deviated from the direction they were originally pointing growing via a DNA type twist.
In other words.
Leo Sayer type hair.
I have the photographic evidence and no, you will never see it.
My point being is that now I take responsibility for my own hair and with my clippers get an immense satisfaction just shearing it all off, looking at the remnants on the floor and then vacuuming the debris away and once again feeling light and fluffy.
Oh, and this week I'm doing an extra Top of the Pops Saturday and have the delights of directing Peter Andre, The 411 and a RAWK band called Kane.
