Page information:
 
* This homepage only exists to keep my growing number of business links manageable. It's been written in English so some colleagues might also use it. 
* You won't find anything of importance here - unless you are interested in gravitational waves, electronics, physics, computers or programming... 
* I'm currently working as an electronics engineer at the Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik in Garching, Germany. 
* The picture of me was sketched in 1992 by a french cartoonist near the Eiffel tower in Paris, and I have to admit it's still pretty close. 
* Should you find some typing errors, or links to non-existing web pages, or something else rather unpleasant, please send me an e-mail.
