C.P.G.H.  
Date: May 5, 1998How we met: Pouring beer at Music MidtownPrevious flirtations: PhoneWhat we did:The day before the date, panic set in. You'll notice that this is the very first first date of my adult life. I had no idea what to do. All I knew about dating I had learned on Melrose Place. In retrospect, Amanda, Sydney, Alison, and Jo were not exactly role models I should have wanted to follow. At this point, I had to call my little sister and ask her how to date. Did I invite my date up afterward? Did I offer to pay? Did I meet him there or accept a ride? Did I wear a skirt? Pants? Chew gum or no? What the hell do you talk about on a date????Unaware that he was my first dating experiment, poor CPGH took me for a very nice Cinco de Mayo dinner at a charming little seafood restaurant in Virginia Highlands (trendy little neighborhood in Atlanta). Most things went smoothly at the restaurant....good conversation, good food. Only one first date mistake at the restaurant: I'm a food sharer, so it is second nature to offer up whatever it is I am eating. When I offered him a bite of my fish (on my fork of course), he looked extremely surprised and declined. Embarassing, but not so bad.Later he took me home. Unsure of what to do, I asked him if he wanted to come upstairs (what does this mean? Are we going to, like, do it??) We walked into my apartment and stood in the kitchen and talked. Then College Sweetheart called and I freaked out. I pushed CPGH from my apartment. When he puckered up for a kiss at the door, I gave him a hasty peck on the lips, and closed the door.First first date out of the way. Whew....How long it lasted: This is the only date at this go-around, but this isn't the last we'll see of CPGH ....The nickname: What's a CPGH? Well, he wasn't known as such at this point, so be patient and I'll tell you when we get there. ;)  posted by The Original Gridiron Goddess @ 6:04 PM    0 comments

College Sweetheart  
Date: July 1, 1994How we met: In college. Friends for a year before datingFlirtations leading to date: A year-long friendshipWhat we did:My college honey and I were friends for a while, then finally had our first kiss while watching "Milo and Otis." (Awwwwww). To celebrate, we decided to go for our first official date the following evening.I was full of a wonderful sort of anticipation. This could be something big....we had been friends for a while, and now he was taking me to dinner!! I knew he would take me somewhere wonderful, as we would surely want to remember it always, perhaps sharing with our children or grandchildren someday.He took me to Wendy's. Not only that, but he went through the line before me. Then he paid just for his own food. I had to pay for mine separately. I had a baked potato with cheese and a frosty.How long it lasted: 5 yearsYup, going dutch at Wendy's wins you five years worth of me.  posted by The Original Gridiron Goddess @ 4:16 PM    5 comments   
Purpose of this Blog  
Over the years, I have had an extraordinary number of first dates. I have had significantly fewer second ones. I will use this spot to list out my first dates from farthest back to present day. I will take note of what the date was, how we met, what led up to it (email/phones/etc), and what ended up happening. Enjoy!  posted by The Original Gridiron Goddess @ 12:49 PM    2 comments
