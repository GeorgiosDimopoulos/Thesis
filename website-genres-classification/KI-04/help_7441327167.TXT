Introduction 

This is the calendar FAQ. Its purpose is to give an overview of the Christian, Hebrew, Persian, and Islamic calendars in common use. It will provide a historical background for the Christian calendar, plus an overview of the French Revolutionary calendar, the Maya calendar, and the Chinese calendar. 

Comments are very welcome. My e-mail address is given above.

Changes in version 2.6 

The names for the six additional days of the French revolutionary calendar have been corrected. 
A few minor corrections have been made. 

Changes in version 2.5 

A new section 2.12.4 has been added and the following sections  renumbered. 
The description of the calculation of the Epact in section  2.12.5 has been rewritten. 
Chapter 5 about the Persian calendar has been added and the  following chapters renumbered. 
Section 10.5 now mentions a couple of calendar books. 
A few minor corrections have been made. 

Writing dates and years 

Dates will be written in the British format (1 January) rather than the American format (January 1). Dates will occasionally be abbreviated: ``1 Jan'' rather than ``1 January''. 

Years before and after the ``official'' birth year of Christ will be written ``45 BC'' or ``AD 1997'', respectively. I prefer this notation over the secular ``45 BCE'' and ``1997 CE'' (See also section 2.13.4.) 

The `mod' operator 

Throughout this document the operator `mod' will be used to signify the modulo or remainder operator. For example, 17 mod 7 = 3 because the result of the division 17/7 is 2 with a remainder of 3. 

The text in square brackets 

Square brackets [like this] identify information that I am unsure about and about which I would like more information. Please write me at claus@tondering.dk.
