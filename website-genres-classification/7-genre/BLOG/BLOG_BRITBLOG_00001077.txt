Returning soon
In January 2004 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and for almost twelve months I chronicled my experiences with breast cancer, and breast cancer treatment here. Unfortunately due to circumstances beyond my control I lost my internet access, and consequently all my archives. Although saddened by this, I am going to get the site up and running again to demonstrate that there is life after a breast cancer diagnosis.
I have had a difficult twelve months, full of fear, pain and heartache, especially towards the end. But I have come through the other side, and I believe I am a much stronger person for the experience. 
The site is still being worked on by my host and designer Stylegeek.
