How often do you clean up your computer?  
If your answer is I don't know or I can't remember, you gonna miss a little adventure on your PC (and other devices)Many years ago, I found that my printer was turned to be a huge living room of the ANT!And 2 weeks ago, I think it's time to clean up my computer.(Physically not Windows clean up) See what I found..There're 4 unusual capacitors around the CPU. It looks rusty but I don't know exactly what it is. Thanks god, The warranty has not been expired yet, so I have to claim suddenly.After I'd finished my lunch on Fri 4 Mar, I went to the A&L Center in Pantip Plaza but the center was CLOSED for lunch at 2.00 until 3.00 P.M.(It's abnormal lunch time), so I had to walk around there for an hour.If I buy a PC next time, the A&L can't suck money from my pocket anymore. posted by Garlicia at 3/15/2005 09:39:00 PM 0 comments

Jogging at Benjakitti Park  
Benjakitti Park's first public opening is on 9 Dec 2004.See how big of this park !Picazzo and I intend to jogging everyday after work but we didn't until last week of Febuary 2005.Coz Yaykoi promised Juliet to jogging there for 1 month! (Only working day about 20 days.) If she achieves this quest, she'll get a bicycle.What I can do is pray for Yaykoi to finish it. You can do it!Let's relax for a while.You'll see the long long lake.And just look on your left side. What a beautiful building!P.S. Maggi, Thanks for your camera phone or phone camera?. posted by Garlicia at 3/14/2005 08:16:00 PM 0 comments
