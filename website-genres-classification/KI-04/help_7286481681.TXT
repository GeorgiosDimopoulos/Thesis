This posting attempts to answer the most common questions from those new to the newsgroup soc.culture.esperanto (or the corresponding mailing list esperanto-l), or to the language Esperanto itself. Please send suggestions, corrections and complaints about this FAQ to the maintainer, Yves Bellefeuille, yan@storm.ca. Post questions about Esperanto in the newsgroup soc.culture.esperanto or send them to the mailing list at esperanto-l@netcom.com, not to the maintainer. 

Because of the increasing internationalization of the net, I have attempted to make this FAQ as relevant as possible to readers in various countries. It's still somewhat biased in favour of the US, though.
