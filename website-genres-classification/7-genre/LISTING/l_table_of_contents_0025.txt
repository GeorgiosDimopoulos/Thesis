The following list provides links to all of the Chapters of the Wisconsin Statutes.
The underscored "PDF" following each chapter title is a link to the chapter in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format. You will need a copy of Adobe Acrobat to view them. Click here to download a free copy. PDF is best for printing and viewing. Text looks like the official version, but searches can only be performed in single chapters.
The underscored "Folio" following each chapter title is a link to the chapter in Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format. Folio is best for searching. Text doesn't look like the official printed version and printing is difficult. 
Chapters are listed here under subject matter heads, corresponding to the former Titles, which were eliminated in the 1979 session of the Wisconsin Legislature. Searching by chapter titles for the desired subject matter is not a dependable method for finding all applicable law unless you know the book well, for the specific item you are looking for may not be in the chapter you select. For more information about this grouping or other conventions used in these pages, please see the Preface to the 2003-04 Wisconsin Statutes.
