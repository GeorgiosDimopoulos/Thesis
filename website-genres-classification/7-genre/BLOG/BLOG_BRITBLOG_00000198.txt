The cat has been moaning at me since I got in to fill her bowl. She watched me get the can, followed me into the living room, supervised the food dispensing and now that it's there, she's not interested. I give up. Maybe she just wants to know that it's there in case of a nuclear attack. Rascal.
My friend A. came out with a belter tonight at work. There was something on the radio about a cannibal eating one of his victim's brains and she asked "How many did he have ?" and I replied "Just the 2, like dinosaurs. They had a brain at the base of their spines." to which she replied "Yeah, so they could tell when they were being eaten from behind." There was a pause while the realisation of what she had just said dawned on her and then she went crimson and couldn't stop laughing. We do like the inappropriate office banter.

The cold and rain are back, just like the unwelcome relative who always shows up to parties despite not being invited. The past week has had beautiful mornings with sun and blue sky and I want that back now please, although you can keep the late afternoon polluted sun that makes my eyes hurt. There's a building site next door to my office and the dust from that just covers the area. Not pretty.

Two adverts made me laugh out loud today. First, the Clearasil one. Spotty girl bemoans spots appearing the week before she is due on stage in some kind of show. "Oh no, what am I going to do ? People will notice. Aarghh !" etc. Applies the product, spots disappear, round of applause. Cut to girl backstage about to go on and someone hands her a mask. Yes, she's so worried that people will notice her spots behind a bloody mask. Do these people have x-ray vision that we don't know about ? Jeez. 
The second one was actually more disturbing than funny. It's for a new doll play-set and it contains little hand-size dolls who have their own miniature toilet, complete with loo-roll and "realistic" peeing action. Now your children can enjoy making their dolls pee and wiping their little arses. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is all it does. Minutes of fun guaranteed. How much do you have to hate your kid to give them that ? Well, I'm hoping that the manufacturers don't go one step further and bring out dolls that shit as well. Maybe these ones do and they just didn't show it in the advert. A pleasant thought.

I heard the music of an ice-cream van yesterday while waiting for my bus home. I fought the urge to race off and find it and get a 10p mix. You'd probably only get one sweet for that nowadays. I remember when I was a kid and was bored I'd sometimes go off on my bike around the town and try and find the ice-cream van. I miss the simplicity of those days.

I did my overtime this week. Good job because it's stopped now. It was too good to be true. Apparently, the application forms for the year's temporary contract are out on Monday. I'll believe it when I hold one in my grubby little paws. I'm angry that I have to go through another interview. I am making no effort whatsoever. I'm just going to go in dressed like I usually am, no suit, and if I don't get the job this time, with numerous supervisors singing my praises, then I'll get them for discrimination. I've been doing the job for over a year with no problems. I think I've proved all I need to and that's exactly what I'll be saying when they ask me why they should hire me. I fucking hate bureaucracy.

Mike is donating money to Comic Relief by hosting a Bloggers' Disco. My choice for the playlist is "Panic" by the Smiths. There should always be a song about hanging DJ's at discos. To take part, click here.

Just got the new council tax bill in for this year and they haven't taken the single person's discount off. I'm in two minds over whether to tell them. Lots of people I know have had such problems with them and their systems don't appear to be able to correct mistakes. At least they're not over-charging us. I suppose I'll have to do the right thing and call them tomorrow but I can't be arsed if they're going to fuck up and not fix it the first time. Maybe we'll wangle another year out of them. Is that a pig I see going past the window ?

It's embarassing being caught by a colleague as you're singing "Is This The Way To Amarillo ?" to yourself whilst crossing the road.

The postman just buzzed up and said he had "a wee parcel for us". First of all, he's not our type and second, I wouldn't be telling people if my package was wee. Bless his little cotton socks.

The Erasure gig was fantastic. Very, very gay ! Andy Bell started out all in white with angel wings and ended up in his pants, much to J.'s dismay. The woman in front of us had won a competition to meet them after the show (we were eary-wigging) and was so excited that J. thought she was going to wet herself before they even came onstage. Bless. She probably doesn't get out much.
I was watching Comic Relief does Fame Academy last night (shut up ! I don't have to justify myself to you !) and one of the presenters introduced an act by saying "Singing now for your vote and her survival..." and I was thinking how much better the programme would be if that were actually true. The person who got the least votes could be thrown to the lions in Roman gladiator-style. I'd definitely watch that. I'm a sick, sick puppy.

Didn't make it in for overtime yesterday either. Just means I'll need to do double next week to make up. I'll just hope that we get bombarded with work and they make it permanent again. Those were the days, wehn you could do as much as you wanted and whenever it suited you. I miss being able to spend money like water. Most of all, I miss being able to book little jaunts away at the drop of a hat. Last year I was away 6 times. 3 trips to London and 3 trips abroad. Now I'm spoilt and I want to do that again but I just can't afford it. Maybe if I sell a kidney... Not mine, of course. The cat's organs go first !
