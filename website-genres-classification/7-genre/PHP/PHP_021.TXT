Welcome to my home page
I teach Entrepreneurship, Small Business Management, Strategic Management, and Contemporary Business in the Foster College of Business Administration at Bradley University.
In the Spring semester, I will be teaching two sections of BMA 452 Strategic Management and Business Policy and one section
of BMA 359 Entrepreneurship. 
My research and writing is primarily in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management. Over the years, I have written or
co-authored forty or so articles in those areas as well as four textbooks. I have also co-authored a textbook for the
Introduction to Business course. 
I am originally from Oklahoma, and all of my degrees are from Oklahoma State University.
Here are some ways to contact me.
