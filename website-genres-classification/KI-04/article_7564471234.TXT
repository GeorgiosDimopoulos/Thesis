Site Awards About this Site Google Field Search Problems July 10, 2003: For more than a month now, the intitle: and inurl: field searches have been broken. I first heard of this on May 27, 2003. The advantage of intitle: and inurl: over the advanced search page Occurrences section or the allintitle: and allinurl: field searches was that they applied to only a single term and could be combined with other search terms that would look through the record. So now, searchers can not do a search that looks for one word in the title and another in the body. A search that tries like "market research" intitle:tourism retrieves many results that do not include 'tourism' in the title. At first I thought this was a temporary glitch from the strange May update, but it has persisted through the June update and has continued for some time. Hopefully it will be correct sometime soon. I've updated the Google Inconsistencies page with this problem and several others long term problems.

Google Field Search Problems

July 10, 2003: 

For more than a month now, the intitle: and inurl: field searches have been broken. I first heard of this on May 27, 2003. The advantage of intitle: and inurl: over the advanced search page Occurrences section or the allintitle: and allinurl: field searches was that they applied to only a single term and could be combined with other search terms that would look through the record. So now, searchers can not do a search that looks for one word in the title and another in the body. A search that tries like "market research" intitle:tourism retrieves many results that do not include 'tourism' in the title. 

At first I thought this was a temporary glitch from the strange May update, but it has persisted through the June update and has continued for some time. Hopefully it will be correct sometime soon. I've updated the Google Inconsistencies page with this problem and several others long term problems.
