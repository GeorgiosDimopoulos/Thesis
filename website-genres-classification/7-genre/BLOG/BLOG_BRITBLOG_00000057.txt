Priceless!
At the other end of the ground, meanwhile, the denizens of the Corner Flag restaurant are pulling on their cashmere overcoats after an excellent three-course lunch with fine wines, and Villa chairman Doug Ellis has donned his tweed fishing hat and slid into his seat opposite the stand he named after himself.

Firefox 1.0.1
A Firefox security update is now available. The main fix is to let you see when "phishing" sites are trying to send you to a faked address. Download it.

How Firefox works. You should read this if you use Internet Explorer. If you already use Firefox then you may like to send the link to people who don't.

Class of 82
Continuing with the Aston Villa theme, I had a lot of fun playing with Flash MX 2004 today. And, yes, there is a link.
Aston Villa are one of only four English clubs to have won the European Cup (and did so in Rotterdam back in 1982, beating Bayern Munich 1-0 from a 67th minute Peter Withe goal).
Having seen a video clip of that goal on the excellent Class of 82 website, which retraces Villa's progress through the competition, I ended up teaching myself how to take a Windows Media Video of a classic goal and make it into a Flash video. The result can now be viewed on Class of 82!

Ellis Down Under
I don't suppose many Aston Villa fans come here but if they do they will understand the following screenshot from Herbert Douglas Ellis's PC.
I made this with Atom Smasher's Error Generator. Thanks to the Black Country Villain and Legion for giving this a wider audience (Not that our Chairman will take a blind bit of notice).
