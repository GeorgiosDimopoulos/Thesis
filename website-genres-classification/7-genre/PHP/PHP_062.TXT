About me
I graduated in June 2002 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a Bachelor's of Science (SB) in Economics . I got very interested in computer science, and have since enrolled at Villanova University, where I am working towards a Master's degree in Computer Science.
I am currently looking for a full time position in Software Development. 
MIT Groups I am or have been very actively involved with.
I lived on THiRD EAst a hall of East Campus/Fred The Dorm from 1997 to 2001 
OLC - Athena Online Consulting (I worked there part time for 2.5 years, so I'll list it here.
MIT Media Lab
SIPB MIT Student Information Processing Board. It's the volunteer student group concerned with computing at MIT.
LSC Though it's the Lecture Series Committee, its main focus is showing 35mm movies (7 showings every weekend during term). And of course it brings in speakers of interest to the MIT community on a regular basis.
ILTFP - I Love This "" Place. A group of students and alumni concerned about the direction of MIT's policies.
ISO - MIT International Students Office. I try to help out during International Orientation, time permitting.
ISA - MIT International Students Association. 
Projects
Here are a few projects I've been working on. For longer descriptions, go here
libxindic - a library for adding basic, though correct Indic unicode rendering for X windows 
http://alf-mushpie.mit.edu/ A searchable, querieable database of public zephyr fora.
IMAPmh - An (eventually) mostly complete set of command and option compatible replacements for the Rand MH and NMH mail suites, for use with IMAP mail servers.
Obligatory Links
Computer Software I use or have an interest in
 
GNU Emacs - Much more than just a text editor
Several distributions based upon the Linux kernel, primarily Debian GNU/Linux and Redhat Linux.
Fetchmail - a pretty nifty mail-retrieval and forwarding utility that I use in my mail setup. 
Mutt - The program that I use to read my email. 
Zephyr (An authenticated, relatively secure instant messanging system developed by MIT for use with Project Athena), and 
VT - A text based MUD client with support for zephyr 
Gaim - a multiprotocol instant messenging client under X-windows.
Technical/Political News/Discussion forums
 
Slashdot - News for nerds, stuff that matters. Its web forum has too high of a noise to signal ratio though.
Kuro5hin - More politically oriented that Slashdot and a much lower noise to signal ratio.
