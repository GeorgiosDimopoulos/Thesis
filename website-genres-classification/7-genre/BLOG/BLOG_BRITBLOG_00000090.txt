Occasional diary of a UK Lyme Disease patient. This is the ongoing story of my journey through treatment, with the occasional sideswipe at the UK medical system, terrible lower division English football teams, ridiculous Formula One racing rules and random attacks on the makers of cheese and onion flavoured crisps.

How I Got Here 
Welcome to the wonderful world of Lyme Disease. I didn’t always call it that, mind. Up till last year I was just a common or garden ME patient. Or CFS patient. Whichever you prefer, and believe me, that’s a whole other argument. Some other time maybe, when I’ve settled in.Here’s the story. I got sick in the early 90’s – usual tale – got flu, didn’t get better. The doctors said “It’s all in your head”. I requested that they damn well take it out of there then, and by the way, why did all the blood tests say my sedimentation rate was so high? Was that all in my head? Or maybe it was in theirs? Several haywire blood tests later, and a doctor finally decided that it’s impossible to psychologically raise a sed rate above 50 and I got a referral to Infectious Diseases.It’s rare in the UK for a doctor to even suspect Lyme, but my consultant did, and wahey!, I got a test. If only I had known how inadequate and inaccurate UK Lyme testing is. I believed the negative test result, and trundled back home.But I did get better, y’know, it wasn’t all bad. I gradually got myself back to around 85% well, and felt I was improving all the time. It didn’t last. One prolonged period of exhaustion and stress later, and I picked up a stomach bug. I’m not sure I ever put it down. The whole lot came back – sore throat, raised lymph glands, insomnia, muscle aches, extreme fatigue, but this time I got a whole lot of other symptoms – stomach problems, chemical sensitivities, food intolerance, palpitations. All good fun.And this time I didn’t really recover. In fact, eventually I got worse. Tried too many ME/CFS treatments to mention, but kept going downhill.Finally last year I went back through my medical records for clues. It turned out the Infectious Diseases doc had never been convinced that I didn’t have a chronic infection, but my GP decided to ignore his recommendations. So I started down a new route. Find a Lyme doc, wait for an appointment, get tested, get the results, take a deep breath, and start treatment.It’s not easy. Chronic Lyme is almost as controversial diagnosis as ME/CFS. It’s seen as a US problem, UK docs know nothing about it. And it’s a bugger to treat, especially when it’s been left for so long. You have to feel a whole lot worse before you even start to feel better. I’ve started the feeling worse – hopefully this is my journey towards feeling better.So that’s where I am. Why write a blog? Well, I’m a self-absorbed chronically ill woman in her mid-thirties, pretty much housebound several days a week, with the concentration levels of a senile goldfish and I can type faster than I can think.What the hell else was I gonna do?

About Me
Name:corblimeylymey 
Location:United Kingdom 
I'm one of an increasing number of ME/CFS patients rediagnosed as suffering from chronic borreliosis, often referred to as Lyme Disease. Borreliosis is a chronic bacterial infection, and if left untreated is a bugger to eradicate. 
I'm in the London/M25 area, hence my being a CorBlimeyLymey.
