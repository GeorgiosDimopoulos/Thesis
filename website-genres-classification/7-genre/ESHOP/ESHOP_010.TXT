 Ancestral Collections is a mailorder catalogue founded by Lady Victoria Leatham (LVL) in 1994. Friends and family helped financed it. This was a bold venture as there was no one working in the business who knew anything at all about running a mail order company. Lady Victoria had been involved in a small retail business for four years but her main employment had been with Sotheby’s the auctioneers and with the BBC. She still does the occasional BBC Antiques Roadshow as Vicky Leatham. At first all buying, product development, negotiating with printers and designers, copy writing and packing was done by LVL with occasional help. The original idea was to develop an ever-increasing range of goods copied directly from items in Britain’s stately homes. This naturally involved development and manufacturing costs and holding stock. To offset these, a trade business selling goods to interior designers and shops was started. At this time the catalogue was distributed to about 5000 people per issue. In order to expand the business, less bespoke goods were offered for sale, and the lower priced items in the catalogues lead to increased turnover, but still everything was based at Burghley House,.home of the world Famous Horse Trails every September. By the end of 1999 about 1,000 people had bought from the company. In 2000 with additional investment it was decided to embark on the production of a much larger catalogue with many more products included and a greatly increased circulation. This involved a fundamental change in the operation of the business. Another catalogue company was retained to provide consultancy to run a stock free business. This means that most of the goods are sent to customers directly from suppliers . This was launched in September 2000 and by January 2001 600,000 catalogues had been sent to people, mostly new to Ancestral Collections. It had to employ a "fulfilment house" to handle all the calls. Today we see a company updating its 48 page catalogue featuring over 300 items from over 60 suppliers, six times a year and mailing every four weeks, sending out approximately two million catalogues a year in total, with over 20,000 buyers. The headquarters is still at Burghley House and still sends out Jewellery, silverware and some furniture from its premises and the telephones calls are taken by people based in Stamford too. A keen eyed reader will have seen in past issues Lady Victoria's daughter in a picture frame, Jane of accounts in the hammock trying to smile in the January sun ! The butler is seen relaxing on a companion chair in the grounds, as well as the cook Christine in a heated jacket. Teddy bears pictured with the names of Lady Victoria's grandchildren. Jane's hand is on the champagne tongs, Jan the buyer modelled the acorn earings, and Louise who controls stock displays other necklace & earrings. Lady Victoria in issue 25 is seen reading on a Bacchus bench. Although not legally part of Burghley House Estate, Ancestral Collections is included in many of the house events. Partners of its staff include the gamekeeper & the forester. All the products selected are approved by Lady Victoria and she writes the copy in her own informed style. Ancestral Collections is a niche catalogue at the top end of the market with many famous clients and numerous titled people whom one of its agents tried to remove as he thought they had included the names of inns by mistake ! Whilst Lady Victoria has the eye for traditional quality items of furniture, chests, tables, writing desks and treen such as a Tazza, and urns, she also on the lookout for the fun item such as a Digging Dog and shell case Loo brush holders. The fact that the company sells items from £6 to £2000 shows it width of appeal. For the lower price end there is a coffee scoop and perfumed soap raising through various silver items and jewellery to magnificent solid silver pheasants. It is hard to categorise the catalogue as it includes Limoges porcelain and perfume bottles as well as fun Russian military figures. Indeed figures and statues both indoors such as the Alexander bust and bronze figurines and outdoors the cockerel and putto plus urns and planters are common themes. Of course at Christams time there are more gift objects and childrens games and decorations but in the summer the garden items with furniture, lights and urns and wine sticks appear. Certain items have a year long appeal such as the cushions and throws and clocks and curtains. Other items are suitable for celebrations such as the champagne cork extractor and cork screw, glasses, wine coasters and decanters and decanter drainers. Distinctly everyday is the seat pad and back cushions, but many of the bowls, candelabra combine the ideal of beauty and function.
