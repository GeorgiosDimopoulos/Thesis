A little bit about me	 
I began my academic life at the tender age of 3 when I first attended Rainbow Preschool in Libby, MT. I was not to be on the fast track long and was held back for a second year of preschool. Since then, things have gone rather smoothly. I graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in May, 2000. Since then I have resided in Lincoln, NE where I completed a masters degree in mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am currently working towards my Ph.D. under the direction of Roger Wiegand. The current plan is to start the arduous task of looking for jobs this fall and to graduate in May of 2005. Mathematically, I am interested in studying the representation theory of local rings, i.e., the structures of modules over local rings. In particular I have been studying finitely generated torsion-free modules over one-dimensional rings of finite representation type (those rings having only finitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable finitely generated torsion-free modules). Please see my research statement for more information. When I'm not trying to prove theorems, I enjoy reading (pop-up books rule!), cooking (I particularly enjoy making sushi and various Indian dishes), playing frisbee golf (yes, you can play golf with frisbees), rock climbing (this is Roger's fault), and hanging out with my cute wife (of almost four years) Katie.
