lock me up then  
drunken words bring me down to the level of impoverished souls. she tells me that i couldn't do anything to help, what am i going to do as a doctor without borders? she tells me one person alone can't make a difference. i try to explain and psh she cuts me off telling me more of her side. She thinks that America deserves more free doctors. i agree. she shot me down without an effort; making me aware that she didn't think I would come back from whatever third world country I was placed in, making me aware that she thinks that I "should be a teacher or something", making me aware that she thought I was being selfish thinking that I want to go clean up the mess in Africa that a lot of people chose to ignore.Now the Republicans are saying we went to Iraq to free the people from Saddam and to give them freedom; but why didn't we start in Sudan? Where one million people died a month. Why are certain lives more important than others? This is a pretty twisted world. and i want to help the people that are getting ignored and if you can't stand itLOCK ME UP IN QUARANTINE posted by The Last Drink You Ever Drunk at 7:35 AM 0 comments

forgeting  
I fell into the deepest dream, taking everything with me. Taking me back to the past long forgotten that had been thrown away, literally, in the black trash can one Monday morning. Taking me back to everyone. Even you. And you were the coldest, a knife just sharpened, and I had to walk away. I walked to Bruce, who walked with me to a show, where we ended up dancing on stage with the band that was playing, ironically a chick band, but so be it. Somehow Bruce burnt down the stage with the band. sadness. I asked him what was wrong with you.and then the alarm sounded pulling me out of the dream I was just about to figure out. I awoke needing to find you, needing to see if you were still sharper than a razor, with enough hate for me to poison me with white oleanders. But no, you weren't. There was not even a trace that I had ever been a part of your life. The Remember the Titans had never meant something than being more than a movie. and I suppose it's for the better. that you have forgotten about the fifteen year old girl who was too young to even be herself. if you could only see who she has become. posted by The Last Drink You Ever Drunk at 7:56 AM 0 comments
