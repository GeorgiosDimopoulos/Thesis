GreatSkin®
 
 All In One, Scalpel-less® Face Lift Cream 
More Info	 GreatSkin® All In One, Scalpel-less® Face Lift Cream 
The all-in one cream is very similar to the all-in-one serum; Cream is recommended for Dry or Mature skin.
 How would you like to hold onto your youthful looks well into your later years without resorting to cosmetic or plastic surgery? Time isn’t as much of an enemy to our skin as the dangerous free radicals caused by sun exposure, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol, environmental toxins, stress, poor diet, and sleep deprivation. As we know these free radicals can break down our skin’s collagen and elastin causing lines, wrinkles, and sagging of the skin. We desperately need powerful anti oxidants to fight and prevent this damage. ‘Vitamin C has long been my favorite anti oxidant and still is, however, there are a few new potent anti oxidants and ingredients that can even optimize and boost the effects of Vitamin C. They are: Alpha Lipoic Acid, DMAE, COQ-10, Grape Seed Oil Extract, Pycogenol, Copper, Zinc, L Carnitine, Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid, and Retinal.’ - Lori Van Wormer

More Info	 Skinceuticals Body Polish 
Skinceuticals Body Polish is a rich, exfoliating body scrub with Brazilian marine algae and botanical extracts. Body Polish eliminates dry, dull, flaky skin - revealing the even, smooth and more radiant skin below. Unlike conventional exfoliating scrubs, Body Polish contains unique, smooth polyethylene beads and natural waxes that intensely exfoliate dull skin cells - but gently without damaging the skin. Perfect for use before treatment products, moisturizers, and self-tanners.

More Info	 SkinCeuticals C+AHA 
This two-in-one antioxidant treatment works by two different mechanisms to help improve the appearance of aging skin both inside and out. Below the surface, a 15% concentration of pure L-ascorbic acid helps protect against damaging UVA/UVB rays, prevent premature signs of aging, and stimulate collagen production. On the surface, a 10% concentration of hydroxy acids exfoliates to smooth the skin and create a more youthful appearance. C+AHA incorporates both glycolic acid and lactic acid to slough off the rough outer layer of the skin, revealing newer, youthful skin under the surface.
