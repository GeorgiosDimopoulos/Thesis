Dear Mr. Neal:

(1) Many thanks for your msg (ATTACHMENT I).  Yes, I remember you well.

(2) Pls visit the web sites of our Amazon projects;

> (a) Click "Dr. Takeshi Utsumi's Overall Activities" at the top left corne=
r of
> the home page of our web site which URL is listed at the end of my e-sign=
ature
> below,
>=20
> (b) Find the Section "GUS/Brazil/Amazon" in the Section of "Global Univer=
sity
> System (GUS)"
>=20
> (c) Click "Community Development with E-Learning and E-Healthcare in Amaz=
on,
> Brazil" -- Grant application submitted to the InfoDev of the World Bank
> (1/25/02).
>=20
>> We haven't heard the final decision of this application from the World B=
ank
>> yet, but you can check its current status at
>> <http://www.infodev.org/projects/proposals.htm>.
>=20
> (d) Click APPENDIX IX and find =B3E-healthcare Education=B2 which is a propos=
al by
> John Hopkins University and its School of Nursing.

(3) When we will have the workshop, Roberto Rodrigues (a Brazilian) will
solicit the interest of Brazilians for his project (with Portuguese
language) from six Federal Universities affiliated with CampusNet in Amazon
region, and later the communities of their main campuses.

(4) I am very delighted to hear of your interest in our project.

Should you wish to follow Roberto=B9s suit, pls send me a brief description o=
f
your e-learning program and a brief bio (see APPENDIX XI).  I will add them
to the APPENDIX IX and XI.

You would then need to attend the workshop (probably in this summer, if the
InfoDev fund is granted), and solicit Brazilians=B9 interest.

As you see in the application, our project covers entire Amazon/Brazil
region (and later in other Amazon area countries, e.g., Peru, Colombia,
Venezuela, etc., etc.) -- and may soon be even Cuba and the Caribbean.

(5) Pls provide us with your brief description in English.  This is because
the revised application with additional programs (such as yours) will be
attached to our other grant applications, such as;

> (a) Travel grant application to the US National Science Foundation (from
> Cornell University) for American scholars to attend the workshop,
>=20
> (b) A grant application to the Grass Root Fund of the Japanese government=
 to
> set up the Manaus Community Development Network with the use of broadband
> wireless Internet units (which we are now working on), etc.
>=20
Looking forward to receiving your response,

Best, Tak
