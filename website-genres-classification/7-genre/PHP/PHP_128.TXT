Hi, My name is John Yap. I have done a home page here previously at this url but seriously I think the previous page s***ed big time. Having graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic last year, I am currently working in National University of Singapore, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. Dwelling in the Centre for IT and Applications at the Dean's office, I am one of the webmasters who design web sites for the various departments and produces multimedia educational development courseware/software for academic purposes. I am all ready to take on the web challenge on a wider scale.
 
I seriously hate talking about myself. I would rather let the music I listen to speak for me. Dun worry, I do not condemn any form of music here because personally I think it is a way people communicate their life, style, feelings, thoughts et al to other people. So even if it is crappy music on the radio, I dun really give a damn about it. Pretentious? Think what you want. So long as it doesn't impinge on my physical life here, you can say or do what you want. 
The artistes I featured here are but a small portion of what I hear. They were chosen not because of I love them that much but for reasons that I think they deserve the necessary attention from people visiting the site and that they are just not given the exposure they need to make future records. So guys, Keep Shining! >> Now on to the big showcase for you guys! 
Follow this link >> John's Workbench where you can see the plethora of work that I have done. See Ya!
I used to have a guest book here at the moment but I am still in the middle of locating a file. You can email me here: johnyap@nus.edu.sg or riordan@pacific.net.sg and tell me how much you love this site or simply hate this site! Thank you! *muaks* :o) 
That's all, folks... :oﬁ !
