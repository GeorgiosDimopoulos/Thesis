Which Form Should I Use? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Which form should I use? Generally, to register literary works and computer programs, use Form TX; for performing arts, use Form PA; for single issue serials/periodicals, use Form SE; for a group of issues of serials/periodicals, use Form SE/Group; for a group of daily newspapers or newsletters, use Form G/DN; for sound recordings, use Form SR; for visual arts, use Form VA.       What is the difference between Form PA and Form SR? These forms are for registering two different types of copyrightable works that may be embodied in a recording. Form PA is used for the registration of music and/or lyrics (as well as other works of the performing arts), even if your song is on a cassette. Form SR is used for registering the performance and production of a particular recording of sounds. See Circular 50, Copyright Registration for Musical Compositions, and Circular 56a, Copyright Registration for Musical Compositions and Sound Recordings.       I want to copyright my business name. Which form do I use? Names, titles, short phrases, and slogans are not copyrightable. You may have protection under the federal trademark laws. Contact the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, 800-787-9199, for more information.       Which form do I use to register an automated database? Use Form TX to register the copyright for a database. See Circular 65, Copyright Registration for Automated Databases.       Which form do I use to register a computer software application I am creating? You should file your claim on application Form TX. See Circular 61, Copyright Registration for Computer Programs.       I have several copyrights on file with the Copyright Office, and have moved since submitting those applications. Is there a form to submit to change the address on my applications? Although there is no statutory requirement to notify the Copyright Office of a change of address, you may wish to have our records reflect such information. There are several ways to do this: 1) You may file a document listing all your registered works by title and registration number, along with your new address. Your current address will then be included in our records and be available to those who search the documents file. However, the original registration records are not changed. See Circular 12, Recordation of Transfers and Other Documents, for more information, including cost. 2) You may file a supplementary registration Form CA to amend a completed registration to indicate the new address. If you have multiple registrations, filing a Form CA only on the most recent registration will effectively get your new address on record. See Circular 8, Supplementary Copyright Registration for more information, including cost. 3) Finally, filing a registration for a new work in the future will also effectively get your new address on record.
