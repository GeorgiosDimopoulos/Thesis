Your Gateway to the Circumpolar North - ExploreNorth
=====================================================================
 
    Much more than just another link site, ExploreNorth is here to help with all the information you need to explore the circumpolar North. 
    The regions we cover are Alaska, the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Faroe Islands and the northern parts of the Russian Federation. 
    With original articles and photos, and background material on the culture, environment and economy of the North, you will find information here that is available nowhere else. If you need help with travel planning or homework, just click on whichever of the interactive features you like. And to see the southern Yukon as it looks right now, check out our webcam, which looks over Lake Bennett to Caribou Mountain.
