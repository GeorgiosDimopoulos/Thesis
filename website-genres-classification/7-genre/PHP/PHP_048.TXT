RESEARCH PROJECTS
INTERACTIVESPACES (2003- ) iHOME project: Aesthetic interaction and context-aware computing for the home. A research project which aims to establish visions and technologies for the interactive home of the future, grounded in everyday lives of people. The project is a collaboration between researchers from Aarhus School of Architecture, Computer Science dept. at University of Aarhus, and Bang & Olufsen. (www.interactivespaces.net). 
INTERACTIVE ROOMS AND BUILDINGS (2001) Designing interactive rooms to support design work. With the purpose of supporting cross disciplinary collaboration in design work, I have taken part in the development of use-scenarios, concepts and prototypes for integrated wall-, table- and mobile technologies. The project was a collaboration between Aarhus School of Architecture and Computer Science Department, University of Aarhus.
Ph.D project (1998-2002) Designing for learning in use of domestic technologies. I have studied long-term use of Bang & Olufsen integrated TV, video and link systems focusing on how such everyday technologies help users learn to use the product. The study concluded that product concepts as conveyed through sales and marketing should be followed up in the interaction design and in the physical design of the product. One of the results of this study was a set of design guidelines for designing for learning in use of domestic technologies. Developing approaches to designing domestic technologies. I have organised a series of workshop in private homes, where families constructed mock-ups of future technologies and kept the models and developed these over time
BIDI Project (1998-2000) (Usability work in Danish Industry (Brugbarhedsarbejde I Dansk Industri)) From Usability test to Usability design. In a collaboration among usability groups at Danfoss, Bang & Olufsen, Kommunedata, and researchers from Aarhus University, I have contributed to developing usability from evaluation and tests towards more design oriented activities. The work comprises approaches to support both creativity and innovation in design work as well as collaboration in a multidisciplinary design team (1998-2000, part of the BIDI project – 
 
PROJECT MANAGEMENT
The IHome project under the ISIS Katrinebjerg, Center for Interactive Spaces (2003 - ). The industrial partner is Bang & Olufsen and the total budget is 6,6 mio DDKr. The project co-funds a PhD project and involves 2 programmers and a number of students.
