9/29/03 - Collection attorney James Casesa collection letter confirming receipt of dispute 

It rarely happens that a collector ADMITS in writing that he received the dispute and he announces that he ignored it. 

It's even more astounding that an attorney totally ignores the FDCPA. 

He does NOT even provide the contact info for the original creditor and demands that "all questions regarding this matter must be directed to my legal assistant ...." 

The legal assistant refused all efforts to have the correct insurer pay the bill. 

I think the references to the continued credit reporting and the request for "payment in full" constitute extortion.
