      Avatar Space Design is an organisation of artists, composers and animators interested       in the arts and technology.
      ASD conducts research and development in this field and has developed techniques       for unencumbered immersive polymedia experiences. This system enables interchange       of this experience through specially designed capture and diffusion systems over       a network.
      
      Background
      The directors are all artists whose practices       encompass music composition, performance, animation, photography, sculpture and interactive       multi-media. From this practice we have developed and continue to refine a suite       of communication tools with a diverse range of applications.
