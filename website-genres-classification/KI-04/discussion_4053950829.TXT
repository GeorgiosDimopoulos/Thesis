Turkey leftovers	       	 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
With Thanksgiving just around the corner, I thought I'd post these recipes for those of you that may have some leftovers after the holidays. Note* These were taken from homemadesimple.com Try this great casserole and turn a bunch of Thanksgiving leftovers into a satisfyingly different dish. Leftover Turkey Casserole Ingredients: 4 cups leftover stuffing* 1 teaspoon ground sage 1 cup chopped celery 1/2 cup chicken broth 10.75-ounce can condensed cream of celery soup 10.75-ounce condensed cream of chicken soup 2 cups cooked turkey (shredded) 1/4 cup melted butter * If you don't have enough stuffing left, but still want to try the recipe, use a 14-ounce package of seasoned dry stuffing mix. Instructions: Preheat oven to 425°F degrees. In a large bowl, combine the stuffing, sage, celery, and chicken broth, and then set aside. Place the celery soup and the chicken soup into two separate bowls and add a 1/2 soup can of water to each. Stir these well and set aside. Spread 1/3 of the stuffing mixture into the bottom of a lightly greased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Then layer with 1/2 of the shredded turkey meat, and pour the celery soup mixture over it. Layer more of the stuffing mixture, followed by the remaining turkey. Pour the chicken soup mixture over this, and top with the remaining stuffing. Drizzle the melted butter over all, and press the entire mixture down into the dish until firmly packed. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes. Many people we know love to turn leftover Thanksgiving turkey into a great-tasting Tetrazzini dish. Here's our favorite recipe. Turkey Tetrazzini Ingredients: 16-ounce package uncooked noodles 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 3 cups chicken broth 2 cups milk 1 2/3 cups grated Parmesan cheese 4 cups chopped cooked turkey Instructions: Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Cook noodles according to package directions until al dente. Drain, and put in large mixing bowl. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Stir in flour. Mix in chicken broth and milk. Cook and stir until the mixture comes to a boil. Stir in about 1 1/3 cups of Parmesan cheese, and remove from heat. Combine chicken broth mixture and turkey in the bowl with prepared noodles. Mix thoroughly. Transfer to the greased dish, and top with remaining cheese. Bake 1 hour in preheated oven, until surface is lightly browned. You've probably heard of Chicken a la King, but what about Turkey a la King? Try this recipe for a slightly different take on an old favorite. Turkey A La King Ingredients: 1 4.5-ounce can mushrooms, drained. Reserve the liquid. 1 green bell pepper, chopped 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 1/2 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder 1 1/2 cups milk 1 1/4 cups hot water 4 cups cooked turkey (chopped) 4 ounces chopped pimento Instructions: Cook and stir drained mushrooms and green pepper in butter over medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Blend in flour, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is bubbly. Remove from heat. Stir in instant bouillon, milk, water, and reserved mushroom liquid. Heat until boiling, stirring constantly. Boil and stir for 1 minute. Stir in turkey and pimento. Heat through. Serve over croissants, biscuits, noodles, or rice. This great salad is a meal in itself. It's often prepared with chicken, but turkey works great, too! Chinese Chicken or Turkey Salad Ingredients: 3 cups cooked turkey (shredded) 1 1/2 heads of lettuce, torn 4 green onions and tops, thinly sliced 1 small can of chow mein noodles 1 package of slivered almonds 1/4 cup poppy seeds Dressing: 1/2 cup sugar 4 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon pepper 1/2 cup vinegar 1 cup salad oil Instructions: Salad: Combine salad ingredients and stir. Dressing: Combine dressing ingredients and shake well. Pour over salad and toss. Turkey sandwiches make up a large portion of Thanksgiving leftovers. Vary the standard a little with this easy wrap. Turkey Club Wrap Ingredients: A few pieces of turkey 4 slices cooked bacon 2 tortillas Lettuce 2 to 4 slices of tomato 1 small onion, sliced Mayonnaise Instructions: Spread each tortilla lightly with mayo. Divide turkey, and put half on each tortilla. Add two slices of bacon, some lettuce, tomato slices, and onion to each tortilla. Wrap tightly and serve. __________________"The difference between 'involvement' and 'commitment' is like an eggs-and-ham breakfast: the chicken was 'involved' - the pig was 'committed'."
