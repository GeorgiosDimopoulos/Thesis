  Bad RV Dealers - Lets get those bad dealers

Hello everyone. Do you have a horror story about your dealer? I do. I know that I am not alone out there. Im thinking that all we have to do is stick together here, and we can force these bad dealers to do the right thing. From what I have found its a tough battle. But, nothing is impossible. 

Love to read about your BAD DEALER stories.

 	 		Hello, I have a story about Dan Gamel RV, and how they ripped me off. There is not room to go into the whole story here. Plus the story is progressing all the time, so I have posted to a site where I can make changes from time to time to keep others updated. The link is: 
http://www.thesqueakywheel.com/complaints/complaint3475.cfm 

This link will send the dealer an email everytime the page is viewed. But I really don't think that this bothers them. WHAT does bother them is if you call the 1-800-RV-WITH-ME number, and pick any dealer from the option list (mine was the Rocklin dealer) tell them that you read about what they did to another customer, and that you will never do business with them because of the way they treat customers!! This is the only way to make a dealer react ... hit em in the pocket book .... Thanks for taking the time to read my story ... feel free to send me feedback .... or call if you have a simular story with the same or different dealer.
