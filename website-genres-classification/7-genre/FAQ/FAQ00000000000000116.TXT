If I moved out of my house on July 1, but was not divorced at the end of the year, can I file as head of household and take the earned income credit if I have a minor child? Can I also claim child care expenses?
You do not qualify for the head of household filing status because you and your spouse have not lived apart for the last 6 months of the taxable year and are not considered unmarried. Your filing status for the year will either be married filing separately, or married filing jointly.

I recently married a Canadian citizen and am still in the process of getting her a social security number. Am I able to claim her personal exemption without her having a social security number? If not, what options do I have?
The actions you need to take depend on whether or not your wife is eligible for a social security number (SSN).

If she is unable to obtain an ITIN by the time your return is due, you may obtain an extension of time to file by using Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Refer to Tax Topic 304 , Extensions of Time to File Your Tax Return, for more information. 
. Otherwise, you will have to file as married filing separately without claiming her personal exemption.

This is done using Form 1040X (PDF), Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Generally, Form 1040X must be filed within three years after the date you filed the original return or two years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.

My 22 year old son was living with me as my dependent for the first seven months of the year. Can I claim him as a dependent on my taxes?
The answer depends on the facts and circumstances. Generally, the following five tests must be met for you to claim an exemption for a dependent: 
* Member of household or relationship test. 
* Citizen or resident test. 
* Joint return test. 
* Gross income test. 
* Support test. 
Your son does not need to live with you for the entire year in order to be claimed as a dependent because he meets the relationship test. Because he is under age 24 at the close of the calendar year, he may not be subject to the gross income test if he qualifies as a "student." He must still meet the other three dependency exemption tests for you to claim a dependency exemption for him.

My daughter was born at the end of the year. We are still waiting for a social security number. Can I send in my return and later supply the social security number for her?
If you file your return claiming your daughter as a dependent and do not provide her social security number on the return, the dependent exemption will be disallowed. You have two options. You could file your income tax return without claiming your daughter as a dependent. After you receive her social security number, you could then amend your return on Form 1040X (PDF), Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return . You have three years from the later of the due date of the return or from the date the return was filed to amend the return. 
The other option is to file a Form 4868 (PDF), Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. This would give you an additional four months to file your return; by then you should have your daughter's social security number.

My child was born alive and died 3 hours later. I have a birth certificate for my child. Can I claim my child as a dependent and take a full exemption for my child?

If I claim my daughter as a dependent because she is a full-time college student, can she claim herself as a dependent when she files her return?
If you claim your daughter as a dependent on your income tax return, she cannot also claim herself on her income tax return. 
If an individual is filing his or her their own tax return, and if the individual can be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return, then the individual cannot claim their own personal exemption. In this case, your daughter should check the box on her return indicating that someone else can claim her as a dependent.

My child is 21, and goes to college part-time. Can I claim her as a dependent or does she have to be a full-time student before I can claim her?

If her gross income was less than $3,050 and the remaining four tests are met, you may claim the dependency exemption for her: 
* Member of household or relationship test. 
* Citizen or resident test. 
* Joint return test. 
* Support test. Refer to Publication 501, . Exemptions, Standard Deduction and Filing Information , for more information.

I have a dependent child, a full-time student, who will be 24 years old at the end of the tax year. Can I still claim dependency as a deduction on my tax return for this child ? Does it matter how much money he makes? Does it make a difference if he puts all of his wages in the bank?
You can claim your child as a dependent as long as the five dependency exemption tests are met . Since your child will not be under the age of 24 at the end of the tax year, he is subject to the gross income test. The amount of money he makes will be considered in applying the gross income test. If he puts all his wages in the bank and does not use it for his support, it will not be counted as support in applying the support test. Refer to Publication 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction and Filing Information, for more information.
