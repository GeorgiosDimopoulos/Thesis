idle ramblings from my life story
Monday, March 14, 2005
Warning....My first day of work was of course boring as hell. Moving figures around on excel. It was, however, nice and quiet and relaxed. There’s not a lot else to say. I preferred my old job.Just played a gig. My SK-5 died (second one I’ve got through). I don’t know what’s up with it. I have a massive headache due to a nasty ride cymbal. I must remember my ear plugs when drumming. My bass sounded horrible. All in all a complete downer. I tried to put a brave face on it. I felt like an utter fraud.I couldn’t stay annoyed for long. We played with Umlaut. Umlaut are the best band in Sheffield. They make me smile, not frown. When I see most bands I see maths bt they are different. Umlaut touch parts of me that only Victor FME and Hot Club de Paris have tickled before. Big kisses. I like pop music better than most music. I think. Curious, I think I'm only satisfied by the extreme either way. Anything inbetween - with nod's to experimentalism or the avant garde or post this and that just doesn't satisfy. It feels like a half measure either way. It's either heart (i wanted to say cock, actually) or brain. Not somewhere inbetween.Wittgenstein said "what small a thought it takes to fill a life". My first musical memory is being at Halton public baths and being fascinated by the reverberations of shouting children (including myself) that swirwled around the ceiling. I think every musical endeavour I have been involved in has been measured up against that childish fascination with that pure sound. I don't think the music I am currently involved in (save my 'solo career' which is close to none existent) satistfies that. I know that's terribly self indulgent. I feel dishonest and insincere a lot of the time. I don't feel as though I'm giving anything back to the people who say they like me.Anyway, before I descend into complete gibberish, It’s nearly midnight. No time for a working boy to be up. The students and the wasters are partying the night away. I’m here lit by my monitor in sweaty stage clothes, a feeling that things just aren’t right. Like a Rubik’s puzzle. You get one side perfect only to comprehensively fuck up the other side.“Dear God, why is life so hard?”A question I suppose a lot of people would like answering.Anyway, enough whingeing. If you see me say hello. I might be in Tangier.Further more, it might cheer me up.Seriously. # posted by Ian : 11:54 PM   var w111084522002736140=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.]

Just checked my email and Barley has forwarded a picture of me doing a Pet Sounds: # posted by Ian : 8:19 PM   var w111074523445361458=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.] 
A New Career in a New TownWell, the temping agency – true to their word – have found me a job which vaguely resembles my last one. For less money and responsibility. Hell, the bills are going to be paid so I should be happy.So expect the hilarious tale of my re-entry into the world of work soon.There’s little else to report. I got a “talking whiz kid” toy at a jumble sale with the intention of circuit bending it. However, I can find no useful links. Strange. Unbendable? I’m tired and irritable. A reasonable band practice. Letters & Colours will be rocking the grapes (as usual) on monday night. I gave out flyers at the fuzz on Thursday. I don’t expect anyone to come on the strength of that. We got a write up in Stainless – the entertainments section of the student rag “The Steel Press” – I don’t expect anyone to come on the strength of that either, although our pictures did look rather fetching. Perhaps people will come on the strength of that. # posted by Ian : 8:03 PM   var w111074456882550634=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.]

“But oh! That magic feeling: nowhere to go”Being unemployed isn’t so bad, you get up late. You drink tea.I’m experiencing what everyone said would happen though, given all the time in the world, you don’t do anything. Seemingly vital projects such as turning a polystyrene head into a binaural microphone now seem pointless. Did I just make all these plans to divert me from the stupefying boredom of work? Having said that I have read about 100 pages of Augusten Burroughs today so I’m not completely wasting my time.Couldn’t sleep last night. Worked out how to solve the plate reverb problem – wire them out of phase! Strange how the mind works at 2.00am.Listening to the second side of Abbey Road. What a piece of work. # posted by Ian : 2:43 PM   var w111020678836194077=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.]

What a strange day and night last night.Lovely morning going for Breakfast and then shopping for bits and bobs.Found some old speakers in a skip on the way home. The kind that a charity shop would probably charge about a £10 for.(boasting) We (the yell) played to probably around 200 people at the Leadmill supporting The Go! Team. Strange, the bigger the gig the more removed and I dunno “voidlike” it all feels. I can’t even begin to explain it without resorting to clichés and rubbish.Fuelled by free Australian lager the whole night descended into madness and bruised faces and worse. Not the kind of thing to blog about.Promotion The Quiet Clams will be up and on the site soon.Don’t want to talk about anything else. Just reading about Slint on Infinite Thought. Pure jealousy courses through my veins. My head really hurts. # posted by Ian : 2:50 PM   var w111012071531386949=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.]

Day of Redundancy, Interviews Secured: 0, Likelihood of Temping: 100%,You know when I said there would be no more?I lied.I phoned the job centre today. I’m dole scum from now on.Well, I didn’t lie really. I hinted there may be an update now and then. It’s strange though, when you’re unemployed and sitting round the house, carrying out modifications to delay pedals, making speaker stands and reading Bathes and stroking your chin you don’t feel a burning desire to write drivel about how much so and so pissed you off and how this and that didn’t feel like it was meant to.Something happened this morning, though. Well, after I got over my hangover. I attempted to get heroically drunk at fuzz last night. It didn’t go exactly to plan. I stalled half way though. More on that later.Back to this morning.I go out and see my car has a flat tyre.A fucking flat tyre. God is laughing at me. I thought.Not God, exactly, actually. More someone who didn’t like where I was parked and decided slashing my tyre would be a good way to get back at me. Idiot. Wouldn’t a note have sufficed? Makes my smashed light a while back look more suspicious too.Why are people so moronic?Fuzz produced an interesting situation. Poor old Slee was brought face to face with an old girlfriend. Much hilarity of the “how do you know him”, “do you know her?” variety ensued. It’s funny, I thought it was all water under the bridge, like. Small world.Thanks to everyone who said ”hi” and “don’t stop!” it cheered me up. # posted by Ian : 5:00 PM   var w110995579673529432=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.]

Days to Redundancy: 5, Interviews Secured: 0, Likihood of Temping: 95%I'm going to the agency this afternoon.We're moving stuff out of the office this morning.Goodbye job.and goodbye blog, maybe. Funny how it lasted almost exactly a year. We've seen things come and go. Birthdays, driving tests, holidays in the sun. Hell it's been fun.This blog won't die completely. It just won't be updated as frequently. Temp jobs don't tend to turn a blind eye to the internet. Left with the task of writing useless rubbish in my own time...well I don't fancy my chances of keeping it up.See you soon.Ian.

More last nightismsAt one point I tried to smile at someone to be friendly, It just looked like I was pulling a face.I got really annoyed with people talking in my ear. And annoyed people by talking in their ears.Bleugh! People should just not try and converse in clubs.The Yell DJ'd at the Albion. I shoehorned some Fandango and Vegetables into the set. # posted by Ian : 2:08 PM   var w110934189901109235=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.] 
Days to redundancy: 8, Interviews Secured: 0, Liklihood of Temping: 90%I phoned the agency the other day. It'll be 100% soon. Oh well.Maximus IndiusI saw Maximo Park last night. Their record company are trading pretty heavily on the whole "Sunderland* is the new Seattle" thing.*or are they from Newcastle?Yes, they sound a bit like Das Futurkophs, but the comparison is superficial. They lack the wit and inventivness. One too many Journeymen in the band too. The singer's face is very expressive though. Bad clothes, mind. His banter is really pleasant. They seem like good chaps.They weren't helped by the (is it ever any different?) terrible sound. Amateur sound engineers? Who'd have em. Just because you have a fancy compressor doesn't mean you have to make the snare sound like a plank of wood slapping an old suitcase.A really curious phenomenom the "band coming alive effect" - the whole performance is a little tired and stilted (long drive in the snow?) then they play the single (apply some pressure) that's being flogged on MTV2 and all that and suddenly - wow! - you can see why this band got singed. They really come alive.Suppose every band has one song that they really really believe in. A special move...something that can get you out of trouble.Minimus IndiusLetters and Colours are playing the Grapes tonight. New material and everything. # posted by Ian : 11:06 AM   var w110933138901375529=escape(""); Comment on this post - [ comments.]
