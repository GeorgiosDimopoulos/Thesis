The Princess
=====================================================================
 
And here is my Princess whom we also call Tiggy and even once in a while her real name -- Shari. She is 18 years old, and is a freshman in college. Her interests include debate, theatre, oral interp, playing the oboe and soprano sax, piano and organ, and cheerleading. In fact, she received the All American Cheerleader Award. She also enjoys all types of dance such as ballet, tap, jazz and modern dance. 	
She was also Honored Queen of Bethel #32 Job's Daughters, a Varsity cheerleader, President of the Brookings High Student Body, and also holds an office in the State Student Council. One of her more unusual hobbies is riding a Harley with Mom, and we have gone to the Sturgis Rally for the last 9 years. 
There are more pictures of Tiggy here for my family but feel free to look at them if you like.
Here is her Senior squad. They won the Spirt of Six Award for best cheerleaders at the State "AA" this year -- the first time the award has ever been won by Brookings Cheerleaders. 
And of course, when we go to Cancun each March, she has to do something besides play volly ball and dance all night. Check out this sand sculpture! 
The Sturgis Rally is one of our favorite vacations each year.
Here she is age 13 just taking a break from the crowd and basking in the sunshine. 
One of my favorite pictures of the Princess. And believe me, her personality reflects the spark in those eyes -- 
Favorite Quotes from The Princess	 
I have no regrets for that which I have done. Only that which I have left undone. 	Acting is the ultimate high. Nothing is more dangerous than acting.
