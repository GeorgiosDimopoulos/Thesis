I have no GSM (and do not want to have one)

This site (mondada.net):

The site mondada.net is motivated by the need of a fixed reference and is possible because of the collaboration of my brother and my cousin. Just do not consider it as a sign of arrogance.
 

My WEB pages:

These WEB pages want to be a contact and information point where I give some information, opinions, feelings and more. Hope it will be useful for human contacts.
