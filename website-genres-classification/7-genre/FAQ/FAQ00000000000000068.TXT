1.12 IRS Procedures: Refund Inquiries
How long does it take after you've filed to receive a refund?
If you e-file opting for direct deposit and have not received your refund within 3 weeks after filing your return (eight weeks if you filed a paper return opting for a paper check), you can check your refund status by clicking on "Where's My Refund" then go to "Get My Refund Status" (after inputing the required data). Or, you can call the Refund Hotline at (800) 829-1954. Be sure to have available a copy of your current tax return because you will need to know your social security number shown on your return, the filing status and the exact whole dollar amount of your refund. If you have requested direct deposit, the refund should take one week less time to be issue as opposed to getting a paper check. 
How long does it take to get a refund back by direct deposit?
If you e-file with direct deposit and have not received your refund within three weeks after filing your return (five weeks if you filed paper with direct deposit), you can check your refund status by clicking on "Where's My Refund " then go to "Get My Refund Status" (after inputing the required data). Or, you can call the Refund Hotline at (800) 829-1954. Be sure to have available a copy of your current tax return because you will need to know your social security number shown on your return, the filing status and the exact whole dollar amount of your refund. 
Can you direct deposit your refund into someone else's bank account if you do not have a bank account?
No. The account has to be in your name.
Will I be notified when my direct deposit is made or will I have to check with my bank to find out?
You will need to contact your bank to determine when the deposit was made. The deposit will be recorded on your bank statement. However, if you use an automated system to check on your bank account balance, you will know that your refund has been deposited when your balance has increased by the amount of your expected refund. 
Can I check my refund status via Internet?
You can now check the status of your refund via Internet. Access the IRS website at www.irs.gov and follow the links to check your refund status. You must provide your social security number, filing status, and refund amount. 
How can I check on the status of my refund?
Refund information does not become available until it has been 6 weeks since you filed your tax return (3 weeks if you filed electronically or through TeleFile). After waiting the appropriate number of weeks, the fastest, easiest way to find out about your current year refund is to log onto www.irs.gov. Click on Where's My Refund then go to Get My Refund Status or you can call Refund Hotline at (800) 829-1954. Be sure to have a copy of your current tax return available because you will need to know your social security number shown on your return, the filing status and the exact whole dollar amount of our refund. The IRS updates refund information every seven days. Refer to Tax Topic 152, Refunds - How Long They Should Take, for additional information.

I still owe taxes from a previous year and am getting a refund this year. I would like to apply this refund to the taxes I owe. How do I go about doing this?
You may not get all of your refund if you owe certain past-due amounts, such as federal tax, state tax, a student loan, or child support. Your refund will automatically be applied to any outstanding balances. 
Can my refund be used to pay other debts?
Under the law, state and Federal agencies refer to the IRS the names of taxpayers who are behind in their support payments, taxes, and loans. Your tax refund may not be refunded to you if you are delinquent in child or child and spousal support payments, have a past due Federal debt (such as a student loan), or owe state income taxes. Therefore, your refund will be used to pay other debts you owe. For additional information, refer to Tax Topic 203, Failure to Pay Child Support and Other Federal Obligations.

Can a person receive a tax refund if they are currently in a payment plan for prior year's federal taxes?
As a condition of your agreement, any refund due you in a future year will be applied against the amount you owe. Therefore, you may not get all of your refund if you owe certain past-due amounts, such as federal tax, state tax, a student loan, or child support. The IRS will automatically apply the refund to the taxes owed. If the refund does not take care of the tax debt; you must continue the installment agreement. 
If you are under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan and due a refund, do you still get it?
Whether a refund will be sent to you, the trustee, or offset against outstanding liabilities will depend on local bankruptcy rules, the terms of your Chapter 13 plan, as well as the individual facts and circumstances of your case. 
I lost my refund check. How do I get a new one?
Call the IRS a (800) 829-1954. If your refund check has not been cashed, we can normally provide a replacement within six to eight weeks. If your refund check has been cashed, the IRS will provide a copy of the check and an Form 1310 (PDF), to initiate a claim. The signature on the cancelled check will be reviewed before determining whether another refund can be issued. 
Do you have to meet the tax filing deadline if you are getting a refund?
While you can file the original tax return at any time, the amount of any refund cannot be more than any tax paid within the three-year period (plus any extension of time for filing your return) immediately before you filed the claim. (The time you file your claim will be based on the postmark date for this purpose). Income tax withheld from wages and estimated income tax payments (made before the due date without regard to extensions of the original return) are considered paid on the due date. 
If there is a subsequent adjustment to a late filed return that results in an underpayment of tax, you may be assessed a penalty for failure to file on time. The penalty is usually 5% for each month or part of a month that the return is late, but not more than 25%. An example of a subsequent adjustment that results in an underpayment of tax is an examination of your return with changes that increase your total tax owed. 
I filed a joint return and am expecting a refund. What happens if one party forges the signature to get the refund?
In cases where there is a family dispute over the proceeds of a refund, you can request a copy of the front and back of the cancelled refund check that was issued in your name. You can also request a copy of the original tax return filed under your name. Call (800) 829-1040 and follow the IRS representative's instructions for verifying the signature on your tax return or cancelled refund check. 
Is it possible to find out if a federal tax refund check has been cashed?
If you need to know whether a federal tax refund check that was issued to you has been cashed, you can call (800) 829-1954 and request Form 3911 (PDF), Taxpayer Statement Regarding Refund. 
If you are inquiring about a check that was issued to someone other than yourself, the IRS is not allowed under the Privacy Act of 1974 to disclose any information.

Does IRS permit the U.S. Post Office to forward refund checks?
Yes, however many U.S. Post Offices choose not to forward refund checks. You should check with your local Post Office for their procedures. 
My ex-spouse owes me child support. How can I find out if he has filed and if I will receive his federal refund this year?
An individual's tax return is protected under the Privacy Act of 1974. Therefore, the IRS is restricted from releasing information concerning your former spouse's account. However, if your state office of child support enforcement has notified the Treasury of a past-due child support obligation, the refund will be offset to pay the debt.

If our tax refund is being taken for back child support my husband owes, how can I file to get back or keep my portion of the refund?
When a joint return is filed and only one spouse owes past-due child support, the other spouse can be considered an injured spouse and can request his or her share of the joint refund. If this situation applies to you, file Form 8379 (PDF), Injured Spouse Claim and Allocation, to recover your share of the joint refund. 
You are considered an injured spouse if you: 
* file a joint tax return, 
* have reported income (such as wages, interest, etc.) 
* have made and reported tax payments (such as withholding), or claimed the earned income credit or other refundable credit, and 
* have an overpayment, all or parts of which may be applied against the past-due amount. 
Refer also to our Frequently Asked Question section on Injured Spouse in the IRS Procedures section.

What is the legal procedure I need to follow in order to obtain my ex-spouse's tax refund or refunds due to unpaid child support?

The Child Support Enforcement Agency said I would get my ex-spouse's federal income tax refund if he has one. He owes me child support. I still have had no word about any refund. How can I find out if he filed at all this year?
An individual's tax return is protected under the Privacy Act of 1974. Therefore, the IRS is restricted from releasing information concerning your former spouse's account. However, if your state office of child support enforcement has notified the Treasury of a past-due child support obligation, the refund will be offset to pay the debt.

If I file jointly and my husband owes back child support, will my refund be applied towards his obligation until his debt with children services is paid?
If you are due a refund but have not paid certain amounts you owe, such as child support, all or part of your refund can be used to pay all or part of the past-due amount. This applies to a joint return. When a joint return is filed and only one spouse owes past-due child and spousal support or a federal debt, the other spouse can be considered an injured spouse and can request his or her share of the joint refund. If this situation applies to you, file Form 8379 (PDF), Injured Spouse Claim and Allocation, to recover your share of the joint refund. You must have received income such as wages, have made tax payments such as withholding, and report the income and tax payments on the joint return.
