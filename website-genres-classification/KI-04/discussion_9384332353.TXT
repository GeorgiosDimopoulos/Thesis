Recipe Request: Whipped Frosting	       	 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I get cakes at the grocery store with "whipped" frosting rather than the buttercream. It's much lighter and less sweet - more like whipped cream than the usual type of frosting. Does anyone have a recipe for that? __________________Home is where you hang your @.

I've looked there and couldn't find it. I've googled a lot too. Found quite a few recipes but nothing that really looks right. __________________Home is where you hang your @.

Debbie the icing is called "Stabilized Whipped Cream Icing" Here are a couple I have had success with. The wilton gel can be bought at some Wal-marts and Michales stores. Wilton Version: 1/2 pint (1 cup) heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 2 tablespoons Wilton Piping Gel 1/2 teaspoon Clear Vanilla Combine whipping cream and sugar in mixing bowl. Whip to soft peak stage. Add piping gel and vanilla, then continue to whip stiff peaks. Do not overbeat. YIELD: 1 1/2 to 2 cups. As an alternative, you can use Frozen Non-Dairy Whipped Topping or Packaged Topping Mix. Thaw frozen whipped topping in refrigerator before coloring or using for decorating. Use packaged topping mix immediately after preparing. Do not allow either to stay at room temperature, as it becomes too soft for decorating. Store decorated cake in refrigerator until ready to serve. STABILIZED WHIPPED CREAM ICING 2 teaspoons Knox Gelatine 4 teaspoons cold water 1 cup heavy whipping cream 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Mix Knox Gelatine and cold water and set aside. Whip the cream, and add confectioner's sugar. Add gelatine mixture and vanilla extract. Blend well but do not over beat. __________________ ~*~ Becky ~*~ Moderator Email Me!

You are welcome. I forgot to mention that the piping gel is how you add color. If you want it blue or whatever instead of white, get the colored and not the clear. __________________ ~*~ Becky ~*~ Moderator Email Me!
