Train related

I have a small picture story about a Danlink train in Frihavnen. I do a lot of Märklin digital hobby work... Take a look at my train pages if you want to know how to build your own Märklin digital locomotive decoder. 

Job and career

I did a Ph.D. in power engineering... So if you're interested in some facts about power cable insulation assessment, read this section. 

Family

Is always a good opportunity to take a lot of pictures... The best ones are here! 

 

'Till then, have a great time!
