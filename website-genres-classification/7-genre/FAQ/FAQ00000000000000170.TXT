* JStrack (Windows/UNIX) -- JStrack is a freeware hurricane tracking program for Unix and Windows 9x/ME/NT/2k/XP. It should also run on a Mac, (feedback from Mac users requested!). 
Version 2.0.0 on 20 Oct 2002 
Key features include: 
* automatic data updates via incoming e-mail (WX-ATLAN) or FTP from NHC/TPC server (a filter "reads" the NHC products and extracts the data) 
* three maps, courtesy of Ron Murphy, NWS Birmingham: Overall picture, US East Coast, and US Gulf Coast + S. FL. 
* plots wind radii (default is for current/forecast positions only). After all, you need to know where the storm's WINDS are, not just where the eye is. 
* plots NHC/TPC probabilities data (via menu---see next item) 
* menu associated with any past/current storm position from which you can plot/remove forecast positions, wind radii, and probabilities, view details on the storm (wind speeds, course, etc.), view the NHC/TPC products associated with that time/position, and so on. 
* given user's home coordinates, 'X' plotted at that point on the map 
* given user's home coordinates, JStrack can warn the user if the storm is currently within a given number (def. 60) of nautical miles, or is forecast to come within that distance (this part assumes a straight line between forecast points, and should not be considered 100% accurate!) 
* ability to run user-defined commands when storm data is updated for a storm currently on the screen and/or for a new storm, and/or for situations where the storm is, or is forecast to be, within the above distance in nautical miles. This can be used to wake you up in a situation where the storm is a potential threat, and missing an advisory could put you in a dangerous situation. It has also been used by at least three web sites to do a screen capture and update a web page (for 24x7 ops). 
For more info, screen pics, etc., see http://www.purl.org/net/jstrack or contact Jim Graham.
