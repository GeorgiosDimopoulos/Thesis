Last updated January 1997
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This document outlines the production process for historical collections at the Library of Congress and reflects that institution's administrative structure and procedures. Not every collection requires all of the steps listed; some collections require additional steps not listed. In practice, many of the operations are carried out in parallel and not sequentially.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* I. Select a collection for digital conversion 
* A. Analyze Collection 
* 1. Determine scope or extent of digitization (entire or subset?) 
* 2. Assess status of custodial division processing and housing 
* 3. Assess the status of access aids (degrees of completion, readiness, & format) 
* 4. Assess best format, e.g. full text conversion, scanned page images 
* 5. Assess the physical condition and readiness for scanning 
* 6. Assess restrictions and copyright
 
* B. Consensus on collection among custodial div, NDLP team, & Library admin
 
* II. Plan the approach to digitization 
* A. Develop method and resource plans for collection preparation & digitization 
* 1. Develop plan for required processing by custodial division 
* 2. Develop preservation treatment plan 
* 3. Complete evaluation of physical condition with recommendations 
* 4. Determine formats for capture, archiving and presentation 
* 5. Determine physical size ( number of characters, images) & special production requirements
 
* B. Determine repository requirements 
* 1. Determine scheme for file name assignment 
* 2. Register aggregate name for collection 
* 3. Estimate required storage space for digital collection 
* 4. Update NDL forecast for storage
