Welcome!
I am all done updating the web site, complete with a new menu! This should help the pages load faster for those of you using a dial up connection. 
For baby updates please visit the baby's page.
Our TV is on the fritz, and we are in dire need of a new one. If you would like to donate to our cause, please let me know.
We have new video of the boy. For a full size version (3M), please ask me and I will send it to you.

James Madison, the fourth president, known as "The Father of Our Constitution"
