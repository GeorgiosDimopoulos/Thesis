maybe a little despairing  
one of my friends told me that God isnâ€™t letting my life be easily decided. i think that's the most appropriate way to put it. easily decided, or easily lived- my life is neither, at this point in time.i called my mom last night, wanting encouragement. she was not understanding. but what did i expect? i got off the phone and cried and remembered why i haven't called her sooner.the pain needs to go. God's gonna have to take it off my hands because i have no one else to whom i could give it. rest for a weary soul. restoration in a dark valley.no one but me and he who speaks in mysteries. posted by s. wells at 10:09 AM 0 comments

raining. again. on a monday.  
another rainy monday afternoon. when will it quit?i feel better today, despite the gloominess surrounding. (not that i've really paid attention, being inside all day long as i have) the fact that he wrote me and mentioned putting our feelings aside and trusting in God- encouraged me. i feel like i can do it today. forget about it. focus on God. focus on midterms. practicing. the fact that laura told me she wasn't sure about the situation- encouraged me also.so i won't explain it. no need to. posted by s. wells at 2:52 PM 1 comments

God blesses those who realize their need for HimGod blesses those who mournGod blesses those who are gently and lowlyGod blesses those who are hungry and thirsty for justicem.5.3.4.5.6.God seems to blessing a lot of people who aren't pretty on the inside. He seems to be watching over those who ache for him and feel because of injustice.You must be watching me. posted by s. wells at 10:49 PM 0 comments   
incorrect  
i openly admitted a flaw of mine yesterday. perhaps just a human flaw, but i owned up to it. interesting how i got some unsure looks, as if they were saying- how do i take that?how do you handle something ugly? no one likes to admit blatant wrongness. no one likes to talk about hard issues.as if no one else has the same issues, as if we all don't have that intense struggle inside ourselves between flesh and spirit.humility. posted by s. wells at 10:49 AM 0 comments

not/about my life  
taking the cue. from different thoughts in my head and from reading inspiring posts from other bloggers: i'm going to step outside of my life for a minute and write like i used to.almost to the door of the caf, i had an episode with the girl who is all her own. she stood outside the caf, making remarks, loudly, about the weather and how it shouldn't be this cold now. i said, to her, actually, it's technically still winter, so....and the friend i was with busted out laughing. i guess conversations with crazy people aren't supposed to happen. you're probably supposed to pass by while she remains in her own world, cursing the weather surrounding her.i must be crazy too.two days before my jury. don't ask me how i feel- i'm not even sure. though i do know my stomach has been in knots for several days, i can't seem to get enough sleep and i have a headache from all the knots in my shoulders. on top of it all (i know i wasn't going to mention my life, as it is, i.e. the breakup) i want to talk to matt, like we used to, i want things to be the way they were, between us, and that's entirely impossible. most of all..i want someone to care.my life revolves around me.no matter how hard i try, i can't seem to connect. though i doubt i try hard enough. i spent all day yesterday not talking to God, most of today apologizing for avoiding him. i know he'll make suffering better, even bearable, but he wants my life. i gave it to him, but he wants more.morewhat i couldn't give anyone, even if i tried. i'm at the end of myself, the end of time, physical/emotional strength, endurance, etc. there is no where to escape eitherexcept his arms, but how they seem vague right now. posted by s. wells at 4:47 PM 0 comments

grey and cold  
my birthday didn't suck as bad as i thought it would. mom and dad took me to see phantom of the opera saturday night, then we had our own sort of drama on the way home- tears streaming down my face, while i tried to explain how much i hurt with memories. of he and i assailing me from all directions. (dothan how i hate thee)today has been not worse but not better. worse in a different way. i now count myself in the same place as many of my other friends. (i hate the word ex-boyfriend.) i'm just another one of those people who thought they were with someone good then gave them up and bam, finds someone much better, years and tons of pain down the road. i've accepted it all, as some kind of death sentence. "there's someone out there", "..never was the right one for you", "it gets better".ok. i give up. you're right. and i give up. {this may be the only thing i'm doing wrong..adamantly denying he was ever the one for me without even trying to listen to God about what he says..but i'm doing so many other things right.}i need some kind of break. posted by s. wells at 12:09 PM 1 comments

elegie- op.3 no.1  
i played in recital class earlier today. the rachmaninnoff elegie. what a beautiful piece. i played it as if my life depended on it, as i could identify with the words silently written on the notes. b. told me that the piece almost made her cry- and i was glad to have someone feel a little bit of what i felt when i played it. in a way it was my elegie to him. good-bye love, though i should've loved you better. i would've cried too had i not been playing it. posted by s. wells at 2:57 PM 0 comments   
turning twenty-one  
if i were a grown-up, how would you treat me? i'm about to be 21. how will you treat me? do numbers, years, months and all the experiences tied in with those mean anything to you. you all. ya'll. (?)i am weary (adj.1 : exhausted in strength, endurance,)of thinking. well, and of being ...words, words..i don't know what to say. i still feel like i'm being pulled in different directions, despite my effort in killing my precious relationship with m. i felt so peaceful, like i was doing what God wanted and like God could have all of me and things would be fine in the end...then. someones stepped in again. i'm still fighting. still. he's gone. and still.God, i need you to speak to me, like only a Father can. bc i want desperately to hear from you and i won't back down until i do. posted by s. wells at 2:25 PM 0 comments
