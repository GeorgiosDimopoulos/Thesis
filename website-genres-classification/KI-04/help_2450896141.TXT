This is a help   resource for 4th through 8th grades. We have just redesigned and reformatted   these pages to enable faster loading and display times, but some pages still   load slowly. Different browsers display graphics differently, so some math   symbols may not appear to line up perfectly in some sentences. Our educational   CD-ROMs contain the complete, searchable, indexed help facility shown below,   along with the helpful problem-solving tips section. We hope you find this   a helpful resource.
