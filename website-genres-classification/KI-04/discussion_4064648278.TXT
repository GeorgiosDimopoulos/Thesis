                                                        What are the rules? Chili recipes differ greatly in different areas of the US. Meat? Beans? Cincinnati 5-Way?
I've got a hundred of 'em!

                                                        Basic Texas Chili (very much a meat dish)

3# Chuck (Chili grind or 1/2" cubes)
1 medium white onion (chopped)
3+ Tbl Chili Powder (can add up to whole container)
1 Tbl Paprika
1 Tbl Cumin
1/2 Tbl Oregano
1 clove garlic (minced)
2 Tbl flour or masa (to thicken at end)
1 Tbl salt
1 Tsp black pepper
1 Tbl cooking oil

Cook onions in cooking oil until transparent. Add meat, brown and break up. Add spices to meat and mix in thoroughly. Add water to just cover meat. Simmer for 1 hour. Add flour or masa to thicken. Serve.

Modify spice quantities to suit your taste.
Usually served with separately-cooked pinto beans.
Serves 4 full grown men or 18 teenage girls (varies with more side dishes).

                                                        Wow, wish I had a freezer full of venison.! I think the chili should start with that; more flavor (or different) than beef. 
Here is a good one:

1/4 cup olive oil
2 large yellow onions, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 lb sweet Italian sausage meat, removed from the casings
4 lbs of ground beef chuck or venison (or cut in small cubes if you prefer)
4 strips of bacon, fried and crumbled
2 tsps. freshly ground black pepper
1 12-oz can tomato paste
6 cloves minced garlic
1 TB ground cumin
2 oz chili powder
2 tsps. dry mustard
2 TB salt
2 TB each, dried oregano and basil
3 cups canned Italian plum tomatoes, drained
1/4 cup dry red wine
2 TB. lemon juice
1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley
2 16-oz cans red kidney beans, well-drained
1 can pitted black olives, drained

Heat olive oil in large soup kettle. Cook onions on low heat til tender but not brown, about 10 min. Remove the onion with a slotted spoon and set aside. Crumble the sausage and the beef into the kettle and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until well-browned.
Remove as much fat as you can from the pot without taking the good juices. Return the onion to the pot. Over low heat stir in the bacon, pepper, tomato paste, garlic, cumin, chili powder, mustard, salt, basil and oregano. 
Add the tomatoes, wine, lemon juice, parsley and beans. Stir well and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. Taste it and correct the seasoning. Add the olives and simmer to heat through. Makes about 15 large servings. Freezes well.
