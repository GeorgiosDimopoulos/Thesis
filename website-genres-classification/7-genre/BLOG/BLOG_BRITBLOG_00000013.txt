New blog layout, it's taken me ages, and it's still not what I wanted but it'll do. Wow been a while since I posted, it's been about a week ago now since I started my new job. I've been training, at the moment my boss has got me down for 2 days a week, Tuesday and Wednesday 3-7pm. I believe those hours are just for training and then hopefully they'll go up. There's a lot to memorize, like the price plan and all the different programs. Basically I'm a 'Sale's Person' I sign women up on our program, and give them a figure analysis, which is basically weighing and measuring them and setting some weight loss goals. I then show them the exercise machines and and go through a work out with them. I worked 3 days last week, which wasn't too bad. I had to catch the bus into town, first time I really caught the bus from our place. It takes about an hour and a half on the bus, which is quite a long ride, but I'm working on my getting my learners permit very soon. I went to the doctors last Wednesday for a checkup as I'm now covered by Clayton's medical insurance. I've been feeling very tired lately, and have been having quite a few headaches, so Clayton wanted me to have a check up. My Blood Pressure was very high, 140/104, so the doctor was really worried about that, he wanted me to have some blood test's done, which I had on Saturday. I should know the results soon, he also mentioned if I suffered from Depression. I haven't in the past, but it is a possible factor, I have had a lot of stressful things to contribute to it. I'll know more in the next couple of days, but it is worrying. Anyway's that's about it here, I finally managed to finish redecorating our Bedroom and Bathroom, I need to take a few pictures for everyone to see.

Hi everyone, I'm back. Our computer had some problems our hard drive went, luckily I backed up a lot of my information and pictures. So we took it to be repaired, and we also put some upgrades on it like more memory and XP instead of ME. Clayton's parents paid for the upgrades, as well as a new printer as we were still having problems with our Lexmarks. We bought a lovely HP Printer. Which is working like a dream. On Sunday Clayton and I went to Seattle for the Saint Davids Day concert, it was really good. I really enjoyed listening to the Seattle Welsh Choir, they sang many Welsh hymns. I also met many other Welsh people, a lot of them emigrated many years ago, but thier accent is so strong. I got a little homesick by all of the Welsh accents and the traditions. After the concert there was a Welsh tea, along with a craft stall and Raffle. I spend the afternoon taking pictures, as I'm now in charge of the Website, so I'm going to be putting many of the pictures up on their site. But here's a little pic of me dressed up for the day... Welsh Costume After we left, Clayton and I decided to go on a hunt for a local British store. We tried to find it before, but didn't have much luck, this time we did. It's called 'The British Pantry' and is the best British store I've come across since being here. Their restaurant is like a British style pub, which is really cool, we stopped for some dinner, and then headed home.Last Tuesday we finally had our Car back, it's all fixed up quite nice. I was a bit sad to let go of our nice rental car, we had a lovely Buick Lesabre. I think we are going to save up for a new car for the future. Below is a picture of our rental car we had...Rental Car On a last note, I got a job!! The lady from Curves. called me today, and offered me the job. How great is that, I start tomorrow at 9am to train. This is a great confidence booster for me, as I'll be more focused to lose the weight. This is such a perfect job for me.
