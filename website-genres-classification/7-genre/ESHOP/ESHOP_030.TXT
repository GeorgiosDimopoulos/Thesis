by Sean French 
MARK FOLL IS someone you might have spoken to, although you wouldn't necessarily know it. He has been drifting from terrible job to even worse job when he washes up at Waverly Insurance, working as a claims adjuster. It is only when he is sent to Marston Greem, a Norfolk village, to investigate what might or might not be a cancer cluster caused by a waste management company insured by Waverly, that life begins to become something that Mark might believe actually involves him.

   The Burning Girl 
by Mark Billingham 
  IT'S NO SURPRISE that Mark Billingham is one of Harlan Coben's favourite new writers.

         The Smoking Diaries
   by Simon Gray              WHEN HE TURNED sixty-five, the playwright Simon Gray began to keep this diary: not a careful honing of the day's events with a view to posterity but an account of his thoughts as he had them, honestly, turbulently, digressively expressed. The Smoking Diaries is the result, in which one of Britain's most amusing and original writers reflects on a life filled with cigarettes (continuing), alcohol (stopped), several triumphs and many more disasters, shame, adultery, friendship and love. Few diarists have been as frank about themselves, and even fewer as entertaining. Featured on BBC this week. Buy your discounted copy for just £9.74 HERE.

   by Paul Gascoigne              ...AND WHAT A story it is.

 Alex Garland
  ALEX GARLAND FIRST came to prominence with The Beach. His work since has been sparse but always well received. In his long-awaited new book, The Coma, Garland delves into the subconscious mind, with brilliantly disturbing results. Illustrated with forty woodcuts by his father, political cartoonist Nicholas Garland, The Coma is as unsettling as it is mysterious. We have SIGNED COPIES!!
