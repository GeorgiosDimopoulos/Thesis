I’ve Mailed My Application, Fee, and Copy of My Work to the Copyright Office. Now What? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
How can I know when my submission for registration is received by the Copyright Office? The Copyright Office does not provide a confirmation of receipt. Currently, if you use a commercial carrier (such as Federal Express, Airborne Express, DHL Worldwide Express, or United Parcel Service), that company may be able to provide an acknowledgment of receipt by the Copyright Office. Due to the mail disruption, an acknowledgment of receipt for mail sent via the U.S. Postal Service, e.g., certified, registered and overnight delivery, may take several weeks or longer to receive. Claims to copyright may also be hand delivered to the Copyright Office. See About the Office for hours and location. Please note that our mail service is severely disrupted. (Read more details). How long does the registration process take, and when will I receive my certificate? The time the Copyright Office requires to process an application varies, depending on the amount of material the Office is receiving. If your submission is in order, you may generally expect to receive a certificate of registration within approximately 4 to 5 months of submission. I just received my certificate of registration. Why can&#8217;t I find my work listed on your database? Once a certificate is issued, it still must be cataloged and entered into our online database. We estimate that it may be as long as 3 months from the date a certificate is issued to the time the record can be viewed on our website. I&#8217;ve been getting solicitation letters from publishers. Is the Copyright Office selling my personal information? The Copyright Office does not sell information. Copyright Office records, however, are public records, which means anyone may come to our office and inspect them. Occasionally organizations such as music publishers or book publishers send a representative to the Copyright Office to compile lists of names and addresses of those authors who have most recently registered their works. Their purpose, undoubtedly, is to solicit new business. This practice is not a violation of the law.
