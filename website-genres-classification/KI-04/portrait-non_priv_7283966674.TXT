January 2004: Cover: This upper incisor, decorated with a jadeite inlay, belonged to Yax K'uk Mo, an ancient Maya king. By analyzing isotope ratios in his teeth, researchers have resolved a mystery: where in Mesoamerica the king came from. To learn more about Yax K'uk Mo and his world, turn to the story that begins on page 20. (Photo courtesy of Jane Buikstra, University of New Mexico.)

Boost-Phase Defense Against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles	 
An American Physical Society study concludes that disabling ICBMs before they release their munitions would be very difficult at best and, in some cases, impractical.	 
Promoting Physics and Development in Africa	 
To advance economically and technologically, many African nations need to simultaneously develop a culture of physics and a supporting infrastructure.	 
Localizing Energy Through Nonlinearity and Discreteness	 
Intrinsic localized modes have been theoretical constructs for more than a decade. Only recently have they been observed in physical systems as distinct as charge-transfer solids, Josephson junctions, photonic structures, and micromechanical oscillator arrays.	 

Researchers Achieve Lasing From a Single Trapped Atom	 
By combining laser cooling with cavity quantum electrodynamics, researchers have created a laser that works through repeated emission from a single atom. 	
Light as a Feather: Structural Elements Give Peacock Plumes Their Color	 
The varied and striking colors of Pavo muticus males arise from differences in the details of nanoscale photonic lattices.	 
Isotopic Analysis of Teeth and Bones Solves a Mesoamerican Mystery	 
Natural variations in isotope ratios show up in tooth enamel and can reveal where a person--even an ancient Maya king--spent his earliest years.
