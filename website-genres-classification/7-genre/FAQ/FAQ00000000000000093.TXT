13.5 Aliens and U.S. Citizens Living Abroad: Nonresident Alien - Tax Withholding
I entered the U.S. in August and I have a J-2 visa with an Employment Authorization (work permit). Can I be considered as a U.S. resident for tax purposes under the substantial presence test? Since my visa does not allow me to stay in this country am I subjected to social security tax and Medicare tax?
You will be considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes if you meet the substantial presence test for the calendar year. As an exempt individual, a J-2 visa holder will not initially meet this test. 
For purposes of the substantial presence test, certain days of physical presence do not count, such as the days during which you were an exempt individual . Please refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens , for a detailed explanation of this issue. 
In general, U.S. social security and Medicare taxes apply to payments of wages for services performed as an employee in the United States, regardless of the citizenship or residence of either the employee or the employer. In limited situations, these taxes apply to wages for services performed outside the United States. This exception does not apply to a derivative visa holder.

Under my visa as a temporary nonresident alien, I'm not subject to social security and Medicare withholding. My employer withheld the taxes from my pay. What should I do to get a refund of my social security and Medicare?
If social security tax and Medicare were withheld in error from pay received which was not subject to the taxes, you must first contact the employer who withheld the taxes for reimbursement. If you are unable to get a refund from the employer, file a claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service on Form 843 (PDF), Claim for Refund and Request for Abatement. 
You must attach the following to your claim: 
* a copy of your Form W-2 (PDF) , Wage and Tax Statement, to prove the amount of tax withheld; 
* Form I-797, INS Approval Notice, is needed if you have changed your status from F-1 or J-1 to another status prior to filing the claim; 
* if your visa status changed during the tax year you should attach copies of the pay stubs that cover the period of exemption from social security taxes; 
* a copy of INS Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, if you are still in the United States; 
* a copy of your valid entry visa; 
* Form 8316, Information Regarding Request for Refund of Social Security Tax , or a signed statement stating that you have requested a refund from the employer and have not been able to obtain one; and 
* a copy of Form 1040NR (PDF) , US Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return (or Form 1040NR-EZ (PDF)), for tax the year in question. Processing of your claim may be delayed if you submit it less than six weeks after you filed Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ. 
In addition to the documentation listed above foreign student visa holders should also attach the following: 
* a copy of Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility, endorsed by your student advisor and stamped by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services; and 
* a copy of the Employment Authorization Document of your Optional Practical Training (e.g., Form I-766, I-538 or 688B). 
if you are an exchange visitor, attach a copy of Form IAP-66 or DS-2019 to your claim. 
File the claim, with attachments, with the IRS where the employer's returns were filed. If you do not know where the employer's returns were filed, send your claim to the Internal Revenue Service Center, Philadelphia, PA 19255.

I am a foreign citizen and resident from the European Union. I plan to buy U.S. stocks, but what tax will I have to pay if I have earnings on stocks?
U.S. source dividend income is subject to 30% tax rate when paid to nonresident aliens. A lower rate may apply to residents of a member country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. The U.S. does not currently recognize the E.U. as a taxing authority.

I am a nonresident alien. Our broker withholds 30% tax on dividends. Can I get this tax back since I already owe tax in my residence country on overseas income?
Generally, this type of income paid to nonresident aliens is taxable at the 30% or lower treaty rate. If your country has a tax treaty with the U.S., you may have a reduced rate of tax. If that is the case, you should file Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, to claim a refund of federal income taxes withheld. To avoid future excess withholding, provide your broker with a completed Form W-8BEN (PDF) , Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for U.S. Tax Withholding. You may be entitled to a credit against the tax you owe to your residence country for the U.S. tax that is withhold from your dividends.
