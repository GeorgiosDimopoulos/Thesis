A Walk in Hollingbury Woods
Took the dogs out to the woods this morning. 
Things are springing into life at last. Besides snowdrops which have been visible for some time now, there are a few escaped daffodils to be seen and several primroses on view if you know where to look! 
There has been some grading and levelling work done on the newly installed 'access for all' path so that use of wheelchairs will be easier - still some places where further work is required. 
I spoke to a regular dogwalker who was mightily impressed that he'd seen a Green Woodpecker. This goes to show how important it is to draw people's attention to the things around us - they just do not notice them very often. Hopefully the access will enable more and more people to feel good about walking in the woods. The importance of urban fringe woodland sites in getting city dwellers into the countryside and learning about wildlife issues is well illustrtated. 
Hopefully if this bit of woodland is accepted into the South Downs National Park boundary, it will be safe from urban development which has always been a threat - especially since the Great Storm of 1987.

Faustian Pact
Oh no! 
I've just realised that tomorrow is the 15th and I'm due to go to the recycling plant meeting, but I also want to be at the Jimmy Carl Black/Muffin Men gig at the Komedia. 
Willing to sell soul for best formula to put me in both places at the same time!

IMPORTANT MEETING
Tuesday 15th March 2005 - Downs Infant School, Ditchling Road, Brighton. 7pm
Meeting to discuss and hopefully debate the pros and cons of having a new waste transfer station/recycling plant on old abattoir site in Hollingdean Lane, Brighton.
Issues are traffic, noise, 'biohazards', house prices, proximity to schools, nimbyism, etc etc
As I stated in my last post on the subject I am broadly in favour providing community conditions are met and perhaps we can use the issue as a way to arm twist the local authoruity and Onyx, the contractor, to help us get a community centre in the Fiveways area
If you can get to the meeting and join in the argument.
Let's make sure all views get heard and considered.

Does it give you the Pip?
There was an item on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, featuring a topic I've been thinking about for some time now. For decades, the news has been delivered following either the Pips (Greenwich time signal) or the Bongs (Big Ben). In these days of digital radio, broadcasting over the net and satellite/cable TV etc, the built in time lags in these media make accurate time checks impossible and the time signal becomes worse than useless. I have heard the Pips on analogue radio in the kitchen, followed 2 seconds later by the TV in the front room and another 2 seconds later by my DAB radio upstairs. Now, I know this sort of confusion won't cause me to miss a train or lead to worldwide disaster, but it serves no useful purpose other than allowing one to know roughly what time it is - a function adequately served by the radio presenter saying, "It's fast approaching 5 to 8." 
Isn't it funny that the crudest system - ie analogue radio - is the only accurate one!

Why Taxis?
Why do taxis qualify for the same privileges as buses and cycles? They can use restricted streets & turnings, bus lanes, and seem to be allowed to stop wherever & whenever they want, causing obstruction to all other road users.
It's not as if they are  particularly environmentally friendly form of travel - they take up space, often carry just one passenger, charge high fares, sit in taxi ranks with engines running, drive around empty, looking for customers. 
It just doesn't make sense!
Does it?

Refuse Refuse
There's going to be a meeting on March 15th about the Recycling Plant I spoke of a little while ago. Find out the details at www.refuse-refuse.org.uk What a clever moniker! I've emailed councillors and refuse-refuse to state my broad support for the project as explained in the previous item. Looking forward to some positive feedback.

Getting to look like my Dad?
I read an amusing article this morning in an old 'Red' magazine whilst sat in the doctor's waiting room.
It was about how guys suddenly realise they're getting to be/look like their Dad. This of course is one of the greatest fears we experience in our youth.
How true it is though, that one day we wake up, look in the mirror and see, not the image we're used to seeing looking back at us, but our father! What a shock!
I'm 53 and it happened to me fairly recently - quite late according to the writer of the article. I was struck how many of Dad's facial features I seem to have developed - I won't say inherited because I'd swear they weren't there before!Perhaps it's something to do with my having lost my Dad about 3 years ago - maybe I'm preserving his memory by developing his looks. Who knows. C'est la vie!

where has all the time gone?
Have you noticed there's a shortage of public clocks which tell the correct time in our towns and cities nowadays?
Assumptions are made that in this digital age we no longer require such objects.
Not all of us want to wear a watch on every occasion and it's often very useful to be able to just look up and check the time when running for a bus or something like that.
Not only that - our old town clocks had something to say architecturally and also gave a sense of community.
Just a thought - not all progress is good progress.
