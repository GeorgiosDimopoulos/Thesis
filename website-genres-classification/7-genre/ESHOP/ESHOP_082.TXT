All the products we sell, both on this website and in         our catalogue, are rigorously tested for fun factor. Whilst they are definitely         fun, they are certainly not food, and as such pretty well all of them represent         a choking hazard, so please try to stick to the more usual food groups if         you’re feeling peckish. Without wishing to labour the point (but manifestly         doing so!) none of our toys are meant for children, unless they’re all big         and grown up – the children that is. And remember, never leave a naked person         unattended.
