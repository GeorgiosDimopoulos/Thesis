We took our first trip to see our new (and very nice) health visitor today.  The only problem was waiting to get in.  Unlike the last clinic which was done at a local church hall complete with playmat and toys, this one is in the doctors surgery.  Now the waiting room isn't the largest of rooms, especially not when you've got over ten buggies crammed in there.  But add to the equation a number of children who clearly think theyhave better things to do with their time than sit in their buggies and that's ten kids too many in there.  Not to mention the fact that we were there reasonably early and still ended up waiting around and hour.  
Something that surprised me is that Tommy's only put on half a kilo in the past two months.  Somehow it seems like more than that.  He was also fairly well behaved whilst being subjected to stripping off for the weighing scales (something he's not had to do since we were in Brasil), which was rather unlike him.  
He managed to flirt with the assistant and the student nurse whilst the rest of us were discussing tooth-brushing and the latest tactic is to let him brush our teeth in the hope that he'll let us brush his.  This could be interesting.  
And, whilst we're on the subject of flirting, I was in the bank with him yesterday and within minutes of locking eyes on a very nice young assistant, he's managed to score himself a heffalump.  I hope this boy is not going to be too difficult to handle in later years!

After battling with thecomputer playing the sound of a movie but no image, only seconds before Yuri fixed it, someone managed to turn the TV on to Air Force One.  I was none too impressed.  It's times like this that it's really not practical having so many people in a two bedroomed flat.  We really need somewhere else other than the living room to spend time.  The kitchen's too uncomfortable and the bedroom is out of the question due to Tommy's appallingly light sleeping. 
Hopefully, tonight, the computer will decide to play nice and we'll get to watch something worthwhile.  And, the choice has now increased.

 	 Today I was bored... 
So I made a photoblog.  But I deleted it because limited space is not for a hoarder to deal with and I don't have the money to be paying for luxuries like blogs.
I also managed to get to the good part of my current book and am surprised I made it as far as half way because the first half has been pretty naff.
And tonight I plan on sitting in front of a movie with a very big glass of pepsi twist.  Catwoman, Wimbledon or 13 Going on 30?  Now why oculdn't Be Cool have finished downloading yet?

A job that I loved but didn't get.  A job that I like enough to take but probably won't get.  Jobs to apply for thinning out now.  At times I'm starting to lose hope.
Looking for virtual and serviced offices in all sort of places, all of them far too expensive for what Yuri'd be paying for.  
Tommy seems to have gotten better, cleverer, almost over night.
And bad news too.

Today we trekked up Rye Lane to get one of these
because Tommy kept pulling the DVDs out of their carrier bags and spreading the across the floor.  Not that it'll stop him from pulling them off the shelves but at least, as it's kept in the corner, the mess can be contained.  It's also meant that we could get rid of the big plastic box under the bed.  
We still ahve to do something, although I don't know what, with those stones.  Today he progressed from simply picking them up off the floor to actually eating them.  I was not impressed.  Neither was he when I took one out of his mouth.
The simplest, but by no means the easiest or cheapest, would be to move out.  Soon, please, soon.

I met another recruitment consultant today in Cafe Nero in Clapham.  I like it when they buy me coffee.  It somehow makes them seem marginarlly less slimy!
Again, this one was a nice suprise.  There wasn't really much he could say about the role but he spent around an hour coaching me on exactly how I could get through the interview (and any other sales role iterview for that matter).  And all this before he's even put my CV through to the company.  
I managed to pick up some really useful tips and have some good ideas for things I need to look at further.  All at a nice time really as I have an interview of in Surrey Quays on Tuesday.

Thanks to everyone for all the good lucks (and sweeties!).
I got a job yesterday.  The thing is, I'm going to turn it down.  The job itself seems really good (lettings administration) but I have a few reservations about the company and it's only part-time and I'm looking for something full-time.  
In addition to the good interview yesterday, I also had a complete time waster.  I went in to this company only to have the owner read my CV for the first time in front of me (he'd only had it for a week) and go on to tell me that he was only looking for someone with estate agency experience.  I was non too impressed, especially as I'd made the effort to walk over there in shoes that were killing me.
And I had another time waster this morning.  At least this one had read my CV but it appeared that I was only in there to proove I looked presentable.  I'm going to start sending a suited picture of myself alongside my CV.  The guy doesn't exactly fill me with confidence either.  He phoned me less than three hours later to say that he didn't appear to have a copy of my CV, despite the fact that he sat there for ten minutes writing vague notes on it.  Hardly looking hopeful on that account.
I was planning to go home at that point but I managed to get another interview arranged early afternoon so off I went.  A lovely agency who after working out exactly what I was looking for started rooting through files and phoning up people whilst I was still in their office.  I was highly impressed.  
My last interview was with an estate agency specific recruiter.  Both of the guys I spoke to had previously worked within agencies and were really helpful.  We went over exactly what my home circumstances were and what I was looking for and they really managed to get a good plan of what I was looking for in a company.  They advised me against purusing a career with a few companies if I ever want to see home for more than six hours a night and mentioned a few they could contact that would really fit in with Tommy.  They also said they had a few admin roles with leads into higher profile roles at a later date which were a good idea to apply for to get a good grounding in the industry.  I also came away feeling like I might have a chance of them finding something.
I also took the opportunity to have lunch at Brasil by Kilo.  And it was awful.  Limited choice of food, fairly tasteless and poor quality.  Not at all what I'd expected.  I think I'll stick to the pai de queijo next time.

I'm nervous as hell about the second interview I have tomorrow.  I really want that job.  
Vera gave me a bag on the weekend and it's not overly large but large enough to fit a book in.  At least I'll be able to keep my mind occupied whilst I'm on the bus all day long.

This flat is not a very Tommy-proof one.  In fact,  think the owner had some very designer/changing rooms aspirations.  That's not to say I don't like it, I do.  It's just not very Tommy proof.  
There's circular mirrors all over the place.  Luckily, the majority of them are out of Tommy's reach.  It's a good job the stairway is blocked off from him because at the top of it there's tons, stretching from the top of the wall to the bottom.
Then there were the rugs.  Circular (again) splodges of red fluff which seemed to shed every time someone walked over them.  Perfect for little fingers to spread around the house (and eat).  And the colour-scheme.  White walls (which we seem to be getting away with), white sofas (! ouch, I hear you cry!), beige carpets.  Yes, this colour scheme is not designed for any of us here, let alone babies.  Did I mention the full length paper lamps?
But, the piece de resistance is in the living room.  There's a gorgeous fireplace (which I'm still trying decide whether it's an original) which Tommy likes to hold on to whilst standing up and then proceed to remove the grate by rocking back and forth pulling it as hard as he can.  But, that's not the best of it.  That you can find either side.  From both sides of the fireplace extending to the walls oneither side of the room there are pebbles.  White pebbles.  Chalk-like pebbles.  They've not been glued down and they're accesible to all.  Especially overly curious babies who like to have their hands in everything.  
Up until this weekend we've been quite good at keeping Tommy away from them.  The mess level (or I should say, Chris' seeming inability to unpack properly and leaving larges boxes over the living room) has been a convenient barrier.  But, with the family coming round last Friday the roo had to be tidied up.  And the pebbles were uncovered.  
We put a board over most of one side and put a table with a computer on top.  That at least stops little fingers lifting the board up but there's still the matter of a small strip of pebbles right up against the wall.  The oter side is blocked off with a small cupboard and the TV being in the way.  Add to the equation a large amount of toys and it seemed to be fairly inaccessible.  No such luck.  
Today Tommy woke up with an air of cheekiness and he was determined to play with those pebbles.  He managed to get under the desk and past all the cables right to the back of that board.  And, he managed to get past those toys on both sides of the TV.  Even when one of his toys was placed so close to the TV no-one would've imagined he's be able to get to the pebbles, he wormed his way through the smallest of gaps.  The best of it was his cheeky smile that clearly told us he knew he wasn't behving like he was supposed to and didn't really care less.  He just kept trying.
I think we're going to have to come up with a new strategy for this one.

Yesterday Tommy was in a foul mood.  Then Yuska and Marcus came over.  I guess you could say that he's a bit wary of the two of them.  It's not like he sees them a lot.  
But, yesterday he really was showing who he did and didn't like.  He would just about tolerate Yuska but Marcus only had to look at hi and he's start screaing like he was about to be murdered.  To make things worse, Marcus kept being really loud and idiotic (even more so than usual) to try and cheer him up and it only made him cry louder.  
Considering that round here no-one thinks particularly highly of Marcus, it was quite amusing really.
And today, because it's a lovely day we took Tommy to the park and let him crawl around on the grass.  He didn't really go too far unless Yuri was holding him up and helping him walk but he seemed to have a good time.
