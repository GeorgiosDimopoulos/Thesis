The mIRC FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions and Answers) helps you to solve virtually all setup and install problems you could encounter with mIRC.

It includes a tutorial on Aliases, Popups and on 'programming' the Tools/Remote section. We suggest you download the FAQ, it is only 86Kb small.

mIRC 5.91 - 16 bit, for Windows 3.1 and 3.11
mIRC 5.91 was the last version that came in both a 32 and a 16 bit issue. Over the past years less and less people were using the 16 bit issue. All current Windows versions work with the 32 bit issue. There are no configurations left that demand for the 16 bit issue on Windows 95 and above. Old 16 bit winsocks do not exist anymore. These considerations made us stop development of the 16 bit mIRC issue. The 16 bit mIRC 5.91 cabinet is named mirc591s.exe (16bit, 1070080). You can still download this older version from the locations in the list below.
