Wow.  
Eight more days. I have to get this blog up to date by then! I'm leaving for home on Monday, the 14th to see my grandparents, my parents, pack and the sorts. Then my parents are bringing me to the airport for the flight that leaves at 4:50 on St. Patty's day. I also got my Easter Break plans figured out. My friend Susanna (she graduated from high school with me and was my cousin's foreign exchange student) and her family have invited me over to Berlin. I'm excited! Although, it took some trouble getting the plane ticket as I found out I should not be allowed to book tickets. Let's just say it was a $200 life lesson. O my. But yeah. One more weekend of Eurospring workshops and then I'm outta Btown for 2 months...and then I get to move into the new house! yay!Well, I'm outie...I've got to get this blog in shape but it won't be tonight...*yawn* posted by andi at 11:39 PM |&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppostCount('111035424817946110');

the first letter  
To: All 2005 BSU Eurospring participantsFrom: Louise Mengelkoch, Academic DirectorHello everyone! I wanted to make contact with you early in the semester togive you an idea of what to expect during the next few months before ouroverseas adventure. I'm so excited and I'm sure you are too!The first upcoming event (which is very soon!) is the annual visit of Dr.Allan Chapman, our main lecturer at Oxford University. If you haven'texperienced a Chapman lecture yet, you're in for a real treat. (Even if youhave, you're still in for a treat!) His public lecture is Monday, Sept. 20at 3 p.m. in HS 100. Even if you have a class at that time, most professorsare happy to excuse you for this event. Some of them even take their entireclass to Chapman's talk. I hope to see you there. Please find me andintroduce yourself. I'd love to meet all of you as soon as possible.Beginning about mid-October we'll be meeting 3-4 times before semesterbreak. We'll be spending time on logistics, such as registration, passports,etc., but also academic preparation. These meetings are a part of thepre-trip workshop, for which you will receive academic credit and receive agrade for spring semester. We hope to get full participation. With that inmind, I'd like to hear from each of you regarding your fall schedule. I'mconsidering 4 meetings (2 hours each time) on weekday evenings. My scheduleallows me to meet any evening but Wednesdays. Would you please respond andlet me know which evenings would work for you (or late afternoons).This is going to be the experience of a lifetime and I look forward toenjoying it with each one of you. Hope your fall semester is starting offwell, and I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.Regards,--Louise Mengelkoch posted by andi at 8:48 AM |&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppostCount('109465856635164379');
