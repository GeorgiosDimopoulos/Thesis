You might wonder how such a good thing could get better... as of August 2001 we introduce "ChemSketch 5.0 Freeware". Now you can generate the systematic IUPAC name for small molecules, export structures in Chemical Markup Language (CML) format, convert SMILES strings to structures and structures to SMILES, and design input forms for ChemBasic programs with the Forms Manager feature. If you want to access the I-Lab site automatically (so that you have instant on-line access to ACD/Labs prediction modules), then download and install ACD/I-Lab Add-on for ChemSketch . Install the I-Lab Add-on as directed, then draw your molecule in ChemSketch 5.0, click on the I-Lab button and your input molecule will be immediately sent to the Interactive Lab for any number of predictions: NMR spectra, log P and pK a , IUPAC name generation, and so on. With the I-Lab Add-on for ChemSketch, you can also gain access to the previously predicted and stored NMR spectra using included HNMR and CNMR Viewers.
