NOT THE GRAND HOTEL
I'm spending less time on the blog and more time on the gnovel (number one priority for this year) but the Egypt travelogue is by no means finished. Natalie is complaining that I haven't mentioned her in my report. She says she's the one who was Hatshepsut, not me, because a cartoon can't be reincarnated. Oh but you're wrong, I reply. In ancient Egypt the Ba, an entity somewhat similar to what we call soul, was a cartoon and could assume various forms. I was Hatshepsut's cartoon soul, obviously, and still am. But to keep N quiet, below is a pic of her in our hotel room with a bottle of Barak, the local mineral water. Yes, she did come along on this journey but you already knew that, didn't you?

HATSHEPSUT'S OBELISK AND A REFLECTION ON SELF-ESTEEM 
To end today's rumination here is a great quote I found at Esther's naturally nice blog:
Start by doing what's necessary, then what's possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible. (St. Francis of Assisi)
