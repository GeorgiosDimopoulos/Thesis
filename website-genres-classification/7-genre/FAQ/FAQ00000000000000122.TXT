3.2 Itemized Deductions/Standard Deductions: Education & Work-Related Expenses
What educational expenses are deductible?
You may be able to deduct work-related educational expenses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040, line 20. To be deductible, your expenses must be for education that: 
* Maintains or improves skills required in your present job; or 
* Serves a business purpose and is required by your employer, or by law or regulations, to keep your present salary, status, or job. 
Certain restrictions also apply. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses.

What are types of educational expenses?
Deductible educational expenses include amounts spent for tuition, books, supplies, laboratory fees, and similar items. They also include the cost of correspondence courses, as well as formal training and research you do as part of an educational program. Transportation and travel expenses to attend qualified educational activities may also be deductible. For more information, refer toPublication 970 , Tax Benefits for Education; and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses.

Can I deduct the cost of classes I need for work?
In some cases, you may be able to deduct the cost of classes you need for work. This deduction, however, would be subject to the 2 percent of AGI floor, along with most other miscellaneous deductions you list on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. 
To be deductible, your expenses must be for education that:
(1) Maintains or improves skills required in your present job, or
(2) Serves a business purpose and is required by your employer, or by law, to keep your present salary, status, or job. 
However, these same expenses are not deductible if:
(1) The education is required to meet the minimum educational requirements of your job, or 
(2) The education is part of a program that will lead to qualifying you in a new trade or business. 
Educational expenses, related to your present work, that are incurred during periods of temporary absence from your job may also be deductible provided you return to the same job or same type of work. Generally, absence from work for one year or less is considered temporary. 
For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses.

Am I eligible to claim both my job education expenses (minus 2% of AGI) and the Lifetime Learning Credit on my taxes?
If you are eligible to deduct educational expenses and are also eligible for the lifetime learning credit, then it is possible to claim both, as long as you do NOT use the SAME educational expenses to claim both benefits. Your expenses must be divided between the two. This is sometimes desirable because a qualifying expense for one benefit may not be a qualifying expense for the other tax benefit. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; Form 8863 (PDF), Education Credit (Hope and Lifetime Learning Credit); and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses.

I am employed as a Registered Nurse and am currently taking classes to be an Advanced Practitioner of Nursing (which is a master's Degree in Nursing). My classes are not required by my employer but they do increase my knowledge to do my job well. I will probably continue working for the same employer when I graduate. Can I claim the cost of tuition, books, travel to the university, etc., as an unreimbursed business expense?
You may be able to claim this deduction as long as the position of Advanced Practitioner of Nursing does not constitute a change of trade or business. If the education merely maintains or improves the skills required in your employment and you merely have a change of duties, your expenses would likely be deductible as job education expenses, subject to certain limitations. However, you should consider the relative merits of taking a tax deduction versus taking a tax credit (the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits) for the same expense. For more information on the Education Credits, including the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits, refer to Publication 970 , Tax Benefits for Education . For more information on deducting education expenses, refer to Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses ; and Instructions for Form 2106, Employee Business Expenses

I took an accounting course in order to keep my salary on my current job. My employer did not reimburse me for the expenses. Can I take a deduction on my tax return for the cost of the course?
If you itemize deductions you may be able to deduct work-related educational expenses as job expenses which, when combined with your other miscellaneous deductions, are subject to the 2% of adjusted gross income limitation on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. To be deductible, your expenses must be for education that: 
* Maintains or improves skills required in your present job, or 
* Serves a business purpose and is required by your employer, or by law, to keep your present salary, status, or job. 
Your expenses are not deductible if the education is required to meet the minimum educational requirements of your job or is part of a program that will lead to qualifying you in a new trade or business. For more information on deductible educational expenses, refer to Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses; orPublication 970 Tax Benefits for Education;, and Instructions for Form 2106, Employee Business Expenses.

My employer is including my graduate school tuition reimbursements on my W-2. Where do I claim these education expenses on my Form 1040?
If your graduate school tuition is deductible and the reimbursements are included in your income as wages, you may take the expense as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions, line 20. You may also need to attach Form 2106 (PDF), Employee Business Expenses. For more information, refer to Publication 970Tax Benefits for Education; Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses; and Form 2106 (PDF), Employee Business Expense.

Is the exclusion from income of up to $5,250 of employer-provided educational assistance under a qualified program still available?
Yes. For courses beginning before 2002 it applied only to benefits you receive for undergraduate courses. Beginning with the year 2002, employer-provided educational assistance includes graduate level courses. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.

How do I claim an educational expense on my return?
Employees, generally, must complete Form 2106 (PDF), Employee Business Expense or Form 2106-EZ (PDF), Unreimbursed Employee Business Expense, when job-related educational expenses are involved. Educational expenses are deducted as miscellaneous deductions, on line 20, Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. Alternatives to educational expense deductions should also be considered, such as the Lifetime Learning and Hope Credits, as discussed in Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education. 
Self-employed individuals include educational expenses as deductions on Form 1040 Schedule C (PDF), Profit or Loss From Business; Form 1040, Schedule C-EZ (PDF) , Net Profit from Business; or Form 1040, Schedule F (PDF), Profit or Loss from Farming.

I have a child attending a private Catholic grade school. Is any or all of the tuition I pay deductible or a tax credit?
Other than a medical deduction for tuition in the case of a special school for physical or mental disability, tuition for primary or secondary education is neither deductible as an educational expense nor as a charitable contribution, and there are no tax credits for the tuition. You cannot take a charitable deduction for tuition, or for amounts you pay instead of tuition, even if you pay them for children to attend parochial schools or qualifying nonprofit day-care centers. You also cannot deduct any fixed amount you may be required to pay in addition to the tuition fee to enroll in a private school, even if it is designated as a "donation." For more information, refer to Publication 526 , Charitable Contributions. 
Starting in 2002, you can use distribution from a Coverdell Education Savings Account (formerly, Education IRA) for primary school tuition if other requirements are met. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; and Tax Topic 310 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts.

I will be homeschooling my child next year and would like to know if school related expenses, such as curriculum, school supplies, field trip activities, etc., are deductible?

If your child is diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder ADD and cannot function in a public school setting and must be sent to a private school, can the cost of the private school be deducted from your taxes?
The expense would not be deductible as an education or a child care expense. The facts and circumstances will determine if the cost of the private school qualifies as a medical expense. 
Under limited circumstances, you may be able to treat as medical expenses all or part of the tuition or fees you pay to a special school for a child who has severe learning disabilities caused by mental or physical impairments, including nervous system disorders. Refer to Publication 502, Medical and Dental Expenses. Your doctor must recommend that the child attend the school, and the main reason for using the school must be its resources for relieving the disability.

Can I take a deduction for the interest I paid on my student loan?
Starting in 1998, taxpayers who have taken out qualified loans to pay certain costs of attending an eligible educational institution for themselves, their spouse, or their dependent are allowed to take a deduction from gross income for the interest they paid on these student loans. Prior to 2002, deduction of student loan interest was limited to the first 60 months of required interest payments, and, was subject to income limitations. Beginning in 2002, interest paid over any period of time on a qualified education loan is deductible. There are also income limits. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; and Tax Topic 456, Student Loan Interest Deduction.

What are the limits for deducting interest paid on a student loan?
The maximum deductible interest on a qualified student loan is $2,500 per return. If you are a taxpayer whose return status is married filing jointly, you are allowed to deduct the full $2,500 only when your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is $100,000 or less. If your MAGI is between $100,000 and $130,000, the amount of your student loan interest deduction is gradually reduced. The instructions for Form 1040 (PDF) show you how to compute the deduction. If your MAGI is $130,000 or more, you are not able to take any deduction. 
For those whose filing status is single, head of household, or qualifying widow(er), the full $2,500 deduction is allowed for MAGI levels equal to or below $50,000. For MAGI between $50,000 and $65,000, the deduction amount is phased out, and computation instructions are provided in the Instructions for Form 1040. If your MAGI amount is, $65,000 or more, there is no deduction. 
There is no deduction if you file as married filing separately, if you are claimed as a dependent, or if the loan is from a related party or a qualified employer plan. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education ; Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense ; and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses .

The deduction is limited to $2,500 per return for tax year 2001 and beyond. If you file as "married filing separately," there is no deduction. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

I am a parent repaying a loan for my daughter's college education. The loan is a parent's loan taken out in my name. Is the interest deductible on my tax return?
If your daughter was your dependent when you received the loan, the interest you paid on the loan is deductible, provided all other requirements are met. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense; and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expense.

My mother borrowed money for my college education. Now that I'm out of school, I make the monthly payments, but the loan is under her name. Can I take the student loan interest deduction since I'm actually making the payments?
You will not be able to take a deduction for the student loan interest that you pay because you are not the one obligated to pay on the loan. However, your mother may take the deduction, provided all other requirements for the deduction are met. The payment made by you is treated as a gift to her, and then a payment by her. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense; and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses.

Last year, my parents took out a student loan for me in their name and I also took out a student loan. My parents received Form 1098-E for their loan and I also received Form 1098-E for my loan. Can we both claim the interest from the loans on our tax returns? Last year, I was not their dependent.
In order for a taxpayer to claim a deduction for student loan interest, the loan must be incurred for the taxpayer, the taxpayer' spouse, or a person who was the taxpayer's dependent when the taxpayer took out the loan. Since you were not your parents' dependent when they took out the student loan, the interest they paid on the loan does not qualify for deduction. However, the student loan interest payments you made on the student loan you took out on your behalf are eligible for deduction, provided all the other requirements are met. For more information, refer to Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education; Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense; and Tax Topic 513, Educational Expenses.

Generally, you must use Form 2106 (PDF), Employee Business Expenses, or Form 2106-EZ (PDF), Unreimbursed Employee Business Expenses, to claim a deduction for employee business expenses. Your deductible expense is then taken on line 20 of Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF) , as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, subject to the 2% of adjusted gross income floor.

I moved to a different state to accept a new job. Will I be able to deduct all of my moving expenses?
When moving expenses coincide closely with a job transfer or the start of a new job, some of those expenses may qualify for deduction as an adjustment to income on Form 1040 (PDF), U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. You must have moved far enough, and, generally, closer to your new job than you were before you moved. You must have started and kept full-time work for a specific period after the move. Not all moving expenses are deductible. Deductible expenses are generally limited to one-way transportation, including lodging, of your household members along the most direct route to your new residence, and transportation, parking and storage of household goods. You cannot deduct a reimbursed expense, unless the reimbursement has been counted in your wages. For more information, refer to Publication 521, Moving Expenses; Tax Topic 455, Moving Expenses; and the Instructions for Form 3903 (PDF), Moving Expenses.
