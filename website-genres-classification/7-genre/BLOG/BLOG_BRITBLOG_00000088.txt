More yarn!  
I've been to the hospital today and have had some icky tests done. Not much fun, but everything went just fine so I decided to treat myself some yarn! There's always a reason for a treat, isn't there? :-)Anyway, here's the yarn!The lilac that I have already started to make a swatch of is for Bunny A Long, I'll make the Easy Bunny from HeartStrings. You'll probably see it finished tomorrow or the day after.The white yarn I will use to make a scarf with slipped stitches. I'll dye it this week I think. I haven't decided what colour yet tho, I'll probably decide when I get to dyeing the yarn.The Regia yarn, hmmmm.... I dunno! Probably socks for myself but I am not sure yet.Before I start the scarf or the socks I have to finish the baby cardy that I'm working on. I don't like having too many projects on the go at the same time, I think two or three is quite alright!Better get back to bunnyknitting! :-)

needles  
I like needles.Knitting needles that is. I haven't made up my mind yet though whether I prefer bamboo needles to metal needles. Here's my needle collection:There's a mix of new metal needles, old metal needles, cheap bamboo needles and dearer bambo needles. My nana gave me some of her Inox metal needles, both single and double pointed needles. They're great. The Inox ones are blue and I just have to go look for some more of those because thay're very nice to knit with. November last year I bought a set of bamboo needles for a very small cost. It was seven pairs of bamboo needles (between 3 and 6 mm) and they came in a nice flowery case.However, the needles weren't that good so I decided to buy another pair of bamboo needles that costed about half the price of the set of seven pairs. They're definitely worth every single penny! They are the needles you can see to the left of the flowery case. To the right and above the case you see my fave metal needles and dpns. Both sets come from nana. My fiancé has promised to help me sand the cheap bamboo needles and wax them so they become as smooth as I want them to be. Maybe it'll be a project for the summer...If my fiancé can't sort out the needles it's not that big a deal. At least I got a nice needle case :-) I've learnt that I should feel the needles before I pay for them. I've found another LYS in town where I can return the needles if I don't like them after having tried them at home! Great, isn't it? About cases for needles, I've found this website with beautiful cases and I'd love to get a case from there but they're a bit dear, aren't they? http://www.knitknack.com/bagscases/jpbknc.htmOn the same website they have some awsome needles. I'd love to get hold of their Exotic Wood Needles for $54 for a pair. Look here http://www.knitknack.com/needles/glass.htm
My neck has finally stopped aching so now I can go back to knitting after having had six days off! It's been a long wait, I can tell you that :-)

piccies and progress  
I've added some links and some pictures to the blog. I've listed the finished objects in its own place in the side bar, and the list will be updated whenever there's a new finished object. I also have a list for ongoing projects and another list for things I want to knit. However, I can bet on it that that list will change quite a lot so I don't know if it is of any idea to have such a list as I can get an idea one day and then the other day it doesn't feel as interesting :-)What I got on the needles at the moment is this hooded baby cardyI have done the back piece and started on one of the front pieces. I haven't done much colour knitting so far so I thought it'd be fun to knit some stripes. Also, after having finished my first jumper I thought it would be a good idea to start on something smaller.. The jumper took me ages to finish! Maybe because I knitted two pairs of socks in the meantime! :-) I was quite bored with it so my mother, the avid knitter, offered to sew it together for me. If she wouldn't have offered the help I bet the jumper would have been lying in a cupboard for a year or two! My mother tells me to stick to one project so I'll get them finished but I don't believe I'll never be able to do that. I started the baby cardy perhaps two weeks ago but I've found something else that feels more tempting than the baby cardy and that is a spring scarf for myself. I saw a scarf made by Barbro (there's a link for Barbros stickning under Swedish links) that I liked a lot. It's made of cotton yarn and and has slipped stitches ever so often. Just have to find some yarn to make it! Maybe I'll go shopping today...

diary of a knitknit  
Hi!My fiance told me to start a blog about my knitting as that is what I tend to spend a lot of time doing. He's recently started to call me knitknit, thereof the name of the blog.I started knitting November last year and I've found it to be very good for stress reduction. It is also incredibly fun to create knitted items that loved ones can wear!I have one problem though with the knitting and that is that I get a neck ache whenever I've knitted too much. This week I haven't been able to knit at all :-( I suppose I'll find a good position to knit in when I get more used to knitting, I'm still a knitting newbie.I'll be posting more here during the weekend, hopefully with pictures of finished, on-going and future projects.See you soon!
