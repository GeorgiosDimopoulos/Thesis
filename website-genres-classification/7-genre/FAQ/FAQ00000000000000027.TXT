   Subject: C6) Should I tape my windows when a hurricane threatens? 
No, it is a waste of effort, time, and tape. It offers little strength to the glass and NO protection against flying debris. After the storm passes you will spend many a hot summer afternoon trying to scrape the old, baked-on tape off your windows (assuming they weren't shattered). Once a Hurricane Warning has been issued you would be better off spending your time putting up shutters over doors and windows. Back to Tropical Cyclones Myths Page | Back to Main FAQ Page
