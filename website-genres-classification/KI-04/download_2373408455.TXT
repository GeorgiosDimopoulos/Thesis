Download Winamp!

To broadcast SHOUTcast streams, although Winamp version 2.05 and above are capable of broadcasting SHOUTcast streams, we recommend you get the latest version 2.x. The reason we recommend the latest version is due to the fact, as time progresses, new features are added to better accomodate DJs as well as add further functionality to SHOUTcast. In order to take advantage of those features, you would need the newest versions of all the files that enable SHOUTcast support in Winamp. Note that the SHOUTcast DSP does not currently work with Winamp 3.x.	 
Download the SHOUTcast DSP Plug-In for Winamp 2.x

In order to broadcast to a running SHOUTcast server, you will need the SHOUTcast Source for Winamp 2.x DSP Plug-in, a piece of software which adds SHOUTcast broadcast ability to the Winamp 2.x software. The DSP Plug-in acts as a bridge between your Winamp software and a SHOUTcast DNAS server (which you or a friend need to be running to broadcast). To obtain the latest copy of the plugin, please click here. [filesize - 225k] Instructions are included with the installer.

Complying with copyright laws

Musical compositions and sound recordings are creative works that are protected by the copyright laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) and other countries. Under U.S. law, the owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to (and to authorize others to) reproduce the work, use parts of the work in a new creation, distribute the work in whole or in part, and to publicly display or perform the work (including on web pages and through webcasting). With few exceptions, it is illegal to reproduce, distribute or broadcast a sound recording without the permission of the copyright owner. It is your responsibility to comply with the copyright laws when you become a webcaster. 

There have been recent amendments to the copyright law regarding webcasting of sound recordings. These new provisions allow webcasting under the terms of a statutory license, as a way to help webcasters get permission without having to go to each sound recording's owner. The statutory license, however, has strict requirements that you must follow. Some of these requirements include the payment of license fees, limitations on the number of songs from the same album or artist that may be played in a three hour period (called the sound recording performance complement); a prohibition on publishing advance playlists; and a requirement to identify the song, artist and album on the website. There are other requirements as well. The Recording Industry Association of America provides quite a bit of information on copyright law as it applies to webcasting, and both ASCAP and BMI have created license agreements that they are willing to grant to webcasters that they believe conform to the provisions of the new copyright rules for webcasting. For additional information on the statutory license and other aspects of webcasting, please visit the following sites: 

* The U.S. Copyright Office 
* The Recording Industry Association of America - particularly http://www.riaa.com/weblic/weblic.htm 
* ASCAP - particularly http://www.ascap.com/weblicense/webintro.html
