At the moment, I have two pet peeves that are really irritating me.  So why not air my aggravation in the lounge among friends?

1) Why don't computers know how to count?   With all this processing power, our file name sorts still don't know that 10 comes after 9 and not between 1 and 2.  Likewise for 11, 100, 110, etc.  What's the deal?

2) Why don't people who fly in airplanes understand that it's not right to sit with your knees spread so far apart that one extends half-way into your neighbor's seat space?  And why do those same ... inconsiderate people ... think it's acceptable to stick their giant arms and elbows past their side of the arm rest?  They didn't pay for half of my ticket and they're not entitled to half of my seat - dang it!!                       

Ok.  I feel a little better now that I got that off my chest.

Thanks.

Why don't people realize you're supposed to be quiet in a theater?

Why do people call a PocketPC a Palm?

Why doesn't UPS deliver all their regular services on Saturday like the US Post Office?

Why did Freaks and Geeks get cancelled?

Why does McDonald's have the best fries, Burger King the best burgers and Jack in the Box the best ads?

Why would anyone want to watch a movie in Full Screen?

 

OK, that's all for now.

Why do banks prop the vault door open and chain down the pens?

Why do gasoline prices go up when oil prices go down?

Why is the free coffee at the lumber yard better than the coffee you buy at the convenience stores.

Why is education so much more interesting when you are no longer in school?

I've got another peeve to add to the list:

PocketPC software vendors who do not fully support installation to a storage card when there's no good reason not to!!  

I understand that some utilities have to be installed in main memory.  I'm not talking about them.  

I'm mostly talking about games vendors.  There is no reason in the world why I shouldn't be able to install a game to the storage card and have all its files, dll's, and whatever else they need installed on the storage card!  I'm sick of having my windows folder littered with game-specific dll's, sucking down my precious main memory when I have loads of CF space available.  Some games install to the storage card, mostly, but then don't work.

To all those half-..donkey... game packages that create a storage card folder and then install in main memory any way or install partially to the storage card and litter my windows folder with their specific dll's, I say ...

Let me repeat that:

By the way ... I'll NEVER buy your stupid game if you needlessly litter my main memory. 

And another thing ... 

Whew! - Glad I got that out.  It was starting to hurt.

* People for whom you hold open a door, who then stroll right through without a word to you, as if you are their (under)paid servant.
 

 

* Sitting on the floor in a large department store, opening all of those wrapped Christmas presents, and finding out that every single one of them was empty.
 

 

* Lawyers.
