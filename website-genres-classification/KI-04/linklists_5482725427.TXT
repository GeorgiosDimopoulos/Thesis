But in terms of the places where we live or work, unwanted moisture means erosion, corrosion and rot! This mini web-class can help anyone who cares for, or about, a historic house to better understand and deal with the three most common sources of the "wet stuff". We'll show you how it invades historic materials; what goes wrong when moisture is not adequately managed; and how to turn the corner on present and future problems by providing some simple, common sense tips. Then, after you've read everything, take a short quiz to see if you're still "All Wet!" American Defenders of Land, Sea & Sky Travel through time and across country to 56 special places in our nation's past--National Historic Landmarks that hold fascinating stories of America's "common defense." Begin with the first shots of the Revolutionary War and "follow history" to the War of 1812, the Struggle for Western Territory, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, two World Wars, and the Cold War. Visit forts, battle sites, old ships and planes, a modern submarine, and a pioneering space vehicle! See special places where peace treaties were signed; view monuments that honor those who have been lost to war. Links to a Guide for Teachers, Parents, and Other Educators. Checklist for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings This series of questions in a "checklist" format has been designed to help anyone who is considering the rehabilitation of a historic building. Electronic Rehab This popular web class should be useful for anyone interested in learning more about the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, but was designed especially for historic building owners; new members of design review and historic preservation commissions; architects, contractors, and developers; maintenance personnel and others involved in the care of historic buildings; and students in historic preservation courses. Features two quizzes. From the Roof Down and Skin Deep The "skin" of a historic house includes the roof, chimney, exterior walls, woodwork, windows, porches, doors, and above-ground portion of the foundation. Since the "skin" serves as the primary defense against the weather, regular maintenance and repair are critically important. In this distance learning program, you'll learn how the various parts of your historic house were tightly connected when it was built; how to keep surfaces and features in good repair over time; and what happens if you don't. Includes a Quiz! Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) Gallery of Measured and Interpretive Drawings This online gallery of drawings captures the structural, operational, and contextual significance of nationally and regionally significant engineering and manufacturing sites.

Discover the basic issues that often arise when rehabilitating historic buildings for continuing or new uses. Ten projects met the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for rehabilitation, while ten did not. Telling Historic Preservation Time This web guide demonstrates that historic preservation clocks don't move in quite the same way that the normal one does. What's different about these interpretive and seemingly arbitrary "clocks" is that they can be temporarily stopped through Preservation; moved forward through Rehabilitation; moved backward through Restoration; or re-started through Reconstruction. It is these ideas about time that constitute the philosophical framework for historic preservation treatments. The Good Guides! These guides cover all aspects of caring for historic buildings--from choosing appropriate treatments to actually doing the work in ways that meet historic preservation standards. Both the popular classics and brand new web offerings are easily accessible.

America's Hidden Battlefields: Protecting the Archeological Story 
America's battlefields teach us about some of the most important events in our history--and there is much more to a battlefield than immediately meets the eye! An important piece of this irreplaceable landscape is the reality of that long-ago battle that lies hidden underground. Through the protection, study, and interpretation of archeological evidence, we can enhance our understanding of those events, and ensure that the battle itself is remembered.
