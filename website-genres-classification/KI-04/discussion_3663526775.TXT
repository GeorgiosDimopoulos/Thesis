---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hello! I got an electric pressure cooker. I would like to try cooking a 6.04 pound turkey breast (with the bone). How long should I cook it and do I brown it as best I can in the pressure cooker? The cooker is a 6 qt. If so, I think I would have to brown it in some other type of pan as the breast seems to just fit in this cooker. How much liquid would I add and should it be water? And... any other tips and words of wisdom from you more experienced pressure cookers???!!!

Thanks for the help!
