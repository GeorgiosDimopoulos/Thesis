I made a personal loan of $3,500 to a friend. She declared bankruptcy after only paying me back $500.00. Does the IRS allow any provision for my loss?
If, in a true debtor-creditor relationship, someone owes you money that you cannot collect, you have a bad debt. There are two kinds of bad debts - business and nonbusiness. 
Bad debts are deductible only if the amount owed to you represents a loan of your cash or has been previously included in your income. A business bad debt, generally, is one that comes from operating your trade or business. All other bad debts are nonbusiness. 
Nonbusiness bad debts must be totally worthless to be deductible. You cannot deduct a partially worthless nonbusiness bad debt. You must establish that you have taken reasonable steps to collect the debt and that the debt is worthless. You may take the deduction only in the year the debt becomes totally worthless. A debt becomes totally worthless when there is no longer any chance the amount owed will be paid. You do not have to wait until the debt comes due. A nonbusiness bad debt is taken as a short-term capital loss on Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), Capital Gains and Losses . 
For more information on bad debts, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, and Publication 535, Business Expenses. 
Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), Capital Gains and Losses.

Are the legal fees incurred or paid for collection of Social Security Benefits deductible?

Where are fees and commissions for investments deducted?
If they are deductible, investment expenses other than investment interest are taken as miscellaneous deductions on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. These deductions must be reduced by 2% of your adjusted gross income. 
Commissions and fees for the acquisition or sale of an asset are added to the basis of that asset and are not deductible. For example, acquisition fees, sales commissions, and load charges paid in connection with the purchase or selling of mutual fund shares are not deductible. They can usually be added to the basis of the shares. 
Fees for managing investments, such as custodial fees and management fees, are deductible. Fees you pay a broker to collect taxable bond interest or stock dividends are deductible. Fees that pass through to you from non-publicly offered mutual funds, partnerships, or trusts are deductible. All of these fees are subject to the 2% limit. For more information, refer to Publication 529, Miscellaneous Deductions; Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses; and Publication 564, Mutual Fund Distributions.

Is a real estate investment considered investment property? Is the interest deductible as investment interest if you cannot deduct it as mortgage interest?
If you borrow money and use it to buy property you hold for investment, the interest you pay is deductible as investment interest subject to certain limits. However, you cannot deduct interest you incurred to produce tax-exempt income. Investment interest does not include any qualified home mortgage interest or any interest taken into account in computing income or loss from a passive activity.

We took a margin loan from our investment money market account. Can the interest we paid be deducted?
If you are a cash method taxpayer, you can deduct interest on margin accounts to buy taxable securities as investment interest in the year you pay it. You are considered to have paid interest on these accounts only when you actually pay the broker or when payment becomes available to the broker through your account. Payment may become available to the broker through your account when the broker collects dividends or interest for your account, or sells securities held for you or received from you. You cannot deduct any interest on money borrowed for personal reasons. Investment interest deductions are limited to the extent of investment income. The deductions amount is reported on Form 4952 (PDF), Investment Interest Deduction. The deduction is then taken as an itemized deduction on line 13 of Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. For more information, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.

If I don't itemize my deductions can I still deduct my investment expenses such as margin interest?

How do I deduct and substantiate my gambling losses?
You can deduct gambling losses only if you itemize deductions. Claim your gambling losses as a miscellaneous deduction on line 27 of Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. They are not subject to the 2% limit of your Adjusted Gross Income. The amount of losses you deduct cannot total more than the amount of gambling income you have reported on your return. It is important to keep an accurate diary or similar record of your gambling winnings and losses. To deduct your losses, you must be able to provide receipts, tickets, statements or other records that show the amount of both your winnings and losses. 
The Service provides the following guidelines for proving gambling winnings and losses: 
1. An accurate diary or similar record regularly maintained by the taxpayer, supplemented by verifiable documentation usually is acceptable evidence for substantiation of wagering winnings, and losses. In general, the diary should contain at least the following information: 
* a) date and type of specific wager or wagering activity; 
* b) name of gambling establishment; 
* c) address or location of gambling establishment; 
* d) name(s) of other person(s) present with you at gambling establishment; and 
* e) amount(s) won or lost. 
2. Verifiable documentation includes, but is not limited to, wagering tickets, canceled checks, credit records, bank withdrawals, and statements of actual winnings or payment slips provided by the gambling establishment. When possible, the diary and available documentation generated with the placement and settlement of a wager should be supported by such documentation as hotel bills, airline tickets, gasoline credit cards, or affidavits or testimony from responsible gambling officials regarding the wagering activity. 
For more information refer to Publication 529, Miscellaneous Deductions; and Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.
