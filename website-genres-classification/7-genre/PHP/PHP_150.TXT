Kathleen Carr: Science Writer and Web Designer
=====================================================================
 
Thanks for stopping by my Web site. Based in Tallahassee, Florida, I have been freelance writing, primarily about science, since 1985 for regional and local newspapers and magazines. Currently, I'm doing research for a book about Monk Parakeets.
I have expanded my work to include Web site design and construction and received my Webmaster certification from Florida State University in 1998.
