When you buy Fair Trade goods, you know the people behind the products get a fair deal. Your purchase helps people like Celia Gonzales to benefit from extra income and from community projects like clean water. Ultimately, Fair trade gives producers a secure future, and enables them to do the things that most people take for granted - like sending their children to school. 
The Traidcraft & Oxfam partnership
 Traidcraft and Oxfam GB help small producer groups to develop their businesses and find new markets, giving them independence and potential for growth. Traidcraft works alongside producers worldwide to help them build better lives, and sell many of their products in the UK. Traidcraft and Oxfam have a long history of working together, and through this site, we aim to bring Fair Trade products to as many shoppers as possible. Here we bring you a fantastic selection of Traidcraft food and handicrafts on-line. Happy shopping!
