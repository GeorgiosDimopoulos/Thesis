Welcome to the home page of Chris Nikolopoulos. I am a Professor of Computer Science at Bradley University, in Peoria, Illinois. I have previously taught at Colorado State University, Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan. 
During Spring/Summer of 1994, I was a Visiting Professor with the Department of Computer Science and A.I. at the University of Malta under a Fulbright Senior Scholar grant. For more information on the beautiful island of Malta, please follow the previous link. 
I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Athens, Greece, my M.S. from Michigan State University and Ph.D from Colorado State University. 
My research interests focus on artificial intelligence and databases and include logic programming, expert systems, neural networks and machine learning, genetic algorithms and classifier systems, deductive databases and computer algerbra. 
If you are interested, you can view a list of courses I teach or some of my current research projects or a list of some of my publications. 
Also you can follow the link for information on my BOOK ON EXPERT SYSTEMS.
