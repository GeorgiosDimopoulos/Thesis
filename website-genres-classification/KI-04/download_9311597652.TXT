Nessus is made up of two parts : a server and a client. The server (nessusd) is actually in charge of the attacks, whereas the client is just a frontend designed to collect the results. As of today, there is only one version of the server which works on POSIX systems (Solaris, FreeBSD, GNU/Linux and others), and there are multiple clients : one which works with GTK (the Gimp ToolKit, see the GTK website, others have been written for Win32.

The server is not an option. It performs the security checks.
