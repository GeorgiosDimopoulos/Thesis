Frank Moore's Webpage
Hellllloooo! I am just beginning my third year as a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Nebraska. My research interests are in commutative algebra, in particular the homological algebra of commutative rings, and I am working under the direction of Lucho Avramov. Below are a few neat math links and also links to my notes and homework sets in some of the classes that I have taken. In addition, there are links to the current courses I am teaching.
Schedule
Here is what my course schedule looks like for Summer 2004. As you can see, I have lots of time to read papers this summer!

Courses I Have Instructed
Below is a list of the classes that I have taught. I also tought three Math 106 Recitations last year, but I didn't have a webpage for those classes. I am not teaching this academic year in order to focus on research.
 Class Webpages 
* Math 100A (Fall 2003) 
* Math 100A (Spring 2004) 
Math Links
www.planetmath.org 
Neat startup, especially cool because anyone can contribute and it's open source.
mathworld.wolfram.com 
Also cool, but not open source.
www.commalg.org 
A neat Commutative Algebra site maintained by Graham Leuschke(UNL Alum, University of Syracuse), Sean Sather-Wagstaff (visiting at UNL), and Moira McDermott (Gustavas Adolphus College and has a great mathy site of her own).
Class Notes and Projects
Algebra 901 and 902 (from Lang's Algebra, and a fair bit from Atiyah and Macdonald's Introduction to Commutative Algebra once we were into 902)
Topics in Algebra - Cryptography (from Koblitz's A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography) 
Papers
The papers listed below stem from my honors thesis that I did for my Honors Mathematics degree at the University of Texas at Arlington under the direction of Dave Jorgensen. Eventually I will have links to stuff pertaining to my thesis here, but that is at least a year away. 
Essential intersections and vanishing (co)homology, (with D. Jorgensen) Preprint 
* ps or pdf 
Building Modules with Prescribed Cohomological Support Set, (with D. Jorgensen) Preprint 
* dvi or pdf 
What Springer-Verlag GTM are you?
If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Frank Warner's Foundations of Differentiable Manifolds and Lie Groups.
I give a clear, detailed, and careful development of the basic facts on manifold theory and Lie Groups. I include differentiable manifolds, tensors and differentiable forms. Lie groups and homogenous spaces, integration on manifolds, and in addition provide a proof of the de Rham theorem via sheaf cohomology theory, and develop the local theory of elliptic operators culminating in a proof of the Hodge theorem. Those interested in any of the diverse areas of mathematics requiring the notion of a differentiable manifold will find me extremely useful.
