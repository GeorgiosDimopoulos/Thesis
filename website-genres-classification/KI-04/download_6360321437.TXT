phpBB 2.0.6c :: 31st Dec 2003

phpBB2 is the successor to the highly popular phpBB opensource bulletin board system. Re-written from the ground up to be even more flexible, secure and feature packed than its predecesor. phpBB 2.0 features all that was good about phpBB 1.x; one-click install, multiple language packs, simple and intuitive user interfaces, support for BBCode and powerful administration features. It extends this offering complete customisation through a powerful template system, fulltext based searching, advanced permissions system, powerful modularised administration controls, multiple database support, new moderator functions and much more.

phpBB is released free of charge. However, you must read and fully understand the license agreement before you download and use the software.-+- License Agreement -+-

Thanks

Storage of the phpBB 2.0.0, language, image localisation and convertor packs is courteousy of Sourceforge.net

Language & Image Packs	         
           

phpBB2 has been localised into several languages by a dedicated team of translators. All official packs are listed below, please note that we cannot support language sets downloaded from other sites.       

Installation

To install a language pack simply decompress the downloaded package into the languages/ directory. It will immediately become available to all users.

Do not forget to download the related subSilver package, this contains localised button images for the default subSilver style. These should be decompressed in the templates/ directory. Support for these is automatic when the appropriate language is utilised.

Remember when decompressing the package that you must retain the directory or folder structure. If you are unsure how to do this with your software please check its documentation. Failure to retain the directory structure will result in the language not being available.

New Translations

If your language is not listed below and you have the time please feel free to start a new translation. It is not particularly difficult to do but will take some time. Before starting please first read our Knowledge Base article. There you can find whether an existing person is already working on your language. If not you will also find details of how to go about localising phpBB2.
