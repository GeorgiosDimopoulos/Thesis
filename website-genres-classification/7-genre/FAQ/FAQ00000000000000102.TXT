14.4 Electronic Filing (e-file) and TeleFile: Forms W&#8211;2 & Other Attachments
If I file electronically, what do I do with my W-2 forms?
When filing electronically you must provide Form W-2 (PDF) to the authorized IRS e-file provider before the provider sends the electronic return to the IRS. In addition, you should keep them in a safe place with a copy of your tax return. For general information about e-file, refer to Tax Topic 252, Electronic Filing.
