Monitor question
9 Mar 05
So I have two monitors on my computer, both Mitsubishi Diamond plus 19&#8221; models, with one crucial difference. A few weeks ago I cleaned them both (with Screen Clene no less) and my secondary monitor did this:
&#8220;Arrrgggghhh!&#8221; I said. Or something to that effect anyway. I had partially removed the anti-glare coating from my screen, and now it&#8217;s a complete mess – I&#8217;ve resorted to making windows two thirds the height of that screen so I don&#8217;t have to peer through the scratches&#8230; You can see here how utterly annoying it is:
Anyway, I was looking into a solution tonight and came to one conclusion, I&#8217;m screwed. Basically it seems that there is no way to restore the coating. According to Sony:
The coating cannot be repaired & scratches cannot be removed. (The only cure is replacement).
And although I cannot find official word from NEC-Mitsubishi, I assume the same applies. See, screwed.
Then I had a thought, perhaps I could take the monitor to pieces and remove the anti-glare coating altogether? Sure, the monitor would be too bright, but I don&#8217;t often use it during daylight hours (because I&#8217;m usually staring at my display at work instead), and I could always adjust the brightness right?
So after a little googling I found an article enitled &#8216;How to clean a computer monitor&#8217; which offered this handy tip towards the end:
Absolutely DO NOT use rubbing alchohol if you have a monitor with an anti-glare coating (anything but a really cheap or old one). It will remove the coating. I learned the hard way.
Hrrmmm&#8230;.
Whaddya think, should I give it a go?

I have actually posted my snowboarding holiday photos! Yes, its true, see for yourself!
Unfortunately the gallery script I&#8217;m using doesn&#8217;t allow comments, so you&#8217;ll just have to post here if you have questions (assuming any of you actually care that is&hellip;)
Enjoy, there&#8217;s some good ones in there I think!

Via Boing Boing

Wow, Boing Boing, (a &#8216;directory of wonderful things&#8217; apparently) really is an enormous and utterly brilliant waste of time. Recent things I have seen there include this brilliant t-shirt:
Also very amusing are these pics of Bill Gates (which are real btw), and my favourite of all:
Generally brilliant stuff. Thanks to Olly for ensuring the rest of my life goes down the tubes ;-D
