Zamgwar's Cyber Stop
=====================================================================
 
You've surfed your way to an off ramp of the information superhighway. Why not let that mouse cool down awhile and visit? View this as the electronic equivalent, of taking a detour to see the world's biggest wad of gum. Or stopping to see the two headed cow, while driving to Vegas.
Our Cyber Stop, like the Universe, is ever expanding and constantly in flux, with an overhaul every 45 days or so during the winter. So if you like fluxed up sites, visit often. 
All pages are original and were written right here at The Zamgwar Institute, the nation's leading center for humor research. This site works best with an Internet Explorer Browser..but we're workin on that too!
