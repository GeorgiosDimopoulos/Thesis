PD4J - Is Process Driven Design the next big thing?: According to the published schedule, the final specification for JSR-207, Process Definition for Java (PD4J), will soon be released. For those who now work with Business Processes on a daily basis, this is going to be a godsend, but why should all Java developers take note?

Developments in Nokia-land: Nokia's making some very interesting moves...how will other wireless vendors respond? Bill Day   (January 23, 2004 6:48PM PT) »&nbspDiscuss (3)    » Permalink The 3rd Dimension of Java Freedom: Java is all about freedom. The JVM gives us freedom from being stuck on a particular operating system or a hardware platform. The JCP gives us freedom from being tied to a particular vendor by allowing many implementation choices certified for each approved specification. What most developers miss is that the Java language is capable of giving us the long-term freedom to move from one specification to another with minimal effort. I urge you to not abandon your principals by tying your code to current technologies. Find a way to stay free and make use of the full benefits of the Java platform.

How to style a simple block menu in HTML using CSS: Recently I wanted to create a block menu in my html pages. I want this block menu to have a header indicating the category of the menu and a set of menu items. There may be more than one way of doing this exercise. There may also be a better way of doing the same. But here is how I have done it and it seem to work well for now.

Open Source Developer: Will Work for Food!: The difference between open source developers and commercial developers is the pretty much the same as the difference between a starving fine artist and a fat and happy commercial artist.

John D. Mitchell   (January 21, 2004 11:21AM PT) »&nbspDiscuss ()    » Permalink Testing MVC actions, mock objects and code coverage: Mock objects are the subject of several blogs again this week and they reminded me of a question that several people have asked me.

What's so bad about making it easier to learn Java?: What's all this grumbling about "dumbing down" Java? Is it really so bad to make it easier to learn and develop in Java? Lately, I've found I can divide many folks into two camps: those who hate and fear the "let's get to 10 million" and those who don't. Kathy Sierra   (January 19, 2004 12:55PM PT) »&nbspDiscuss (24)    » Permalink Endorsing a front runner: In political races, candidates drop out and endorse front runners for a variety of reasons.
