# Thesis
Text Categorization is an important study in the field of Text-Mining, with a wide range of
applications. In recent years, through the development of Neural Networks, many techniques
have been developed such as pre-trained language models, which are applicable to Natural
Language Processing (NLP). Currently, the best practice for categorizing texts, e.g. writer
recognition, is the application of Pre-Trained Language Models through Fine-Tuning. In
this research, we analyze and present the application of the Universal Language Model
Fine Tuning technique (ULMFiT) in some text categorization applications, which is developed
by NLP's fast.ai research team. Furthermore, we compare this technique with others, and
we conclude, presenting the results of this comparison.
