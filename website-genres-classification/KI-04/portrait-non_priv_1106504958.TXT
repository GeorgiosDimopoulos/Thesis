The Internet is a global marketplace stocked with legitimate and fraudulent promotions. Prevention of internet scams and internet fraud can start with consumers informing others of unpleasant and regretful experiences.

The Internet Business Consumer Bureau was established to alert those traveling through cyberspace of deceptive companies offering products and services. The IBCB reports information that has been reported to us by consumers that have had an experience with an internet business. There are no memberships.  Our information comes from consumers who report disputes to the IBCB.

Call us before you invest.  For $10 (we accept all major credit cards), you will receive a verbal and written report on a company accompanied by a complaint form in case there should be a dispute.  Complaint information can be faxed or mailed to us. The IBCB will provide you with a listing of the Attorneys General and FTC offices in the U.S.

Protect yourself against sites offering scams. Thousands of users have been abused. Don’t become a victim. Call us today! The IBCB has a live operator available from 9:00am – 5:00pm ET at our toll-free number:
