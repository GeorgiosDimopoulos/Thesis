TODAY'S TOP STORIES 	
Houston's heat wave 
heralds a deadly season 
Texas averages 68 heat deaths per year. Summer's extreme temperatures alone don't usually take lives, but isolation, poverty and the lack of a coordinated effort can combine for tragic results. Critics say no coordinated effort exists to combat heat deaths.
 	
Smiley N. Pool/Chronicle Gloria Mills washes the face of her mother, Leola Brown, at their Houston apartment. Five years after being incapacitated with irreparable brain damage from a heat-related stroke, Brown, 73, remains bedridden. Full story.
