One of my favorite pastimes is fishing. I remember when I had the time to fish. Now I am more of a Dad than anything - and that's good news. Fishing has been replaced by the New Light of My Life . It's a nice trade to spend time with my little Ali-Baba instead of fishing. When she gets old enough - maybe next summer - I'll try to teach her. If she likes it, cool. Update:

Life is tough on kids these days. They get exposed to violence at such an early age. She used to love the kind purple dinosaur named Barney. Now she is really into RugRats and Dexter's Laboratory.
My wife Stephanie is from Hawaii, California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania; I am from Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, and New Jersey. We first met in 1984 at the Psychology Department here at Purdue. She came to study and I was as a research technician, but we didn't become romantically involved until many years later. She has a Bachelor's, a Master's, and a PhD in Psychology with specialization in neuroscience.
Stephanie is now a Research Scientist at Med Institute Inc. and is an educational writer for Rue Educational Publishers.
