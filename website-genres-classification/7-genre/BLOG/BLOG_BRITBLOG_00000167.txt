Open debate, closed conclusion 
The faculty of Harvard's arts and sciences school passed a motion of "lack of confidence" for President Lawrence Summers. The motion came after Summers made controversial statements about why there are fewer women excelling in math and science. Summers argued that he thought that family pressures and biological differences explained the disparity better than socialization and discrimination. Apparently now he should lose his job; or at least that is the impression of many of Harvard's scholars. The vote was 218-185.There is no evidence to prove one way or another that discrimination or biology is the reason for the disparity in math and sciences between men and women. That's why it is controversial, that is the definition of controversy. If it was proven, it would be factual, then it would not be controversial. The world is round. Not a controversial statement. One day it was a controversial statement. Women do not excel in math and science to the extent that men do because of biological differences. That is a controversial statement. One day maybe it will be proven and thus no longer be a controversy. What bothers me is that this criticism is coming from within an academic community that seemingly will support comments of any kind. Ward Churchill's comments were much more hurtful to many, and certainly more unequivocal about their intent, yet his right to free speech has been respected and asserted by so many in academia. Going to one of these elite colleges you hear so much about diversity. You are taught that diversity of thought is what is important. Yet look what happens when an academic asserts the possibility that biological differences between men and women may dictate the subjects that they excel at and their subsequent choice in careers. He said that he was only suggesting the possibility and that he hoped to be disproven. His statement was meant to show the need for further research into the topic. But the egalitarian liberal wing, many of which find a natural habitat in academia (interestingly enough because of the free speech they enjoy there), have found an opportunity to further there platform of "all are equal, in every sense." They attempt to erase the suggestion of inherent differences between people every chance they get. If they can't prove their case with science, they just advance their case by making the statements contrary to their belief unacceptable to voice within earshot of anybody. Why are all NFL players men? Must be because of society. Why are the majority of soldiers in militaries all around the world men? Because of male chauvanistic belief structures that discourage women from pursuing military lifestyles. It is unacceptable to suggest that men dominate the NFL because they are naturally bigger, stronger, and faster than women. It is also unacceptable to suggest that men make up the majority of world wide armed services because men find the prospect of hand to hand combat and killing less distasteful. But these ideas have been around for more than 50 years, that makes them wrong. Would these same Harvard professors voice the same outrage if somebody published a study, or publicly suggested that most serial murderers are white males? Academia argues for the need for open debate when it suits their need. "We need open debate on topic X because of the historic marginalization they have experienced." They use "open debate" as a way to introduce previously unpopular ideas. Once open debate has been established they use it to mean that any statements contrary to their opinion, since it was the previous status quo, is antiquated and discriminatory. Debate is silenced, the conclusion is assumed. If we are going to have open debate about controversial issues we must acknowledge that they are controversial. That means there are two sides. Open debate means the side you disagree with and do not like to hear also has a right to voice their opinion. It is all opinion until proven. If you hear something you don't like, discredit it by legitimate and scientific means; this goes especially for academic institutions who swear by the scientific method. Silencing a critic by making their view point publicly unvoiceable is something that open debate is meant to fight against, and something only authoritarians could be proud of.-MilitantlyAgnostic

Ozmosis 
oz·mo·sis1. The process by which criminal offenders are released back into society and then return back into prisons within three years.A 1994 study showed that 2/3 of prisoners released in 1994 were arrested again within 3 years. Half of the prisoners were back in prison within three years. Are our prisons designed to punish or rehabilitate these criminals? Probably some of both. Unfortunately, when policy is not clearly defined to rehabilitate or punish, but rather is based on the nebulous idea of "a little bit of both" neither are successfully accomplished. Criminals released back into society with misdemeanors and felonies on their record face a number of problems reacclimating back in to society. The least of which is not that they have trouble finding jobs. When a person with no money, and no way of supporting himself, is released from prison and cannot find a job to support himself what will likely happen? He will have to rely on crime to support himself; then it is just a matter of time before he is back in prison. Prison policies should focus on rehabilitating those prisoners who are going to be released into society, and giving them marketable skills with which they can find jobs to support themselves without relying on crime. The last few years have been tough for people trying to find jobs. We all know about the net job loss during the Bush administration. Who do you think is the last person an employer wants to hire during a slow economy when there is an abundance of laborers looking for work? My guess is prison convicts. Lucky for them I can think of four places still hiring. The Marines, Navy, Army, and Air Force.Prisons are notorious for the discipline problems they experience within their walls. The people inside are clearly people with no overabundance of respect for the law, discipline, or in many cases other people. The military is notorious for instilling discipline. The military is also having problems reaching recruiting goals. The other day the Army announced that it did not expect to meet their recruiting goals for the year and the Marines did not reach their goals in January. That was the first time the Marines failed to do so in almost a decade. Prisoners need discipline, the military needs people. Prisoners need marketable skills, the military provides marketable skills. Prisoners need to be integrated, and feel integrated, into mainstream America. Military service instills a sense of belonging.Prisons should allow military recruiters to come onto their grounds and carefully screen prisoners to start an ROTC-like program inside the prison. Prisoners accepted into the program would recieve military training while in prison. Acceptance in to the program would be based on disciplinary records of the inmates. Those with behavioral problems would not be allowed to partake. Ideally the military would provide separate housing for those in the program. This would create a separate living environment for those prisoners who choose to enlist. This would create an environment with higher discipline which would likely cut down on the abusive externalities associated with prison, like rape. Ideally more prisoners would apply for the ROTC program than could be accepted. This would provide a behavioral incentive for all inmates who desired to join the program. This would further cut down on violence and abuse within the prisons. A criminal would enterr prison with two choices: to remain in the general prison population and face the daily risk of violence that prisoners face today; or to join a program that provides separate housing with greater guarantee over their personal safety. I believe most prisoners would choose their personal safety over any prejudices against military service. Unfortunately I think the military is probably too prejudiced against inmates to ever consider such an option.Prisoners should not be allowed to join the program for a designated period so that their behavior could be evaluated. This would give them incentive to behave at the start of their sentence as well as give them a taste of just how bad prison life is. Given an option to leave general population and guarantee personal safety many would likely enlist. The program would always be voluntary, never coerced. The maintenance of a volunteer military is essential, especially in this scenario.As part of the program prisoners would be enlisting for military service for a period of time after their release. I suggest four years, but a minimum of two would probably suffice. There could be other stipulations that would result in differing service times on an individual basis. Prisoners who are eligible for parole based on good behavior could enlist in the program and then have years of their sentence exchanged for years of military service. Obviously many people will have a strong reaction against this idea. It's only an idea. But this would serve an incredibly useful purpose for our society. Twofold. First, it would provide more servicemen for our military. Second, it would provide jobs for prisoners leaving prison. This would give them a guaranteed income and structured lifestyle to keep them from falling back in to a life of crime. I predict that military service would give them a sense of accomplishment also, something many inmates have probably not had much experience with. Politicians would never be able to propose such a plan. They would immediately be killed in the PR world of current politics. Their opponents would be licking their chops. "Politician Whatsherface recently has suggested that we make our criminals mooooooore dangerous. They are clearly out of touch with society and soft on crime." OOF. The soft on crime label. The kiss of death for elected representatives. This is unfortunate. I don't view the plan as making criminals more dangerous. I view the plan as giving criminals more discipline and an opportunity for gainful employment and a chance to start a new life. When policies in place are not working we must look for innovative new solutions, regardless of politics.-MilitantAgnostic

Call Me Comrade 
What society had government based on religion, and a society characterized by incredible (relatively) wealth by the ruling class, and widespread poverty of the masses? What society made religion a central focus of foreign policy and diplomacy? The answer, Europe from the Middle Ages until the Peace of Westphalia (1648). Also acceptable answers, current day middle eastern countries. Has anyone besides myself made this correlation or am I pulling it out of thin air?If you agree with the premise that modern middle eastern governments/societies have siginificant parallels with those of European countries prior to the Peace of Westphalia, then another correlation arises. The correlation, of course, is that Lenin may have been right. He wrote that societies progress in a predictable and similar fashion. Starting from tribal man he wrote that the economic and social progressions each society has experienced mirror eachother. Capitalism was the logical outcome of Imperialism, and he believed that Socialism is the logical outcome of Capitalism. He may not have had the correct conclusion about Capitalism resulting in Socialism, but that remains to be seen (especially the way liberal forces in America and Europe have expanded the welfare state). His conclusion notwithstanding, his theory raises some interesting points. If societies progress along similar and predictable lines, what does it say about our nation building efforts in a region of the world analagous to Medieval Europe? Lenin's theory suggests that the shared experience of each society continuously impacts the way they view government, and thus the governments they develop. It also suggests that links in the development chain cannot be skipped. Could an outside power have forced medieval Europe to democratize prior to 1648? Europeans nations were not even uniformly democratic after the Peace of Westphalia, but the role religion played in foreign policy was clearly different. Were European societies ready to be democratic before they became democratic of their own volition? Are middle eastern societies ready to be democratic? European democratic reform was enacted from within. The only semblance of democracy in middle eastern nations has been enacted by western powers. European nations did not remove religion from a central role in foreign policy until years of warfare, culminating in the 30 years war, brought them to the realization that decimating their societies was a greater evil than allowing infidels and heretics to practice their own religion. Are middle eastern societies ready to accept that infidels should be allowed to practice their religion freely, as infidels?If Lenin had it right, then nation building excercises are a waste of time and resources. Conservatives in America have been voicing the same arguments. What we are attempting to do in the middle east is to remove at least one link from Lenin's chain of societal development, probably more. If we are able to succeed in planting democracy in a region and society whose history does not have the history, and thus the "requisite" links in the chain of development, then Lenin's theory of the development of society will be disproven. If Lenin is right, our middle eastern politics will become a disaster; and Samuel Huntington will soon be proven correct.-MilitantAgnostic

Save us from ourselves 
I used to have reservations about the government saving us from our own behavior. Then I discovered this wonderful article. You may as well throw your support now for what used to be referred to so derogatorily as the "nanny state." We must now embrace the Save-Me-State. We citizens are blissfully unaware of the very problems and dangers our own behaviors and pursuits draw us into every day. I mocked the thought of government regulating our diets; that was before I knew that our current obesity problem is "every bit as threatening as the terrorist threat." All you naysayers should come around and accept the new role of government. If we are allowed to make our own decisions we will never succeed, and will probably die a horrible horrible death. Or is it that if we do succeed we die a horrible horrible death?Don't you see??? True liberty is the freedom to be stopped from possibly detrimental behavior.-MilitantAgnostic

Feminist outcomes 
Cops in Georgia caught Brian Nichols today. He is alleged to have killed four people. Now that he is caught we can ask why this happened? Why was a large man on rape charges allowed to be left alone with a single female guard? Because women can do whatever men can do, of course. Nichols had already been caught trying to bring makeshift weapons into the courtroom, but was somehow not considered a significant security threat. Let's just accept that men are bigger and stronger than women are. Our country will be safer. Nichols should never have been in the custody of a single guard, regardless of sex. The genius who decided to put a single female in charge of the transport of a black man with an alleged history of violence against his own girlfriend should be fired. Let's be honest with our policy and our actions, even if some of us aren't necessarily comfortable acknowledging that there may be differences between the sexes or races.-MilitantAgnostic

Open letter to Gary Aldrich 
Dear Gary Aldrich,You must be the most brilliant comic mind of our time. Either that or the most accomplished person ever... Most accomplished person with DOWN Syndrome ever...That's what I meant. I read your piece about the "liberal" push for the legalization of medical marijuana and I could not stop laughing. It was wonderful of you to provide such comic relief in your piece; especially because it was so pervaded with unsupported cliche comments about the dangers of drug abuse.All the elements of your traditional drug propaganda were there. You had the famous "gateway drug" scenario, complete with no factual evidence. There was also the timeless tactic of lumping illicit drugs together, implying that these drugs are all the same. In fact, you might be surprised to know, the drugs you lump together, specifically cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol, have very different effects... It's a little known fact. Cocaine is a stimulant, alcohol is a depressant, and from what I recall of my high school health class marijuana is in a class all by itself. Seeing as these drugs are three different category of drug, with three different effects it would seem that they should not be referred to in a singular category. This rule applies with respect to their impact on the individual as well as their "impact on society."One paragraph that had me laughing particularly hard was this one:"Yet selfish, self-centered Liberals don’t care about any of that – they just want their marijuana, cocaine, or whatever designer drug is in fashion. What they won’t admit is that many cannot enjoy their sexual activities without using the drugs – this is the dirty little secret that nobody wants to talk about. The effects of marijuana and cocaine are often more powerful than Viagra. The Liberal guy pushes drug use because everyone knows drugs sweep away a woman’s natural reluctance to behave like a barnyard goat."This paragraph is wrought with comedy...And inaccuracy. If marijuana or cocaine were more powerful than Viagra then Viagra never would have been invented. Marijuana and cocaine were both legal within the last 100 years. Don't you think that if they had effects combating "erectile disfunction" it would have been discovered and exploited already? Why would you make an assertion that only Liberals need drugs to enjoy their sex? Isn't Bob Dole a spokesman for Viagra? Is there something inherently more invidious about a naturally occurring drug that causes an erection than a man made one? I absolutely love the respect you show women. God forbid what would happen if we allowed women to remove their social burkhas and make decisions about how they choose to live as men are allowed. What's that sound??? Oh...Quiet honey the men are talking.Another interesting point I found in your article was your excellent manipulation of mathematics. Please teach me this skill. In your article you refer to "80% of us who never used illegal drugs and never will." Yet, the governments own survey on drug use estimates that 46% of Americans have used an illicit drug in their lives. So between the 80% who have never and will never used drugs, and the 46% who have used or are using drugs, that leaves... A little under 107,925,400 more "selfish Liberals" that need to be jailed. The math is simple. The government estimates that 108,250,000 people have used illegal drugs in their lives. There were 246,100 people in state prisons for drugs in 2001. There were 78,501 people in federal prison for drug offenses in 2001. Figure we've caught some of those liberals since 2001, we've been going at a good rate (19,000 state prisoners for drug offenses in 1980). Still that leaves over 100,000,000 selfish liberals roaming the streets out of your estimated 126% of our country. You either have the math skills of an inner city public school student or you are just a liar. You can choose.-MilitantAgnostic

Con men 
It's hard to find the political center of America today. That's because our political spectrum no longer runs along a straight line. Now our political spectrum, at least as is comprised by those who have the capacity to rule and make decisions, runs the shape of a "V." The top points of the "V" represent the social left and right of our country; the apex represents the point where the two sides unite in their ideology. Unfortunately for anyone who wants to be able to decide how they want to live their lives the point of unity lies on the political left. There is no longer any discernible political conservative movement; the social conservatives have taken control of the conservative agenda and employed "liberal" policies to meet their ends. What is popularly referred to as conservative in modern American politics actually refers to Neo-Cons. Cons being the operative term. They have convinced conservative minded people in America that they represent their values. The ones who recognize that they do not actually stand for anything politically conservative are generally forced to support them in elections because they see them as the lesser of two evils.A true conservative would still advocate a federal system with respect for States' rights and a limited federal government. Indeed, George W. Bush advocated a federal approach to gay marriage and the death penalty when he was the Governor of Texas. Now he talks about an amendment to the constitution banning gay marriage. An amendment banning gay marriage could possibly be defended by Neo-cons if judicial decisions attempt to force all states to recognize gay marriages from states like Massachusetts. But what about other government incursions into the land of state and individual rights? Without bringing up contentious topics, such as the War on Drugs, Neo-cons are making strong statements that this is not your grandfathers conservative party. National Review columnist David Frum wrote the following comments in his online diary:"I know it will make our friends at the Cato Institute choke, but with a new study suggesting that more than one-fourth of the rise in health costs can be attributed to obesity, would somebody explain slowly to me why a federal tax of say a penny an ounce on calorific sodas would not be a good idea?"Are you serious? A man with the word "conservative" in any part of his political description advocating government regulation on what we eat? Our sustenance? I thought conservatives were supposed to advocate more personal freedom, not less. The War on Substance Abuse is possibly somehow defensible from a moral perspective, but the War on Sustenance Abuse? Are Big Macs immoral? Or just a bad idea? Is wearing weighted boots and jumping off the side of a cruise ship deck immoral? Or just a bad idea? The idea of personal freedom necessarily entails the freedom to make bad decisions. How can a government that purports to be the government of the "freest" country on earth justify regulating dietary decisions? For this regulation to be advocated by the "conservative" party is mind boggling. I would like to think that the statements made by Mr. Frum are the views of one rogue journalist, or perhaps a rogue publication, but their advertising asserts that the National Review is the leading "conservative" publication and the most influential news source in the White House.Today we choose between a social left and a social right, both operating on the political left. This operation from the stance that federal regulation and coercion is a good thing will only exacerbate the growing cultural war. As the government gleans more power the social left and right will see that they have more and more to win... or lose; and they will fight harder. After all, what is at stake is the right of people to live their lives the way they want, something very dear to people. This means the bases of each party will gain more and more power within the party and will stretch our "V." Eventually maybe the bases will fight hard enough to pull our political spectrum back into a straight line; but then where would that lead us?-MilitantAgnostic

Mission Statement 
Welcome to MilitantlyAgnostic.com where I will analyze news in politics and the media in general. My goal is to expose hypocrisy in the left and the right to hopefully engage in debates beyond the "he said, she said" construct of current political discussion. I will search for the compromise in ideas held by the left and right to search for and explore solutions that both will find suitable. To do this I will employ a relentless use of reason and a heavy dose of sarcasm. I hope you enjoy and I look foward to your agreement, or disagreement.-MilitantAgnostic
