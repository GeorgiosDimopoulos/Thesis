Another one for Simon!

Cutthroat Bridge to Low Bradfield
Yesterday Liz and I had a bracing walk along Derwent Edge in a howling gale. As my dad would say, it certainly blew away the cobwebs! 
We caught a bus out to Cutthroat Bridge on the A57. From there it's a long, steady climb up to Derwent Edge. Once you reach the top you're rewarded with dramatic views across the Derwent Valley and the hills beyond. Yesterday it was a little too breezy to stand around admiring the scenery, but here's a picture I took a few years ago in more temperate conditions.
Scattered along Derwent Edge are a number unusual rock formations, with curious names like the Salt Cellar, the Cakes of Bread and the Dove Stone. They are gritstone tors, similar to the granite tors of Dartmoor. Some of them have Victorian graffiti carved into their surfaces.
We followed the path along Derwent Edge for a couple of miles, then turned off just before Back Tor. As we dropped down on to the track known as Foulstone Road, the wind dropped and the skies cleared. It felt like spring again! We spotted about a dozen mountain hares, their coats midway between winter white and summer brown. Sadly, they were too far away to get a decent photo.
We made our way down through the woods and along the road to Brogging End, near Strines Reservoir. This is the home of the roughest, toughest chickens in the whole of the Pennines. They range freely through the forestry plantation, looking not unlike their junglefowl ancestors.
As we passed by yesterday, most of the hens were enjoying an afternoon dust-bath whilst the cockerel stood guard, preening himself in a shaft of sunlight.
Lower down the valley, towards Dale Dike, the fields were full of sheep with new-born lambs. We stopped to watch as the youngsters gambolled about on wobbly legs.
As we walked along the lane to Low Bradfield to catch the bus home, we spotted the first swallow of the year. Summer won't be long now!

Sex & Violets
This afternoon I took my camera for a stroll along the Rivelin Valley. I thought this picture might make up for those disgusting close-ups of rodent droppings! 
This is such an exciting time of year to walk in the woods. The spring flowers are appearing one by one as the weather gets warmer: celandines, wood anemones, golden saxifrage, wood sorrel and, today, dog violet. At the same time, the woods are filling with birdsong as the summer migrants begin to trickle in: chiffchaffs, willow warblers and blackcaps.
Of course, it's all about sex: the mad drive to reproduce!

Crap Thursday
I spent much of Thursday morning on my hands and knees photographing rodent droppings on the banks of a pond in the Shire Brook Valley Nature Reserve.
No, this isn't some bizarre obsession! I was helping my colleague, Cheryl, prepare materials for a training course on water voles.
If you're interested, the droppings on the left originated from the rear end of a brown rat. The ones on the right came from a water vole.
What a funny way to make a living!

Greater love hath no man...
There was a brief but remarkable story on The Today Programme this morning about a group of American military veterans who are demonstrating their opposition to the war in Iraq by donating bone marrow and organs to save the lives of Iraqi children. Their spokesman, Bruce Gorcyca, said:
"I want the world to know that not every American is an arrogant bully who gets his way at the end of a gun barrel. There are quite a few Americans that are very upset over the situation in Iraq and they have no way to help. This is one of the very few ways in which they can, without having to spend a lot of money. I myself am donating a kidney, a section of my liver and bone marrow to three Iraqi children."
This set me thinking about the Terri Schiavo case. We've seen a lot of so-called 'Pro-Life' protesters on TV recently, brandishing placards and chanting slogans. I wonder how many of them care deeply enough about the sanctity of human life to join Bruce Gorcyca and his fellow veterans.

Animal Crackers
With the exception of Good Friday, the Easter weekend has been grey, cold and damp in our neck-of-the-woods. We've not exactly had the sort of weather that inspires me to get out and about with my camera, so I present a small selection of my favourite animal snaps from Flickr instead (an idea that I nicked from Flickrzen).

Kinsey
Tonight we went to see Kinsey at The Showroom. What a brilliant film! I enjoyed it a great deal more than I thought I would. It features fine performances from Liam Neeson and Laura Linney. John Lithgow was excellent as Alfred Kinsey's tyrannical and repressed father (a far cry from Dick Solomon).
Although it's a 'serious' biopic, Kinsey contains a lot of humour. At times I thought it was going to turn into Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (But Were Afraid To Ask). There were some laugh-out-loud jokes at the expense of one of Kinsey's straight-laced academic colleagues (played by Tim Curry, who I couldn't help thinking of in his Transylvanian Transvestite garb).

Hey Prude
On Good Friday, Liz an I caught a bus to Castleton in the Peak District National Park. We walked up Cave Dale and along the track to Windy Knoll, then climbed Mam Tor and headed across the ridge towards Lose Hill. This is a favourite walk of ours, mainly because of the fantastic views you get along the way. The route does tend to get a little busy in places (especially around Mam Tor) but we know a few 'detours' to get away from the crowds.
Whilst eating lunch near the top of Cave Dale, I heard a brief snatch of birdsong. Flitting about a nearby outcrop was a wheatear, a particularly welcome sight as it is one of the first of the summer migrants to arrive in our part of the UK.
A few hours later, pausing for breath on the ridge between Mam Tor and Lose Hill, we had a fine view of the entrance to Peak Cavern on the opposite side the Hope Valley. It struck me that Peak Cavern has something in common the wheatear: they were both the victims of Victorian prudery.
The name 'wheatear' was invented by Victorian naturalists who thought that the original name of the bird, 'white-arse', might cause offence. However, the name 'white-arse' makes considerably more sense because the bird's most obvious distinguishing feature is its prominent white rump. There are now quite a few birdwatchers who insist in using the wheatear's true name. Good for them!
Peak Cavern was apparently once known as The Devil's Arse by the villagers of Castleton. It is said to have been renamed by its owners to avoid causing offence to Victorian tourists. A few years ago, the old name was revived as a clever marketing ploy.
Another fine example of a bowdlerised landscape feature is Bod an Deamhain in the Cairngorm Mountains. Victorian cartographers dubbed it 'The Devil's Point', even though the literal translation of the mountain's Gaelic name is 'The Prick of the Demon'.
I suppose the 21st Century equivalent of Victorian prudery is political correctness. As a naturalist, I admit to feeling rather uncomfortable when people ask me to identify the fungus known as 'Jew's Ear'... even though a Jewish friend wasn't in the least bit offended when I explained the origin of the name. As he observed, words have to be seen in the social context in which they were coined.

Domestic
There was a disturbance on the bus I caught home from work this evening. A drunken couple were knocking each other about. From what I could hear, the woman seemed to be landing more blows than the man. Despite this, he kept on goading her:
"Come on then, punch the f**k out of me. See if I care, you fat f***ing ugly Scottish c**t!"
They clearly had one of those unfathomable abusive relationships, steeped in misery, where the partners just keep coming back for more instead of doing the 'sensible' thing and going their separate ways.
Eventually the couple got off outside the Children's Hospital and continued their punch-up in the street. As the bus pulled away, I caught the man's eye. He looked as mad as a box of frogs, a terrifying mixture of Frank Gallagher, Jack Torrance and Robert Kilroy-Silk.

It's all about knives and forks
A couple of weeks back I bought David Byrne's most recent album, Grown Backwards. Forgive the pun, but it has certainly grown on me.
The album has some great lyrics:
CIVILIZATION
Somewhere between the darkness and lightFaces all glow but its not too brightCivilization, it's all about knives and forks 
Isn't she here? What time is it now?Is this the right place? Do I fit with her crowd?I'm gonna be a civilized man someday 
Part of me wants to jump and shoutPart of me wants to tear it downI thought you might prefer the Cabernet 
Civilization, it's all about sexHavin' a ball in a padded banquetI'm gonna be that really cool guy someday 
The waiter looks me overWould you like cream or sugar? I don't know - what was I supposed to say 
She wonders if I'll noticeI should have brought some rosesHer plate is full, she hasn't eaten all day 
Glasses collect we order some boozeShe looks at me, I stare at her shoesMature situations, maybe a broken heart 
Maybe I ought to pay the billMaybe she thinks I never willA million things that cross a woman's mind 
Just be yourself, well that's what they sayI barely know who I was yesterdayI'm gonna be that civilized guy someday 
Good friends and conversationsThe rise and fall of nationsA moments glory and they've had their day 
And on my high school folderI drew a big gorillaSomething familiar, something far, far away 
Somewhere between the darkness and lightShe touches my hand, she don't seem to mind 
We can go home, we can be civilized
Many, many years ago I went to a Talking Heads gig at Sheffield Students Union. I paid the exorbitant sum of £1.25 to see them and their support (Dire Straits). I remember being distinctly underwhelmed by both bands. 
What did I know?
