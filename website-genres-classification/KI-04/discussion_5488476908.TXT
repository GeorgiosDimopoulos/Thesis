Various people on the Linux kernel mailing list and elsewhere have been heard 
to opine that CML2's user interface is too oriented towards nontechnical 
users. In response to these complaints, I have implemented a fourth CML2 
front end with an interface style expressly designed for the serious, 
hard-core hacker. A transcript of an example session follows: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Welcome to CML2 Adventure, version 1.6.1. 
You are in a maze of twisty little Linux kernel options menus, all different. 
The main room. A sign reads `Linux Kernel Configuration System'. 
Passages lead off in all directions. 

> n 
The arch room. A sign reads `Processor type'. 
A passage leads upwards. 

Choose your processor architecture. 
A brass lantern is here. 
There is a row of buttons on the wall of this room. They read: 
X86, ALPHA, SPARC32, SPARC64, MIPS32, MIPS64, PPC, M68K, ARM, SUPERH, IA64, PARISC, S390, S390X, CRIS 
The button marked X86 is pressed. 
> take lantern 
Lantern: taken. 
> look X86 
Value of X86 is y. 
This is Linux's home port. Linux was originally native to the Intel 
386, and runs on all the later x86 processors including the Intel 
486, 586, Pentiums, and various instruction-set-compatible chips by 
AMD, Cyrix, and others. 
> up 
In main room. 
> nearby 
The arch room. A sign reads `Processor type'. 
The archihacks room. A sign reads `Architecture-specific hardware hacks'. 
The buses room. A sign reads `System buses and controller types'. 
The pm room. A sign reads `Power management'. 
The mtd room. A sign reads `Memory Technology Device (MTD) support'. 
The x86 room. A sign reads `Intel and compatible 80x86 processor options'. 
The policy room. A sign reads `Configuration policy options'. 
The generic room. A sign reads `Architecture-independent feature selections'. 
The block_devices room. A sign reads `Block devices'. 

> go generic 
The generic room. A sign reads `Architecture-independent feature selections'. 
A passage leads upwards. 

There is an option named MODULES here. 
There is an option named NET here. 
There is an option named SYSVIPC here. 
There is an option named BSD_PROCESS_ACCT here. 
There is an option named SYSCTL here. 
There is an option named BINFMT_AOUT here. 
There is an option named BINFMT_MISC here. 
There is an option named SMP here. 
> take NET 
NET: taken. 
> take MODULES 
Tristate symbols won't default to M. 
MODULES: taken. 
> up 
In main room. 
> nearby 
The arch room. A sign reads `Processor type'. 
The archihacks room. A sign reads `Architecture-specific hardware hacks'. 
The buses room. A sign reads `System buses and controller types'. 
The pm room. A sign reads `Power management'. 
The mtd room. A sign reads `Memory Technology Device (MTD) support'. 
The x86 room. A sign reads `Intel and compatible 80x86 processor options'. 
The policy room. A sign reads `Configuration policy options'. 
The generic room. A sign reads `Architecture-independent feature selections'. 
The block_devices room. A sign reads `Block devices'. 

> go buses 
The buses room. A sign reads `System buses and controller types'. 
A passage leads upwards. 

Specify the buses, disk controllers, and internal interconnection standards 
that you want your kernel to support. 
It is very dark. If you continue, you are likely to be eaten by a grue. 
There is an option named EISA here. 
There is an option named PCI here. 
There is an option named PNP here. 
There is an option named PARPORT here. 
There is an option named HOTPLUG here. 
There is an option named IDE here. 
There is an option named SCSI here. 
There is an option named USB here. 
There is an option named I2O here. 
There is an option named MTD here. 
There is an option named WATCHDOG here. 
> light lantern 
The lantern radiates a mellow golden light. 
> take PCI 
PCI: taken. 
> help 
Welcome to the adventure configurator. For a command summary, type `commands'. 
In general, a three-letter abbreviation of any command word is sufficient 
to identify it to the parser. 

This interface emulates the style of classic text adventure games such as 
Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork. Configuration menus are rooms, and 
configuration options are objects that can be taken and dropped (except 
for choice/radiobutton symbols, which become buttons on various room walls). 
Objects and rooms may silently appear and disappear as visibilities 
change. 

Have fun, and beware of the grues! 

In main room. 
> commands 
look [target] -- look here or at target (direction or option). 
nearby -- list nearby rooms (useful with go) 
go -- go to a named menu (follow with the label). 
inventory -- show which options you have picked up. 
drop -- unset option. 
take [module] -- set option, follow with option name. 
press -- press a button (follow with the button name). 
set -- set numeric or string; follow with symbol and value. 
load -- read in a configuration (follow with the filename). 
save -- save the configuration (follow with a filename). 
xyzzy -- toggle suppression flag. 
quit -- quit, discarding changes. 
exit -- exit, saving the configuration. 
You can move in compass directions n,e,w,s,ne,nw,se,sw or dn for down. 
> quit
