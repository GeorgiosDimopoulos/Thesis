Special Offer  
A nerd was walking on campus one day when his friend, another nerd, rode up on an incredible shiny new bicycle.
The first nerd was stunned and asked, "Where did you get such a nice bike?"he second nerd replied, "Well, yesterday I was walking home minding my own business when a beautiful woman rode up to me on this bike. She threw the bike to the ground, took off all her clothes and said, "Take what you want!"The second nerd nodded approvingly, "Good choice. The clothes probably wouldn't have fit."

Corporate Exercise  
Ever wondered why we are always so tired by the end of the day? Maybe companies don't require physical fitness programmes......
* Everyone gets enough exercise:
* jumping to conclusions
* beating around the bush
* running down the boss
* going around in circles
* dragging their feet
* passing the buck
* climbing the ladder
* wading through paperwork
* pulling strings

A Racist Joke  
No pun intended to our fellow LSBians...There is a beautiful deserted island in the middle of nowhere where the following group of people is stranded:
* 2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman 
* 2 French men and 1 French woman 
* 2 German men and 1 German woman 
* 2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman 
* 2 Bulgarian men and 1 Bulgarian woman 
* 2 Irish men and 1 Irish woman 
* 2 American men and 1 American woman 
* 2 Indian men and 1 Indian woman 
One month later on this absolutely stunning deserted island in the middle of nowhere, the following has occurred:One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.The two French men and the French woman are living happily together in a "menage a trois".The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they alternate with the German woman.The two Greek men are sleeping with each other and the Greek woman is cleaning and cooking for them.The Bulgarian men took a long look at the endless ocean and one look at the Bulgarian woman and they started swimming.The Irish began by dividing up their island, Northside and Southside, and by setting up a distillery. They do not remember if sex is in the picture because it gets sort of foggy after the first few liters of coconut whiskey, but at least the English are not getting any.
The two American men are contemplating the virtues of suicide while the American woman keeps on talking about her body being her own, the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that they can do, about the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of household chores, how her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her much nicer and how her relationship with her mother is improving. But at least the taxes are low and it is not raining.
...AND...
The 2 Indian men are still waiting for someone to introduce them to the Indian woman.

The Feather Story  
An English anthropologist was walking down the road of an American Indian reservation camp. Along the way he met an Indian with a feather on his head. He asked the Indian,'Hey, Indian! What does that feather mean?'The Indian answered,'This feather means I f..... one squaw.' (an Indian female)'Oooh.', remarked the Englishman.He went his way again until he met another Indian with five feathers on his head. He queried,'Hey, Indian! What do those five feathers mean?''These five feathers mean,' proudly said the Indian, 'I f..... five squaws.''Oh, I see.', remarked the Englishman.Again, the Englishman walked his way again until he met another Indian with ten feathers on his head and he still asked the same question. The Indian replied, 'These feathers mean I f..... TEN squaws!''Ooohh, interesting.' nodded the Englishman.And the Indian added,'You should see village chief.'And off the Englishman went to see the chief. He approached the chief wearing his crown of feathers and asked,'Hey, Village Chief! What do all those feathers mean?'With a flourish, the chief said proudly,'These feathers mean I f..... WHOLE VILLAGE!''Whole Village?! Holy cow!', gasped the Englishman.'Yes, cows too.', added the chief.'But aren't they hostile??', asked our Englishman.'Horsestyle, dogstyle, any style.', dismissed the chief.'Oh, dear.', shook the Englishman.'No. No dear. Ass too high.',reminded the chief.

The Hair Cut / The Sparrow  
The HaircutA young boy had just gotten his driving permit. He asked his father, who was a minister, if they could discuss the use of the car. His father took him to his study and said to him, "I'll make a deal with you. You bring your grades up, study your bible a little and get your hair cut and we'll talk about it."After about a month the boy came back and again asked his father if they could discuss use of the car. They again went to the father's study where his father said, "Son, I've been real proud of you. You have brought your grades up, you've studied your bible diligently, but you didn't get your hair cut!"The young man waited a moment and replied, "You know Dad, I've been thinking about that. You know, Samson had long hair, Moses had long hair, Noah had long hair, and even Jesus had long hair...."To which his father replied... "Yes, and they WALKED every where they went!"
The SparrowOnce upon a time there was a non-conforming sparrow who decided not to fly south for the winter. However, soon the weather turned so cold that he reluctantly decided to fly south.In a short time ice began to form on his wings and he fell to Earth in a barnyard, nearly frozen solid. A cow passed by where he had fallen, and crapped on the little sparrow.The sparrow thought it was the end, but the manure warmed him and defrosted his wings! Warm and happy, able to breath, he started to sing.Just then a large cat came by, and hearing the chirping he investigated the sounds. The cat cleared away the manure, found the chirping bird, and promptly ate him.The Moral of the Story:Everyone who craps on you is not necessarily your enemyEveryone who gets you out of crap is not necessarily your friend. And if you're warm and happy in a pile of crap, you might just want to keep your mouth shut.

Tarzan & Cawat  
Suatu hari kat dalam hutan...Monyet : Tarzan..., kenapa engkau sorang je yang pakai cawat? Kami semua tak pakai. Ada apa-apa rahsia ke?Tarzan : Tak ada apalah!Monyet : Kita kan kawan baik. Takkan nak berahsia kut?Tarzan : Aku kata tak ada..., tak ada lah!Monyet sungguh rasa tak puas hati dengan jawapan Tarzan. So dia pun ajak kawan-kawan dia ke pondok Tarzan dan mengintai untuk congkel rahsia Tarzan. Seperti biasa, sebelum mandi Tarzan mesti buka cawat dia (itulah satu-satunya cawat yang dia ada). Bila tengok aja keadaan Tarzan yang berbogel tu, monyet-monyet tu pun ketawa dengan berdekah-dekah.Monyet : Patutlah dia pakai cawat. Rupa-rupanya dia malu sebab ekor dia kat depan...

A Bull Story  
A man takes his wife to the stock show. They start heading down the alley that houses all the bulls. The sign on the first bull's stall states: "This bull mated 50 times last year." The wife turns to her husband and says, "He mated 50 times in a year, isn't that nice!."They proceed to the next bull and his sign stated: "This bull mated 65 times last year." The wife turns to her husband and says, "This one mated 65 times last year. That is over 5 times a month. You could learn from this one!"They proceeded to the last bull and his sign said: "This bull mated 365 times last year." The wife's mouth drops open and says, "WOW! He mated 365 times last year. That is ONCE A DAY!!! You could really learn from this one."The fed up man turns to his wife and says, "Go up and inquire if it was 365 times with the same cow!"

Chinese Monkey Story (and has good moral behind it)  
If you think you have read this before... read FURTHER ........There was once a hat-seller who passed by a forest on his way back. The weather was very hot and so he decided to take a nap under one of the trees, and left his whole basket of hats by the side. A few hours later, he was awakened by some sound. The next thing he realised was that all his hats were gone. Then he heard some monkey sound on top of the trees and so he looked up. To his surprise, the trees were full of monkeys and they had taken all his hats. The hat-seller sat down and thought of how he could get back the hats. He thought and thought and started scratching his head. The next moment, he realised that the monkeys were doing the same action. Next, he took down his own hat and fanned himself and the monkeys did exactly the same. An idea came upon him, he took his hat and threw it onto the ground .... and the monkeys did that too. So he finally managed to get back all his hats.Fifty years later ............, his grandson also became a hat-seller and had heard this monkey thing from his grandfather. One day, just like his grandfather, he passed by the same forest, was very hot, took a nap under the same tree and had left the hats beside him. Again, when he woke up, he realised that all his hats were gone. He looked up and realised that the monkeys had taken all his hats. Remembering what his grandfather had told him, he started scratching his head and the monkeys followed. He took down his hat and fanned himself and again the monkeys followed. Now, very convinced of his grandfather's idea, he threw his hat onto the ground ....... but to his surprise, the monkeys still held on to all the hats.Then one monkey climbed down the tree, grabbed the hat on the ground, gave him a slap and said : "Hey, you think only you have grandfather-ah........!!!
