Out With A Bowling Pin Before.



Hey know, that's discriminatory! I ain't no bowling pin - I'm a motherfucking juggling club, not some namby-pamby pin that exists purely to be knocked down by some asshole spheroid!



I Apologize For Insulting You But Could You Please Tone Down Your Profanities?  Your Language Is Clashing With The Sumptuous Surroundings.



Okay okay, I'm sorry for yelling, but it just really gets on my nerves when people make baseless derogatory assumptions like that.



Again I Did Not Mean To Insult You.



I know babe, I know, and I'm sorry for my outburst.  It's just something I have to deal with on a regular basis, you know?  And I mean, I look nothing at all like a bowling pin! Those assh- er, those jerks are squat and round while I'm pleasingly lanky.



I Must Admit You Are Well-



Erm



Proportioned.



And so are you, babe.  Love the dress, by the way, very classy, yet it doesn't hide your stunning figure.



Oh Um Thank You. I Actually Designed It Myself.



No shit!  Really?



Yes Shit.  Hee Hee.



Ha ha ha ha! That was a good one!  Man, you're beautiful, talented, and got a sense of humour to boot! What are you doing here with a grungy club like me?



Oh Don't Say That I Think You Are Actually Very Handsome.  Your Blue Tie Sets Off Against Your White...



Um...



Skin?



Very Nicely.



Sure babe, you can call it skin if that works for you.  So, going back to my original question, what do you like to do for fun? Design clothes?



Yes I Enjoy Aesthetic Design Very Much And Am Actually Finishing Up Design School Currently.  I Also Like To Read.  But Generally I Just Like Making Things - Clothes Especially - But I Enjoy All Sorts Of Physical Creation And Manifestation.  I've Even Been Known To Partake In Woodworking.



Man, and all I'm good at is being flipped around in the air!



Hee Hee Well You Do Look Very Aerodynamic.



Well, maybe if you play your cards right, later I can show you just how aerodynamic I can be. ;)



...



Well That's A Very Tempting Offer To Be Sure But Oh Look Our Food Is Here.



ALRIGHT, CHOW DOWN FUCKMUNCHES.



FUCKMUNCHERS.







FOODMUNCHERS.







FOODFUCKMUNCHIES.







FUCKERFOODMUNCHES.







OH FUCK YOU AND YOU BETTER FUCKING TIP WELL.







ENJOY YOUR MEAL, GLOBESTIFFLERS.







Damn, our waiter is very...



Colorful?



Yeah... that's a good word for it.  ...Well, shall we dig in?



Lets.

Sorry I haven't been a great conversationalist, but this food is just so damn tasty!



I Concur.  My Linguini With Couscous Is Quite Delicious.  How Is Your Meal?



Oh man, these cajun-shrimp chimichangas topped with curried goulash are delicious.



I Don't Know If I Will Be Able To Have A Dessert After This.



I hear ya.  That mango-baklava-torte sounds very tempting, but...



The Meals Are As Filling As They Are Delicious.



Exactly. So, when are you planning on graduating? Are you gonna try an work in the fashion industry afterwards?



No No We've Talked Far Too Much About Me. I'd Like To Know About You.



Okay, shoot.  Whatchoo wanna know about me?



We Have Thoroughly Canvassed The Subject Of What My Pleasure Activities Are But I Would Like To Know Yours.



Well, I'm not sure I can properly discuss my pleasure activities in such polite company... ;)



You Know What I Meant. What Do You Like To Do For Fun?



Well, I live a very active life, obviously, so most of my leisure time is spent being, well, leisurely - you know, hanging out, watching TV, resting, and lots of sleep.  My day job tires me out like you wouldn't believe.



I Would Imagine So.



Plus my klutz of an owner drops me fairly often, so I need plenty of rest to recuperate.



Does Being Dropped Actually Physically Hurt You?



Well, usually not, but it hurts emotionally, you know?  It's like he doesn't really care.



There There I Am Sure It Is Not Intentional He Is Just A Little Prone To Accident.



Yeah, I guess.  So anyway, that's mostly what I do for fun, but if I'm well-rested and I have a little extra time off, then I like to go... clubbing.

That Was An Extremely Pleasant Evening. Thank You.



It was truly my pleasure, Kanaya.  I hope you had fun?



I Did.



So, um, is there a chance that maybe we could, you know, do this again some time?



I Believe There Is A Very Good Chance That Such An Occurence Could Transpire Again.



Oh man, that's really great to hear.  I had a wonderful evening with you.



And I You.
