Your allowable capital loss deduction for any tax year, figured on Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), is limited to the lesser of:

As a result of a bankruptcy, the bank foreclosed on my house. Can you tell me where and how to report this loss on my taxes?
The foreclosure or repossession is treated as a sale or exchange from which you, the borrower, may realize gain or loss. However, if you realize a loss on personal use property, such as your residence, the loss is not deductible. Refer to Publication 544, Sales and other Dispositions of Assets, and Publication 908 (PDF), Bankruptcy Tax Guide, for more information.

I own stock which became worthless last year. Can I take a bad debt deduction on my tax return?
If you own securities and they become totally worthless, you can take a deduction for a loss, but not for a bad debt. 
The worthless securities are treated as though they were capital assets sold on the last day of the tax year if they were capital assets in your hands. Report worthless securities on line 1 or line 8 of Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), whichever applies. In columns (c) and (d), write "Worthless." For additional information, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses (Including Capital Gains and Losses). For more information on bad debts, refer to Tax Topic 453, Bad Debt Deduction.
