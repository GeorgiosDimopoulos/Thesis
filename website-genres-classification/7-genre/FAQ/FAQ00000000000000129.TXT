4.1 Interest/Dividends/Other Types of Income: 1099&#8211;DIV Dividend Income
How do I report this 1099-DIV from my mutual fund?
Enter the ordinary dividends from Form 1099-DIV (PDF), box 1, on line 9 of Form 1040 (PDF), U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Enter the total capital gain distributions from box 2a on line 13, column (f) of Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF). Enter the 28% rate gain portion of your capital gain distributions from box 2b on line 13, column (g) of Schedule D. If you have an amount in box 2c or box 2d, refer to Instructions for Form 1040, Schedule D. Nontaxable distributions, box 3, that are return of capital distributions, reduce your cost basis and are not taxable until your basis is reduced to zero. If no amount is shown in boxes 2b through 2d, and your only capital gains and losses are capital gain distributions, refer to Instructions for Form 1040 for line 13.

Do I have to pay tax on reinvested dividends?
Dividend reinvestment plans let you choose to use your dividends to buy (through an agent) more shares of stock in the corporation instead of receiving the dividends in cash. If you are a member of this type of plan and use your dividends to buy more stock at a price equal to its fair market value, you must report the dividends as income. 
If you are a member of a dividend reinvestment plan that lets you buy more stock at a price less than its fair market value, you must report as income the fair market value of the additional stock on the dividend payment date. 
Other rules may apply. For additional information, refer to Chapter 9 of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, and Tax Topic 404, Dividends.

I received dividends from my credit union. How do I report this income?
Certain distributions commonly referred to as dividends are actually interest. They include "dividends" on deposits or share accounts in cooperative banks, credit unions, domestic savings and loan associations, and mutual savings banks. 
Report interest income on line 8a of Form 1040 (PDF) or Form 1040A (PDF), or line 2 of Form 1040EZ (PDF). If your taxable interest income is more than $1,500, be sure to show that income on Schedule B of Form 1040, or on Schedule 1 of Form 1040A. You cannot file Form 1040EZ if your interest income is more than $1,500. Refer to Tax Topic 403, Interest Received, for additional information on interest income.
