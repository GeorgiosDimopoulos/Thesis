The American Philosophical Association is the main professional organization for philosophers in the United States.  Founded in 1900, its mission is to promote the exchange of ideas among philosophers, to encourage creative and scholarly activity in philosophy, to facilitate the professional work and teaching of philosophers, and to represent philosophy as a discipline. 

For a brief description of the structure and functions of the Association, see our Guide to the American Philosophical Association.
