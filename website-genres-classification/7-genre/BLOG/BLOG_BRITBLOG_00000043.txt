Quick and Dirty Sweep by Jonnyfilmboy 
For those of you new to or unfamiliar with studio photography, a "sweep" is any kind of paper that is draped in a quarter circle. Usually you have these two things called autopoles that are like large shower curtain rods with hooks on the middle of them (adjustble for height). They are placed vertically between the ceiling and the floor and another rod is placed horizontally in between these two autopoles, on the hooks. Then you can tape or clamp a large sheet of paper on that horizontal rod, and "sweep" the paper down and toward the camera until it drapes along the floor. Why do this? Because it is a way of getting a consistent background with no corners. Because of the gradual sweep of the paper, you can have shades of light changing with elevation in a gradual pattern that is very pleasing to the eye. Sweeps when you get down to it can be made very huge and expensively (if you are shooting pics of the new Maybach), or can be made quick and dirty and small for table top shooting (like I did with my flora shots). 
So how did I do this? I have attached pics to this thread that should help you visualize my setup. In a nutshell, I am using a 3' x 3' sheet of paper (in this case, matte board), that I have curved into a 1/4 circle and supported so that it won't pop out straight, as thick board has a tendency to do. I was looking for anything around the house to do this and happened to find a small drafting table (lap top kind of small), which I used to hold down the top of the matte board. This worked very well, but I ended up using a small sandbag to help keep everything in place. Again, see the attached pics for more info. 
I placed the whole thing onto my large drafting table, but any table will do. The reason I used a drafting table was because it has a small adjustable lip on the end of it to keep pencils from rolling off onto the floor. So one end of the matte board is propped up against this lip. Don't have a lip? Use a pair of pony clamps. These rubberized clamps can be obtained at any hardware store and are very inexpensive. For lighting, if you want to do long exposures or don't have a flash or have slower lenses, you are going to need "hot lights", which are just regular color-balanced lights (tungsten or daylight balanced). If you can't afford ARRI, then be resourceful. Use a reliable desk lamp, one that can handle some extra wattage, and buy some nice bulbs. The attached pics shows some of the bulbs I have in my overhead fixtures. I got them at Handy Andy or Menards (US hardware stores) for about $8USD to $12USD. The beautiful thing about these bulbs is that they have a small fresnel lens on the front of them. Not adjustable or anything, but they come in different softnesses, different angles of light projection (from 20 degrees to 180 degrees approx.), and are clearly labeled on the box as to the kind of light quality you will get. They are very clear, easy to use, and built like a $12 lightbulb should be. Very very rugged. In the past, I have placed these bulbs in various fixtures and have gotten very different lighting effects with them. $12 might seem like a lot of money to spend on a bulb, especially since you will need more than one to get different lighting effects, but they are a lot cheaper than buying a nice ARRI or Mole light with a fresnel on the front. Plus if the bulb burns out, replace it for $8 - $12 instead of $20-$200. You are way ahead of the game. Again, these lights are best for table top shooting. I wouldn't show up to do a room scene with a table top lamp. Not gonna work as well. And not too impressive to a client. But I did use these lights to shoot armiture animations when I was in college. People were very impressed with the quality of the images, and asked me what kind of pro lights I had rented to do the shooting. he he he. 
So I hope this helps you guys out. Some of us out there are just scraping along and can't afford the newest Nikkor $1500 lenses. And we have to make do with our imagination and resourcefulness. I come from a background of shooting independent films and low budget/no budget videos where this kind of resourcefulness is not only necessary, but welcomed. The world of photography doesn't seem as open to these sorts of "cheap alternative ideas" but I think it should be. It seems like the moment that "pro" or even "photographic" is applied to an accessory or an instrument, the price goes way up. I saw a level that attaches to your hot shoe. All it does is tell you if your camera is level. Cost like $24!! Should have been $0.24. So stay resourceful! And best of luck to you guys out there. Thanks for the interest in my shooting techniques. If I can think of anything else, I'll post it. Now, if you would like to buy my Professional Photographers Home Sweep Kit, please send $400 to...Just kidding. Pic of the lights on... Notice how little the light is projected out to the sides. It is mostly projected out in front.Pic of my table top setup from the front, with a bent piece of matte board (double sided white and black) as a bounce card. You might also be able to see my cheap and dirty diffusion panel that works awesomely. Check out my home page, gallery section, products section for the Starbucks cups shot I did with this diffusion.The sweep from the side. One thing to note here people. Those of you who are dedicated to using only Auto white balance need to really rethink their ideas behind the importance of WB. Because paper can come in different shades of white, you need to calibrate the white balance for different surfaces (pre on Nikon DSLR's). Of course, the image should be determined by the subject. If you want a cold, crack-smoking, cop who just got suspended, end of act 2 kind of look, then go for the blue end of the spectrum. If you want a warm and christmassy feel, keep the wb warm. It is all subjective. You can white balance on colored cards to get different effects.Some results with this sweep...

Controlling the exposure of a centre-weighted meter  
The vast majority of compact digital camera use a centre-weighted metering system. That means that a greater importance is given to a central area of the frame than to the surrounding part. This is not always the best, since the subject may not fall in that precise location. In such circumstances, the manual usually instructs the user to first focus the camera on the subject, then re-frame. Most cameras use a two-stage shutter release, where the first half-squeeze sets the autofocus and the auto-exposure, and then takes the photo when the shutter release is pressed in all the way. The result of this system is that whatever is placed at the centre of the frame, and focused on, is also at the centre of the light metering pattern. And, therefore has great impact on the overall exposure. In some situations, the results can be less than perfect, with the subject well-exposed and focused, but with the rest of the frame either over or under exposed. The result can be even less satisfactory if the image has been recomposed after the autofocus (AF) and the auto exposure (AE) has been done. To illustrate the point, we can look to the photos below. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
AF/AE is done in the centre of the frame.	 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
AF/AE is done on the branch in the upper left side and the image is then recomposed.	
The images above were taken seconds apart. For the one on the left, the photographer decided the composition desired and took the photo. Since the metering, along with the autofocus was done in the centre of the frame, the image is sharp and the foreground correctly exposed. However, an interesting element of the photo, the green roof of the building in the background, is quite overexposed. The reason is simple: the camera's meter evaluated the scene based on a darker, more light absorbing subject: the tree in the foreground. Since the metering gave more importance to the light coming from that part of the frame, the background became a bit overexposed, and the green colour of the roof almost disappeared. To take the photo on the right, the auto-exposure/autofocus was done by pointing the camera at the branch and sky in the upper left-side. Then, with the shutter release held halfway, the image was recomposed to be similar to the one on the left. Since the area evaluated by the camera contained a better combination of "tree" and "sky", the result is an image that has a better overall exposure. The result can be seen with the building's roof, which is now green, and contributes to the interest of the image. posted by cheewooi at 6:49 AM 0 comments   
Photography Malaysia - Welcome!  
Welcome to Photography Malaysia! Initially I have no idea why I created this blog? For fun? pleasure? or interest in photography? I am a newbie in photography. Stated off 2 years ago with my first digital camera - Canon Powershot A70 - a 3.2 megapixel digital camera. Since then I was interested in taking snap shot, night shot and action photography! My interest getting deeper when I took lots of photo and I evaluate each photo taken. The composition, exposure, focusing - every aspect take into account. After that, I tried digital post processing using Photoshop. Another must have skill for a digital photographer! Now I sees the idea of creating this blog - share and exchange knowledge, experience and continious learning in digital photography! Hopefully I can gain more experience and knowledge thru this blog and to improve further in digital photography! Cheers! posted by cheewooi at 6:38 AM 0 comments
