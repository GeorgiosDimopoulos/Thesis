Before getting to math, I would like to mention September 11, as it impacted my family.
Also, thanks for everything, Bob Edwards. It's been a great run. It will be strange not hearing you say "This is 'Morning Edition' from NPR News. I'm Bob Edwards."

Who am I? Steve Haataja Graduate Teaching Assistant Office: AvH 228 (The Math Dept. has moved to Avery Hall now.) Phone: (402)-472-8094 Email: shaataja@math.unl.edu B.S. Black Hills State University, 1985 M.S. University of Nebraska, 1987 
I was an assistant professor at Augustana College in the early 90's, and later worked in the computer industry. But now I'm back into academia--and loving it.
Research interests 
My research is in inverse semigroup theory and operator algebras; my co-advisors are John Meakin and Allan Donsig. Specifically I study the structure of C*-algebras of inverse semigroups. Naturally this work starts with Alan Paterson's book Groupoids, Inverse Semigroups, and their Operator Algebras and related papers. The interplay between ideas and techniques of inverse semigroup theory and operator theory is quite fascinating!
Summer 2004 will consist mostly of working on, and typing up my dissertation. Other activities include the Analysis qualifier review sessions (May 10 to May 21), helping with the computers during the big Math Department move (June 11 to June 19), and performing clerical duties for the International Journal of Algebra and Computation, for which John Meakin is a managing editor.
A few links, just in case you don't get enough already.
A few pictures of family and friends. 
How to frighten me

Have you ever wondered which Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics you are? (Face up to it. You've been bothered by this question for a long time.) Well, it turns out there is a way to find out. Take The Springer GTM test. I happen to be Hartshorne's Algebraic Geometry, of all things. I would have hoped to be Mac Lane's Categories for the Working Mathematician, but there you have it.
Weather conditions, whether you want them or not. You can obtain weather information for other places from Weather Underground.
 	 	
Finally, although my web pages may be drab and boring, they do conform to standards. The W3C HTML Validation Service reports no errors when my web pages are checked. At least that was true when I checked them on June 3, 2004. More recent edits might contain errors, so you might find that one or more of my pages fail the test.
