The Village  
It’s been a while since I stayed in a village. And it seemed the people in the village hadn’t strayed out for a while longer. “Yes that’s your key. It’s got one of those swipe card things on it, good isn’t it!” came the voice from the receptionist, stroke barmaid, stoke cook, stroke cleaner. Well I guess it was impressive for a small hotel. It really was great that this credit card siized piece of plastic could act as my door key. In theory I could put it in my wallet with my other credit card size things for safe keeping. It’s just I couldn’t. Attached to this credit card swipe key was a solid ten inch plastic key fob. I suppose I could put the ‘key card’ in my wallet, it’s just the key fob was twice as big as it.“Okay” I said. “I’m coming back around 1am, that will be alright wont it?” I probed. And with that I got a look of astonishment. A look as if I was to break the ‘no going out after dark’ rule on page five in the Almondsbury village rule book. As well as breaking that rule I was also discrediting the local pub, was it not good enough for a nights entertainment?Once she recovered from the astonishment that I was actually leaving the village, she paused, then tried to remember the protocol for after twelve arrivals. Obviously it had been a long time since anyone dared come back after twelve, let along leave the sacred village.“Well you see, the door can be quite temperamental. Some times it just doesn’t work. But normally that isn’t a problem as the night porter is here till twelve. But you want to come back after twelve so he wont be here” she added. Not only had they completely missed the point of having a credit card sized key (with ten inch key fob) but they sort of missed the point about what a key is designed for. To open doors. Without other people having to be there.When I reached my room I started to see why they were having problems with their new door key technology. “Key card solutions, local solutions for local businesses” read the sign on the door reader. It looked like it had been the product of a Technology project for the local secondary school. And true to form, sixteen swipes later, the door finally opened. Of course the curiosity got the better of me, not only did it take sixteen swipes to open my door, but five to open the store room along the corridor, and three to open room number six opposite. They were now missing another point, keys are really meant to open just your door, not every other room in the hotel.Maybe I was being a bit harsh. The staff were friendly, I had complimentary biscuits. Complimentary shampoo. In fact I was so emerged in the complimentary compliments that I suddenly forgot the whole reason why I was staying in this hotel in the first place. I had to be at a birthday party in an hour. I went down to the reception, stroke bar, stoke restaurant to ask the waiter, stoke barman, stroke receptionist, stroke cleaner, stroke manager if they could order me a taxi as soon as possible. Then I forgot. I was in a village.“Taxi, you want a taxi?” came the response. It was if nobody had ever needed to leave this village before. “You want one now you say?”, this time giving me the look as if I had just asked for a steak and fries in a Sushi restaurant. After looking at his glazed stare for what seemed like minutes, I decided maybe it would be better if I ordered the taxi myself. With this he handed me a sheet of paper with all the taxi companies on it. Progress.I dialled the first taxi company. “Hello” came the voice. “Hello, is that a taxi company?” I asked. “Where do you want to go?” the voice replied. “Winterbourne” I responded. With the sound of astonishment as if I had just ordered peas to go with my steak and fries in the Sushi restaurant, came an eternal pause. The voice replied “Oh no, I don’t think I can help you there my friend, you really need to book it a day in advance, I could take you at ten o’clock as a favour though?”. As much as I appreciated his act of goodwill, it was now six o’clock. Waiting four hours for a taxi seemed a little excessive. I phoned the next number,With the muffled scream of kids in the background, the answer came back “Well you see, first I’ve got to take the kids to the cinema, then I’ve got to pick the missus up from Bingo, then I’ve got to have my dinner, what about nine thirty?”. It seemed the ‘taxi companies’ were no more than men driving around in their cars, answering their mobiles and taking people when it fitted in with their social calendar for that evening. Much as I appreciated John’s honesty in telling me that I couldn’t go now as his wife was at the bingo, it wasn’t helping me get to where I wanted to be. After ten calls I put the ‘taxi company’ sheet down and drove myself. Maybe I could book a taxi now, with plenty of notice, to drop me to my car in the evening. I waked back that night. I needed six hours notice apparently if I wanted to get a taxi back. But at least I managed to get in, with twenty six swipes. I love villages.Definitionvillage noun [C]a group of houses and other buildings, such as a church, a school and some shops, which is smaller than a town, usually in the countryside:a fishing villagea mountain villagea village shopa village green (= an area of grass in the middle of a village)Many people come from the outlying/surrounding villages to work in the town.Now Almondsbury is'nt that silly sounding, but these villages are........-Compton Pauncefoot (near Yeovil)-Germansweek (near Launceston)-Goosnargh (north of Preston)-Haselbury Plucknett (near Yeovil)-Helions Bumpstead (near Saffron Walden)-Hopton Wafers (east of Ludlow)-Huish Episcopi near (Langport, Somerset)-Kettlesing Bottom (west of Harrogate, North Yorkshire)-Mabe Burnthouse (Falmouth, Cornwall)-Nempnett Thrubwell (between Bath and Weston super Mare)-Pratt's Bottom (near Farnborough)-Ryme Intrinsica (near Yeovil)-Six Mile Bottom (near Cambridge)-Westward Ho (Devon)-Yetts O'Muckhart (east of Stirling)The delightful 'Bowl Inn', pub, stroke hotel thing in Almondsbury near Bristolthe village churchA typical village house  posted by coops @ 6:03 PM    6 comments

Room 101  
Ok, I took the idea from Single Girl who took it from Dan's Blog. But here goes....1) I wanted to be a professional tennis player when I was younger. This dream started to fade when I played every Saturday at Crowstone tennis club. Sometimes I played eighty year olds and my standards started to drop. 2) The first women I ever fancied (and wanted to marry according to my mum) was Olivia Newton-John after watching 'Greece' at the age of five. It was comforting to know that even then I could tell that a woman in a black all in one suit, would make good marriage material, a belief I still hold today. 3) I'm not married. See Number 2 for reason. 4) I have never consciously eaten fish. I was fed 'chicken' fingers from a young age, when in fact they were fish. This in turn led me to a deep psychological distrust of all things fish to which still scares me today. 5) I like to use stories like (see #4) to make me feel better about being fussy. I'm not lying, I was fed 'chicken fingers', but saying some story like that sounds a lot better at the restaurant then saying "I'm fussy, fish stinks". 6) I've always lived by the sea (Southend, Portsmouth and Bournemouth), and always will look to live by the sea despite not knowing why. 7) I'm not really into doing anything on the water, despite always wanting to live by it. This is even stranger considering that my dad grew up on a surfboard, lived as a lifeguard, and sailed to the shops. But not so strange when you consider the only times my dad has taken me out to sea, we have sunk. 8) I went Scuba Diving for the first time last year, and nearly drowned. When you combine q phobia of fish (see #4) and my experiences of water (see #7) you don't get a good result. Add friends trying to make you laugh underwater and minimal training, and you get panic and near death. 9) I am not religious, but receptive to spiritual things. I believe in reincarnation,. The spirit world and regression. I have been to mediums and been convinced by their authenticity. On my last visit he said I was going to be 'incredibly wealthy' and 'a guidance for others'. 10) I've just looked at my bank statement. Please ignore #9. 11) I'm addicted to walking. I own a car, it's just I now walk everywhere where feasible. My ambition is to emulate Sir Ian Botham's charity walk from Lands End in the south to the tip of Scotland, in my flip flops from Australia (they have moulded to my feet and are the most comfortable things in the world). 12) My biggest ever achievement is winning the 1989 Centre Parks Holiday round robin tennis singles competition. I won a fake cup and a chocolate bar. I since decided that because I did not specify winning Wimbledon in #1, this was the next best thing. 13) I won a national competition run by Ford in 1992, designing new features that tomorrow's cars would have. They rejected my 'reverse parking sensor' as a 'bit unrealistic'. Two years later Ford implemented a 'reverse parking sensor' without my permission. 14) I refuse to ever drive or purchase a Ford (see #13). 15) I always have a tendency to buy cars with my heart and not my head. As a result I spend most of money keeping the things on the road, despite my addiction described in #11. 16) I have a upper honours degree in I.T and Psychology. I guess that means I can design things that can go wrong, but in theory I should have analysed why it went wrong before it did.17) I recently achieved an objective I set myself in 1997, to bench press my own body weight. Okay, eight years late, but Rome wasn't built in one day, more like 752 and nobody complains about that. 18) The type of women I go for are Kristy Gallagher, Kelly Daglish and Kirsten Dunst. It helps if they are intelligent, genuine, low maintenance and got a sense of humour.19) I’m currently single (see #18)20) The worst thing that ever happened to me was a broken wrist when I was sixteen. Not spectacular in itself, although playing a three set, league tennis match with a broken wrist was. I thought it was sore, but didn’t want to make a fuss. We lost the game, mainly because I could'nt serve.21) My favourite beer is Stella Artois, at 5.2%, one of the strongest beers available, but I just like it for its taste.22) I suffer from memory loss on a lot of nights out (see #21)23) I hate dancing, unless I’m pretty drunk.24) I tend to frown at women, not smile, if I like them (see #19).25) I rarely make the first move, even with encouragement (see #19).26) The last girl I was with was called Anna, she was Dutch. She made the first move.27) I currently fancy eight women in my office. It will stay that way unless they make the first move.28) I regularly keep in contact with five Canadians, two Dutch, one Swede and one German.29) I’m not a big fan of one night stands, not for moral reasons, just because I don’t get a lot (two night stands on the other hand maybe, although that hand would get sore).30) I’m a football(soccer) addict. I currently support statistically the worse team (Southend) in England over the past ten year, and I’m proud of it.31) My biggest ever win on the lottery was ten pounds. Of course I invested it straight back.32) My mum used to be a school teacher, my dad a lifeguard come account. 33) I have got a brother who is 30, a sister of 28 and I’m the youngest at 26. 34) I don’t really like my name, that’s why I’m known as Coops. Rich is okay though. Well it’s okay when you don’t get people saying “SO are you Rich then?!”. Ha ha.35) I hate big egos and falseness.36) I got my tongue pierced as a result of a dare in New Zealand. I just haven’t got around to taking it out yet.37) I need two fillings. I just haven’t got round to sorting them out yet38) My car needs some work done on it, I just haven’t got round to doing it yet.39) I tend to put things off quite a lot if I they can wait (see #37 and #38)40) I’m half Kiwi thanks to my dad. Thanks to my mum I was brought up in England.41) I used to worry a lot. Now I just don’t care.42) I worry sometimes that I am so stress free43) I contradict myself quite a lot (see #42 and #43).44) I have an IQ of 131, yet sometimes I forget the smimplest things, like setting my alarm.45) I hate anything Sci-Fi.46) I don’t really read fiction books, only fact based ones.47) I like any sort of Music, from Nine Inch Nails, to dance, to soul, to bands to classical.48) 'The office' and 'Little Britain' are my favourite comedies of all time.49) Steve Coogan is my favourite ever comic, his character Alan Partridge being a comedy masterpiece and my biggest influence on my life.50) Bill Byron is my favourite writer and biggest influence.51) I suddenly became addicted to writing when I read ‘Down Under’, promptly causing me to quit my job and go travelling.52) Thailand remains a taboo subject. So don't ask about it!53) I have fallen asleep twice at the cinema. Watching 'Star Wars Phantom Menace' and 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' (Both times against my will).54) I walked into the wrong cinema once and sat in the front row for a film that was ten minutes from the end. Then walked out again two minutes later.55) My great, great Granddad was the Lord Mayor of London. He changed history, he fell off his horse whilst being drunk, since then Lord Mayors have never been allowed to ride by horseback.56) I have seen a ghost. When I was fifteen I saw a girl standing at the end of my bed. When my mum consulted the man who used to live in my house, he confirmed his daughter died in my bedroom at the age of six.57) I had my first cigarette when I was sixteen, drunk. I proceeded to smoke it the wrong way round and burnt my mouth. If only I had taken the hint at the time.58) I smoked my last cigarette ten years to the day later in Sydney. I gave up after being ill for a week, and have never looked back.59) I passed my driving test after 12 lessons, booking myself in early by ‘mistake’.

The way it should be  
Following on from my When Things in life were simple post, I recieved some good news that from next year, life will be reversed. Expect to see this in the news soon, I think it's a good move personally, abeit to late for me. p.s thanks to my lovely friend Natalie for that, reminded me of that particular Seinfield episode.  posted by coops @ 10:17 AM    3 comments

il y a un singe vers le haut de l'arbre  
My chances of acquiring a visa to live in Canada rely on a monkey living up a tree. Some people get rejected due to lack of work skills, insufficient education, a criminal record, insufficient funds or the immigration pen pusher in the office just having a bad day. But for good old me, it’s all about a monkey in a tree.I like exploring my options. If I can work somewhere, I will try and have ago. I applied to become a New Zealand citizen last year, and got it. Okay, maybe it was more to do with my Dad being from New Zealand, and okay, I didn’t actually work in New Zealand or Australia, but it meant I could. But Canada is proving to be a tough nut to crack. These people are really fussy when it comes to opening the door, just like my late Auntie Hilda, they just don’t let anyone in. And they pretend to be out in case you do call by. Now all this could be slightly premature. I mean I’ve never been to Canada, I haven’t even booked my flights yet. But, what’s the worse that can happen? Just like peering through the windows and seeing a plate of homemade biscuits sitting on Auntie Hilda's table, I’m tempted, even if she doesn’t want to open the door.So, here we go. How did that monkey get up the tree? Well, I’m on sixty seven points in the first phase of my application. The online points calculator asks you lots of questions, point scoring you on the way. Okay, I scored nil points on having family in Canada. Well, I don’t think I have got any family in Canada, I do get drunk quite a lot and suffer from chronic memory loss. Maybe a mini Coops could show their face and give me five extra points. I continued to lose five points for having no pre-arranged employment, five points for having never studied there and another five points for having never worked there before. I scored a big fat zero overall in the ‘Adaptability’ section then, these guys think I’m going to suffer from culture shock. That’s nonsense, I’ve watched Due South and I’m learning about Degrassi High, what do they know? Some people.So it looks like Auntie Hilda’s not in. But just as I walk back down the path, I see a light come on in the kitchen. I score top marks for work experience, good scores for education, top marks for my age group and top marks for my knowledge of the English language, althgh sme peple may grass me up on tht won.The door is opening, I can smell the cakes. I even passed the biggest test, having by the time of arrival, the 9,420 dollars they think I will need to support myself, cause they don’t want to. So my shoes are clean, I don't want to mark her beige carpet. I’m nearly there. Sixty seven points to get in, sixty seven points in my pocket. Then the dreaded the question “Have you done your homework?”.It seems my application could all depend on me being ambitious, ticking the ‘basic in French’ box and getting two points, or being a little more realistic and ticking the ‘Not really that good at French to be honest despite France being across the water” box and scoring no points (or points de zero maybe I should be saying). Now “il y a un singe vers le haut de l'arbre “ is one of the only French phrases I can remember from my three years of learning French at school. If I tick the ‘basic’ box, I will rely quite a lot on this expression if I’m tested. Maybe I’ll get away with the ‘Can describe a situation, tell a simple story, describe the process of obtaining essential goods’ part with my monkey knowledge. Quite why I have retained possibly the most useless expression is rather strange. It was probably the thought ‘Why the hell are we learning how to say there is a monkey up a tree’ in my green blazer days that made me remember this expression. I mean it is a pretty useless things to learn, unless of course I was working in Parisian Zoo, telling Monkey lovers to look up.So that it. After answering more questions than a Spanish Inquisitor on speed, it could be down to whether or not I say I can use basic French. I’ll put down basic. After all, how people can say 'there is a Monkey up the tree' in French. But just like saying I had done my homework to Aunty Hilda, I know I'll get caught out later  posted by coops @ 4:49 PM    4 comments

Things I’ve noticed at work this week……………  
I don’t get the lift up to the third floor anymore. It seems I’m the only one that doesn’t. Maybe it’s my conscious effort to do exercise. Maybe it’s the fact that you seem to wait ages for a lift that never comes. Maybe it’s the forced silence, triggered by the personal space invasion. Maybe I’ve had enough of those guilty looks when someone says “I did press the up button” when the lift suddenly starts to drop. Maybe I have got tired of the “no you go first, no after you” routine. Or maybe it’s the office whispers of lift failures causing twenty minute entrapments (I’ve already decided there is only a 2% chance of being stuck in a lift with someone I actually want to be stuck in with, and 100% of them work on the ground floor). Or most probably it’s my inability to cope with my unnerving ability to snigger when I’m not meant to. And I’m not talking about when a women asks me “are you going down” (they stopped doing that after I smiled too many times).I had two cups of coffee in my hand, so I decided to take the lift. It seemed a good idea at the time, there was no one else there. I had it all to myself. Then the crowd came. It turned into one of those “oh, is there room for a small one” type situations as we crammed in the lift. Silence. Some people looked at their phones, some people looked at the walls, some people looked at their feet. First Floor, Second Floor, oh dear. Oh no. The silence was broken by Flatulence. Then the silence was worse than silence, everybody came the accused. My snigger broke the silence, a snigger that could be construed as a guilty snigger. I was biting my lip but I could see the victim, a deeper shade of red. I felt sorry for them. Okay, maybe I didn’t feel sorry for them.The lift doors opened. Everyone scampered. I’ll be taking the stairs from nowI’ve also noticed.............The huge amount of people coming in for interviews every day, sitting in reception first thing in the morning. Yes, the nervous ones. I don’t know what they have got to be nervous about. It’s not like my interview last year for the furniture store Ikea. Some people.  posted by coops @ 10:26 PM    5 comments
