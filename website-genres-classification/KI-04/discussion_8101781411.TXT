My friend has safari 1.0 installed on his mac. I was recently using it, and found a clutter of old websites poping up in the text bar. So, I cleared his history. They still appeared. I reset Safari. Still there. I tried internet explorer, and the same problem occured. My friend has gotten in trouble with his parents in the past for "bad habits" in the past, but my friend claims they are not technologcally advanced enough to install spyware. However, I have my doubts. If this is spyware, how can where can the extension/keylogger file be found?

You can get a spyware detector from these guys http://macscan.securemac.com/ . But you are probably right about the parents. Maybe you could give a bit more description on where this stuff is showing up.

try resetting the cache as well. it stores websites u vists often images, and other things so the pages load faster. u could also try deleting safari and all support files and the like and geting a new copy. theforce_________________here¬ís to the crazy ones. the misfits. the rebels. the troublemakers. the round pegs in the square holes. the ones who see things differently. they¬íre not fond of rules.

Clearing the history won't help. It's used for one thing only, and that's for going back to sights you've been to recently, like the History menu in Safari and the history bar in IE. The URLs you want to get rid of are stored in the cache, I think._________________-----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK----- Version: 3.12 GAT/FA/O d s-:++ a18 C++++ U*+++ P L+ E- W+++ N o? K? !w--- !O M++ V?

Safari uses the History for Auto-fill, which I think is what the problem is. If, after clearing the History (History menu > Clear History), the location bar still auto-fills with the links, look through all the bookmarks (Bookmarks menu > Show All Bookmarks). Find and delete the naughty bookmarks.
