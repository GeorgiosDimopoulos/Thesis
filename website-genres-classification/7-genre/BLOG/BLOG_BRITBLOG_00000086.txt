Each night, for the past week, there is this dream:myself, in a chair, with a book, surrounded, by a circle of people,also in chairs, leaning forward,waiting expectantly, for me to read,but, when I glance at the words, I find,they've skuttled themselves into odd,mysterious configurations, and the punctuation, if any, I can tell you, doesn't help a bit! I look up, with dismay, to my eager listeners,only to discover, they have, each and every one of them,inched their chairs just a wee bit closer,and, this is how it happens, night after night, turning,from the book, to the people,until, they're climbing from their chairs,straight up into my lap--that's when I wake up,grateful, for all these commas,the hooks that keep me sane.

Died on a Friday 
I've seen you for the last time, I know this, and in the instant I knew I swore you would not leave me that way Without acknowledgement Without a gift So you could say that this new body I'm wearing Every day this new skin I step intoI've made it your giftAnd the old one shedLike Eustace peeling off the dragon's skinWell he had helpThe lion put his velvet paws his divine clawsTo the boy's heart and let her ripAlone, I have only that Outsider KnowledgeOf the man you were becomingAnd dance tunes from our loving daysOnce I cut my hair too shortBecause I thought you'd like itSee, even with our talk we weren't any better than anyoneNow there is more, and lessI am swimming-pool clean, emergingAnd just what it is I amHas a new hostAnd new eyes, think of itThe eyes you kissed them twelve years gone they're newAll this without youAlthough I do thank youAnd goodbye
