Introduction
The basic idea behind this homepage is to present to you some of the best short written works I have encountered. They are chosen based on my personal taste...literary style or authorship takes no precedence.
  
The authors
The authors chosen above were great philosophers, politicians or teachers in their respective lifetimes. Their works reflect their personalities and principles that have earned them the respect of millions, even today decades after their deaths.
