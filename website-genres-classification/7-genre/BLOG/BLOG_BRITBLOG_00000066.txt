Flipped and Crushed
It was slow motion as I crossed the other lane of the highway. I almost had it. I was feeling relieved and then woooooosh. I was spinning. Hanging upside down in my beloved truck, surrounded by glass and Tulah. Tulah seemed ok. That's when the Dyna Mind took over. Thet truck was upside down, spewing oil, motor running. Within a second I had undone my seatbelt and Tulah and I crawled out through the window.My truck was cruched, caved in, and flipped upside down. Where was there room for a body in there? I couldn't see how I fit in the mangled cab. Where would my head fit? Horrified people began to stop. One man witnessed the roll in his rearview mirror. "Did anyone make it out alive?" another man asked. My coworkers pulled over already cryiong from the wreckage.I walked away without a scratch. Nothing. Against all odds. No bitten lip. No bumped head. No soreness from my seatbelt or steering wheel. I was released from the emergency with the nurse's words ringing in my ears, "You are lucky to be alive. I am glad you're alive."All I am today is sore in the back. Tulah goes to the doctor at 9:30 this morning. Thank you DJ KOOL for driving us. It's a miracle, she seems to be fine, too, except for some open stitches.I have alot to deal with today...Highway Patrol, Insurnace, and coming to grips withwhat happened to me on that fateful Monday, 3-14-05. // posted by Dyna Girl @ 7:55 AM postCount('111090268159263538'); Comments | postCountTB('111090268159263538'); Trackback

Pretty in Pink
Today I dressed in pink. Complete with my blingin' pink jewels. I ate a donought with pink icing. When I got to work, my collegue was wearing pink, too. We both were presented with beautiful boquets of pink tulips.You see, today, we got our pink slips. The superintendant came out to lay us off in person. It was actually the first time I had ever met him. I have heard tales of tears. I think for me it was different. I knew I was getting a pink slip since the day I was hired. It was no surprise, no shock. Beside, the flowers are gorgoeus.I am pretty confident I will be hired back and that eases the stress. In the meantime, what's to do? Freak the fuck out? No thanks. I joked with the super, I mean, the pink slips were PURPLE, for crying out loud! I think he was relieved the rookie didn't bawl. I got home and Mama E said she was worried about Tulah. I went to check her, loaded her in the truck and headed straight for the vet. She had been scratching her sutures and tore the end of the drainage tube right off. The vet said she was ready to have it removed, so out it came. Now she has to wear a t-shirt 24-7 to soften the blows from her claws. She is doing well, and I am so proud of My Girl.Urban Outfitters delivered my blinds today! SCORE! They look dopalicious. 3 sets, and I look damn grown up, if I do say so myself. Auntie CC is coming over. I miss her, time to catch up. // posted by Dyna Girl @ 4:54 PM postCount('111050395251373142'); Comments | postCountTB('111050395251373142'); Trackback

911
I got a call at work yesterday that there was an emergency at my house. This is what it was, and nobody knows how it happened...my poor, poor girl. I brought her to work today and she can come tomorrow, thanks to my wonderful principal. Thursday and Friday she'll be home, poor thing. My heart aches for her and my stomach...well, let's just say if I don't throw up keeping this mess clean, it will be a miracle. Hug your babes, whatever creature they may be. Freak accidents happen. // posted by Dyna Girl @ 5:05 PM postCount('111033075096874963'); Comments | postCountTB('111033075096874963'); Trackback

Insufficient
No, I do not believe one post per week is adequate. Funny, I don't even remember where all the time that composed last week went. I have been thinking lately. A lot. I have been thinking through old pains and trying to strategically avoid future injury. I don't mean those course of life pains...I mean the kind you can at least mediate or head off at the pass. In the midst of all the people, even when it sucks and your feelings are hurt, I have been thinking about how much you really get by not closing yourself completely off...my normal reaction. I have been spending time with some new friends, and getting to know some better. Even if everyone left a big turd on my head tomorrow, these are some things I have been exposed to, thanks to their presence:There really are adults out there who are responsible and young at heart.Being in a highly organized space feels really, really good.There is so much incredible music out there that I haven't accessed.There is immense beauty in very pure tequila. The devil is absent from this delightful intoxicant.I drink too much. (yes, I do see the irony in the above and this revelation)Men with priorities are very sexy.If you drive with the 'technique', you get there faster.Exposure, exposure, exposure. I think that this is why I am sad, but not lost. I usually lock myself away. If you actually get out a little, you get fed things to make you feel better, to sustain you. So, despite the pain risk factor, there is so much to be said for basically decent people, and it feels much richer to be alive with a sense of gratitude. The glass is, indeed, half full at my house. // posted by Dyna Girl @ 3:52 PM postCount('111015393274521826'); Comments | postCountTB('111015393274521826'); Trackback

Juggling
Tossing ideas around, never able to hold on to one long enough to get a good take on it. The balls in the air are:I have realized:I make too much coffee in the morning, it is not mandatory to brew a full pot. Who'd have thought??????????????????I use too much coffee...it tastes much better with 2 spoons less.I really wish I could make people behave and feel the way I want them to. Somewere in between leaving a relationship too early with questions and too late with resentment, comes the time you should go.When you have 3 dogs, you kind of have to be stickler about rules. I hate seeing them look like, "Shit! She's pissed!" grovel grovel*, but if you don't, they run your life and can't go anywhere. Luckily, the Dears are learning QUICKLY and we are enjoying a very quality relationship together. We can hang all day if they know how to behave.I have a dark fear that I wll never live happily ever after. Not in the fairy tale way, just happily married with some kids and a house that I own. Luckily, the pounds are always overflowing with ctas. I believe at 40 I will begin to adopt them at the rate of one per month.I am trying hard not to watch what other people have going on, or are doing, and compare myself. That's really hard and generally leaves me with an infreiority complex.So, juggling away, I am , I am.Yesterday I had a nice day. Waiting for a call that never came, I took the dogs out to the beach. I was there forever. The rains have brought in all kinds of crazy wood to shore. I love checking it all oput, and imagining if I can use them for anything. I ended up sitting on a huge washed up trunk juggling some more. It was warm, and sunny and I felt pretty damn good.Today, I want to drive up the coast towards Big Sur. I have to go by Blondie's to get my guitars. I think it would be great to let the dogs frolic while I screw around on the guitar. We'll see, though. It would probably be better to go local to the beach and keep dicking around the house. IN fact, as I write, I think I ought to do that, instead.Next weekend there is a show in Santa Cruz, so maybe I'll go check it out and take HWY 1 through Big Sur. The girl I might go with plays as well, so we could stop and rock the fuck out. Ok, ideas are beginning to start pouring, and I have a date with dirty dishes.I love you. // posted by Dyna Girl @ 9:49 AM postCount('110952728897024327'); Comments | postCountTB('110952728897024327'); Trackback

Insomnia City
I haven't been able to sleep. Well, actually, I can't fall asleep easily, and when I eventually do, it's for about an hour. I woke up so many damn times last night. My mind is too full. Somehow, I need to process really fast or rein it in before I forget soemthing big at work etc. I know they say you aren't supposed to lay there in bed, so I almost got up and posted. Trouble was, the heater was on in the bedroom and the living roon was like the Arctic Circle.I had a fabulous weekend. SBB, CraftD, Dog Mama, DJ Kool, and lil' ole me in the city. I also got loads done around the house. which, as you know, is a huge weight off my shoulders.Tonight I am setting aside for myself and not another living being (excepts my pets). I want to (and probably won't have the energy to) clean the bathroom and take a nice soak in the tub, watch a movie and take a sleep aid! IN the meantime, I have coffee and there is work to be done with the Youth. After the long weekend, I am actually looking forward to seeing them.It's garbage day, so I have to to have time to get h bins out. Write something glorious today, because come nightfall, I'll a come a'readin'. // posted by Dyna Girl @ 6:02 AM postCount('110908133251808133'); Comments | postCountTB('110908133251808133'); Trackback
