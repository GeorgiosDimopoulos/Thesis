I am a first year PhD student in Financial Economics at the Sloan School of Management , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying as a Fulbright scholar. Previously I spent two years in the investment banking division of Morgan Stanley in London, latterly focusing on UK financial institutions. This explains my research interests in applied corporate finance (M&A and international bank capital regulation); I am also interested in international monetary and exchange rate policy coordination. Prior to Morgan Stanley, I studied Economics and Management at Merton College, Oxford. Between the ages of 13 and 18 I attended St. Paul's School, London where I took A-levels in Economics, English, German and Maths. My formative years were at Dolphin School in Berkshire, where I learnt many things for which I am extremely grateful. 
In my spare time I run, row, play soccer, various racket sports, and the piano and cello. I was a season ticket holder at Reading Football Club for 5 years, and am rapidly becoming a fan of the Boston Red Sox. I serve on the government of my residence hall as Athletics Chair, am a member of the Toastmasters public speaking society and am interested in American history, politics and economic policy.
