                                              Posing like a twat
Sunday, March 13th, 2005, late evening                            
So I had JN take a few photos of me, as I wanted something to use in a bit of a redesign on this here site. Mostly as expected, a bit crap, after all they do involve me, and I have a morbid fear of losing my spirit to the camera, must be the Cherokee part of me or something. Anyway some of them turned out quite amusingly, as this here example shows.
Get the &#8216;big&#8217; version and you can see I appear to have gone a bit &#8220;Scanner&#8221; like, and if you look carefully it&#8217;s possible to see my second (or is it my third?) chin hanging over the collar of my shirt. The shirt incidentally had an amusing message, which unfortunately can&#8217;t be read.
Anyway, just thought you might like an image of my good self to perv over or something, I know what you internet types are like.

My subscription to Digiguide has just run out and I really don&#8217;t want to pay for another year, it&#8217;s good don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s just I don&#8217;t really want to fork out for something that can be got elsewhere on the web for free. Besides most digital setups now have a tv guide of sorts built in, unfortunately I still haven&#8217;t sorted out the tv aerial situation and so don&#8217;t have a good enough reception to get the guide working well on my telly.
I was having a look at xmltv and that seems like the solution, it just needs a good frontend, I&#8217;ve seen Freeguide, but I&#8217;m not sure about it as it runs on Java, which could mean it&#8217;s a bit unstable and quite likely to look ropey as well. If anyone has any ideas about a good tv guide solution, even a completely web driven one, such as tvguide, please tell me. Even if you have used another guide and found it shit, tell me so that I can keep away from it.
I suppose I should get around to building a nice MythTV box, as that would really solve a lot of problems, but it could create one of having a noisy pc in the living room, ah well.

Excellent news! Well this blog will have to be short, as I have to nip off and keep myself healthy. As you do. Hat tip to Scott D. Feldstein for commenting here and pointing me in that direction.

Woops, I only just checked the comments area in here to see if any shitty poker scam maiols were waiting to be deleted, when I noticed a few legitimate comments waiting to get through. Needless to say they have been okayed now, and those people should never be moderated automatically again, as long as the same details are used anyway. Bizarrely when I checked I noticed that a poker comment had actually got through this and through spaminator, which was odd.

A bunch of cockney wankers parading about, playing at being Arthur Daley, but with drugs. And guns. Thatâ€™s what I was expecting, thatâ€™s not what I got.
There a few nods towards the stereotype of Guy Ritchiesâ€™ first two films, but that could be due to the producer of those films being the director of this one, Mathew Vaughn. Not the usual move in the film world, from producer to director, itâ€™s usually the other way round, but Vaughn manages to pull it off confidently. Of course it could also be due to the fact that the source novel actually contains these clichÃ©d characters anyway.
It revolves around Daniel Craigsâ€™ nameless coke dealer, ready to quit the whole game with one last payoff, but dragged into a world of back-stabbing and double dealing when he is asked to track down a missing girl and sell a million eâ€™s. This sets it up for a great British gangster film, it made me think much more of Get Carter (the original obviously) or The Long Good Friday, than it did of Lock Stock or Snatch. The only problem that I had with it was that Vaughn, like Ritchie, used too many flashy camera angles, I donâ€™t need to see people filmed from under a glass coffee table. Maybe there is a repressed memory there.
I donâ€™t think that it is nearly as good as either of those films stated earlier, but itâ€™s definitely a good start, hopefully Vaughn can move on from here as a director and not become a ridiculed cockney munt married to an ex-popstar.
Whilst getting the picky for this I noticed that it had sadly been packaged with Snatch, which I donâ€™t think will do it any favours, having said that I quite liked Snatch, and I would think that most people who are into it will probably like this film as well, itâ€™s just that I believe this to be a much smarter, more serious film than that.

So this is really quite amusing, (watch the slideshow or the video) it seems that the featured Japanese zoo like to have rehearsals for the emergency situation of an animal escaping by dressing up someone as an animal then hunting them down, tranquillising them (I presume they don&#8217;t do that bit for real), and moving them safely back to their enclosure. All just looks like a mad bugger in a lion suit having a lark at the zoo, didn&#8217;t JN say he went to Wales on holiday?
