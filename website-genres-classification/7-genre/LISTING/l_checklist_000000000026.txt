Nursing Home Checklist
Printable-Version	 	
 
Checklists can help you evaluate the nursing homes that you call or visit. Use a new checklist for each home you call or visit. Then, compare the scores. This will help you select a nursing home that is a good choice for you or your relative. 
Nursing Home Name: _________________________________________ 
Date Visited: __________________________ 
Address: ______________________________________________ 
1.    Basic Information   
2.  Is the facility Medicare certified?:____(yes) _____(no) 
3.  Is the facility Medicaid certified?:____(yes) _____(no) 
4.  Is this a skilled nursing facility?:____(yes) _____(no)
5.  Is the facility accepting new patients?:____(yes) _____(no)
6.  Is there a waiting period for admission?:____(yes) _____(no)
7.  Is a skilled bed available to you?:____(yes) _____(no)     
Useful Tips   
* Generally, skilled nursing care is available only for a short period    of time after a hospitalization. Custodial care is for a much    longer period of time. If a facility offers both types of care, learn    if residents may transfer between levels of care within the nursing    home without having to move from their old room or from the    nursing home. 
* Nursing homes that only take Medicaid residents might offer    longer term but less intensive levels of care. Nursing Homes that    don't accept Medicaid payment may make a resident move when    Medicare or the resident’s own money runs out. 
* An occupancy rate is the total number of residents currently living    in a nursing home divided by the home’s total number of beds.    Occupancy rates vary by area, depending on the overall number of    available nursing home beds.   
     
 
*   Nursing Home Information:   
1.  Is the home and the current administrator licensed?:____(yes)     _____(no)
2.  Does the home conduct background checks on all staff?:____(yes)    _____(no)
3.  Does the home have special services units?:____(yes) _____(no)
4.  Does the home have abuse prevention training?:____(yes) _____(no)   
Useful Tips   
* LICENSURE: The nursing home and its administrator should be   licensed by the State to operate. 
* BACKGROUND CHECKS: Do the nursing home’s procedures to screen   potential employees for a history of abuse meet your State’s   requirements? Your State’s Ombudsman program might be able to   help you with this information. 
* SPECIAL SERVICES: Some nursing homes have special service units    like rehabilitation, Alzheimer's, and hospice. Learn   if there are separate waiting periods or facility guidelines for when   residents would be moved on or off the special unit.
* STAFF TRAINING: Do the nursing home’s training programs educate   employees about how to recognize resident abuse and neglect,   how to deal with aggressive or difficult residents, and how to deal   with the stress of caring for so many needs? Are there clear   procedures to identify events or trends that might lead to abuse   and neglect, and on how to investigate, report, and resolve your   complaints? 
* LOSS PREVENTION: Are there policies or procedures to safeguard   resident possessions?

Nursing Home Compare Information on Nursing Staff
Caring, competent nursing staff who respect each resident and family member are   very important in assuring that residents get needed care and enjoy the best   possible quality of life. Adequate nursing staff is needed to assess resident needs,   plan and give them care, and help them with eating, bathing and other activities.   Some residents (e.g., those who are more dependent in eating or who are bedfast) need   more help than other residents depending on their conditions.
The combinations of registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical and   vocational nurses (LPNs/LVNs), and certified nursing assistants (CNAs)that nursing   homes may have vary depending on the type of care that residents need and the number   of residents in the nursing home.
* Look at your responses to Questions 2 and 5 in section III above and    Questions 4, 5, and 10 in section IV above. Also look at your responses to    Questions 2 and 7 in section V above.
* Are nursing staff members courteous and friendly to residents and to other    staff?
* Do nursing staff respond timely to residents calls for assistance such as    help getting in and out of bed, dressing and going to the bathroom? 
* Observe meal times. Do all residents who need assistance with eating get    help? Do staff give each resident enough time to chew food thoroughly and    complete the meal?
* Which nursing staff members are involved in planning the residents    individual care? (Are they the same ones who give the care to residents?)
* Ask questions about staff turnover. Is there frequent turnover among    certified nursing assistants (CNAs)? What about nurses and supervisors,    including the Director of Nursing and the Administrator? If staff changes    frequently, ask why.
* While the number of nursing staff is important to good care, also consider    other factors, such as education and training. How many registered nurses (RNs)    are on the staff, and how many available on each shift? What kind of training    do certified nursing assistants (CNAs) receive? How does the nursing home ensure    that all staff receive continuing education and keep their knowledge and skills    up-to-date?
