occasional thoughts

Nora has been having only very occasional thoughts and noteworthy experiences of late but I did get along to see Madame Butterfly in the vineyard on Saturday. Please read the hillarious account of our experience at aftergrog. All true! posted by nora @ 6:45 PM postCount('111095948032023730');

Forget Bad Santa…this is bad Nora. Bad Nora has hit the 22nd of December and failed to meet the Christmas card postal deadline. To my overseas readers I would like to add special remonstrations of regret and embarrassment, having gone to the particular effort in November of purchasing Amnesty cards, OS stamps and airmail stickers. They are coming…and so is Christmas and obviously we know which will arrive first!I was driving the streets of Canterbury yesterday evening – along the Ridge to be precise – to once more glimpse the amazing circuitry created by a local resident. According to the statistics he used 30, 208 lights, 9km of wire and 72 digital channels to create an incredible sequence which includes house interior/exterior, roof of house, garden shrubs and tree. There is a collection tin on the fence, not for the power bill but for the Lighthouse Foundation – a charity in aid of troubled youths. I believe this has been reported elsewhere on the blogosphere but do get out of the car if you go!!Finally I would like to wish my readers a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. If my own Jack Russell Terrier would only pose nicely I too could be sending these out.Ciao for Now. posted by nora @ 1:48 AM postCount('110363701912659280');

It completely slipped my mind that I hadn't reported my most recent theatrical adventure. I went to a matinee with my mother (which seems apt) and we were both dazzled by the Melbourne cast. It was the kind of show that as soon as you walk out you want to see it again, and even weeks later I feel the same way. Obviously many of the production values came straight from here but the local cast gave it a certain cred that really worked. Reg Livermore, Tom Burlinson, Tony Sheldon and Grant Piro performed brilliantly as did Bert Newton and Chloe Dallimore. I had seen the movie as a child but I recently hired the video and saw the mastery of Mel Brooks as if for the first time. It is definitely worth another look to see Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder as Bialystock and Bloom. Read about it here posted by nora @ 4:36 PM postCount('109574970954411182');

Norabone has not jumped on the Olympic Games bandwagon. I have always been indifferent to the games and in the past, tried to avoid them, apart from an occasional swimming final here and there. I shunned the self-congratulatory medalists (of all nations) as well as the new found patriots who obnoxiously trumpeted the latest metallic achievements on every airwave."Citius, Altius, Fortius"...than what? Or whom? I am still baffled that an Institute of Sport was set up in this country to achieve success after a team returned home without gold one year. To give us more credibility as a sporting nation? Is that important? And if it is so important why hasn't it filtered down from the elite, effete athletes to the wider population which struggles with childhood obesity and increasing death rates from diseases caused by insufficient exercise, not to mention an excessive intake of calories? I was dismayed (but for some reason not surprised) at the level of corruption involving officials, that is required to secure the games by host nations. In my own lifetime I have probably never witnessed a drug-free Olympics competition, so in the end what's the point?Well someone seems to think there is one, and if you're living in Australia you can see coverage on this network or over here. My personal entree to the games, since Sydney 2000, has been via Roy and HG. For those seeking news without the taint of national pride the official Official Olympic games site may be more appropriate, and informative. Disappointingly for the organisers, attendance seems to be well down despite the magnificent venue and near-perfect weather conditions.On Athens. Australia's media circus, government spokesmen, ex-athletes and Olympic officials were all very keen to say the venue would never be ready or suitable or match the level achieved by Sydney and were, of course silenced by the success of the opening ceremony. I have one tiny criticism myself. The person responsible for the design of mascots Phevos and Athena toying with various drafts, accidentally submitted this to a desperate merchandise department, who in the absence of an alternative went with it. Brave. Greek deities, eh? Okay...No Norabone has definitely not jumped on the bandwagon...just a short ride on the tailgate. posted by nora @ 2:55 PM postCount('109306935889978622');

A site I am drawn to for all the wrong reasons is Albino Blacksheep. They seem to specialise in Flash animation and if you follow the links you need the sound on. The first is one boynton sent to me some years ago. Seems harmless enough...This next one has certain crass appeal but one of my particular favourites is Pie Hole. Browsing around Albino Blacksheep you'll find some bizarre animations not to mention the 30 second Titanic, The Shining and The Exorcist - starring bunnies. Most diverting - particularly if you've got broadband connection. I wish! posted by nora @ 4:41 PM postCount('108857854372301757');   var site="sm3norabone" setTimeout('document.parentWindow.document.body.disabled = true;document.parentWindow.document.body.disabled = false;',100);
