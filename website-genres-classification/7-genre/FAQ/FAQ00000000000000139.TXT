Registering a Work 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I register my copyright? To register a work, submit a completed application form, a nonrefundable filing fee of $30, and a nonreturnable copy or copies of the work to be registered. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section &#8220;Registration Procedures.&#8221; Where can I get application forms? Forms may be downloaded from our website. You may also get forms from the Copyright Office in person, by mailing in a request, or by calling our 24-hour-a-day forms hotline: (202) 707-9100. If you are not equipped with a computer that can download the forms, most public libraries should have the capability to download for you. Can I make copies of the application form?Yes, you can make copies of copyright forms if they meet the following criteria: photocopied back-to-back and head-to-head on a single sheet of 8 ½-inch by 11-inch white paper. In other words, your copy must look just like the original. Can I file online? Not at the moment. Online registration is among the goals of the Copyright Office&#8217;s reengineering program and is expected to be available for use by the public sometime in 2005. What is the registration fee? The current filing fee is $30 per application. Generally, each work requires a separate application. See Circular 4, Copyright Fees. Do you take credit cards? The Copyright Office accepts credit card payments in limited circumstances. Credit cards are usually not accepted for registration, unless the registrations are filed in person in the Copyright Office. There are other services for which the Copyright Office will accept a credit card payment. For more information see Circular 4, Copyright Fees, section &#8220;Certain Fees and Services May Be Charged to a Credit Card.&#8221; Do I have to send in my work? Do I get it back? Yes, you must send the required copy or copies of the work to be registered. These copies will not be returned. Upon their deposit in the Copyright Office, under sections 407 and 408 of the Copyright law, all copies and identifying material, including those deposited in connection with claims that have been refused registration, are the property of the U.S. government. Will my deposit be damaged by security measures in place on Capitol Hill? To avoid damage to your deposit caused by necessary security measures, package the following items in boxes rather than envelopes for mailing to the Copyright Office:    • electronic media such as audiocassettes, videocassettes, CDs, and DVDs    • microform    • photographs    • slick advertisements, color photocopies, and other print items that are rubber-and vegetable-based May I register more than one work on the same application? Where do I list the titles? You may register unpublished works as a collection on one application with one title for the entire collection if certain conditions are met. It is not necessary to list the individual titles in your collection, although you may by completing a Form CON. Published works may only be registered as a collection if they were actually first published as a collection and if other requirements have been met. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section &#8220;Registration Procedures.&#8221; Do I have to use my real name on the form? Can I use a stage name or a pen name? There is no legal requirement that the author be identified by his or her real name on the application form. For further information, see FL 101, Pseudonyms. If filing under a fictitious name, check the &#8220;Pseudonymous&#8221; box at space 2. How long does the registration process take? The time the Copyright Office requires to process an application varies, depending on the amount of material the Office is receiving. If your submission is in order, you may generally expect to receive a certificate of registration within approximately 4 to 5 months of submission. Please note that our mail service is severely disrupted.(Read more details.) Can I submit my manuscript on a computer disk? No. Floppy disks and other removal media such as Zip disks, except for CD-ROMs are not acceptable. Therefore, the Copyright Office still generally requires a printed copy or audio recording of the work for deposit. Can I submit a CD-ROM of my work? Yes. The deposit requirement consists of the best edition of the CD-ROM package of any work, including the accompanying operating software, instruction manual, and a printed version, if included in the package. Does my work have to be published to be protected? Publication is not necessary for copyright protection. How much do I have to change in my own work to make a new claim of copyright? You may make a new claim in your work if the changes are substantial and creative, something more than just editorial changes or minor changes. This would qualify as a new derivative work. For instance, simply making spelling corrections throughout a work does not warrant a new registration, but adding an additional chapter would. See Circular 14, Copyright Registration for Derivative Works, for further information. Do you have special mailing requirements? Our only requirement is that all three elements&#8212;the application, the copy or copies of the work, and the $30 filing fee&#8212;be sent in the same package. Many people send their material to us by certified mail, with a return receipt request, but this is not required. Please note that our mail service is severely disrupted. (Read more details.)
