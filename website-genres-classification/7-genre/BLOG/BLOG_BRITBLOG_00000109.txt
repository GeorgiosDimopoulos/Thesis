PHP nuke site update 
Ok the new site I made has been down for ages now. There are loads of possible reasons including tropical storms, hurricane frances etc. So the new server is going to be located in New York. I will have more diskspace and hopefully a better server. The server will be up in "72 hours" now. Grrrrrrr it keeps on changing and annoying me.I now own chiraag.co.uk. It costs Â£2.59 for 2 years. Everyone should get a domain, soon people will be able to have yourname@chiraag.co.uk. I am going to work so hard on the new site to get it where it was before, I am not sure if I have backups.

Im back.... 
Ok everyone as my normal site www.chiraag.co.nr is down, I thought I would tell you that it is the old Ps2 Superhouse and this stupid blog put together. This way it makes life easier, plus more people can help out. Please join it and then you can post in the forums.I found out the reason it was down, I did a tracert on www.stuckforhosting.co.uk but got a "unable to resolve system name" error, so Noel told me the IP, I then did a IP to country and found out that the datacentre was in North Carolina, and took a map view of it. Noel then looked for the weather in North Carolina and we found out there were heavy tropical storms! What are the odds of this!Man Utd were awful today, They managed to just scrape a draw against Blackburn. I am disgusted.Anyway now that the navbar is gone again I will post here when my normal site (www.chiraag.co.nr) is down.
