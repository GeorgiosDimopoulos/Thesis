 While in Kiev recently, I ate what I think were "blinis." They were crepe-like pancakes filled with cheese and folded into small squares. They were delicious! Does anyone have a traditional Ukrainian recipe for this dish that they would be willing to share?

 Pryvit! If you liked the Russian blini, why not try the Ukrainian "nalysnyky" which is similar in taste, if not in form. Blini are considered more traditional to the Russian table. Here is my Babusia's recipe: 

NALYSNYKY 

Serves 6 people or 4 Ukrainians 

What you need: 2 eggs~ 1/2 cup of milk~3 tablespoons water~1/2 cup white flour~1/4 teaspoon salt. 

What you do: Beat the eggs until light. Add the milk, water and remaining ingredients and beat until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Heat a small frying pan, about 6 inches across, over medium heat. Butter it lightly and then pour in about 3 or 4 tablespoons of the batter, just enough to coat the bottom in a single layer. Cook the pancake, watching to see that the bottom becomes a light brown and the top is firm to the touch. Remove from the pan, transfer to a warm plate and continue until all the batter is used, buttering the pan lightly before each one. 

For the filling: 2 cups of cottage cheese~2 egg yolks~2 tablespoons cream~salt~powdered sugar to taste. 

Press the cheese through a fine wire sieve to make a smooth paste. Be sure to use powdered sugar since granulated or coarse sugar will make for a grainy filling. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well. 

To make the nalysnyky: Spread a few spoonfuls of the cheese filling on the pancake and roll up to form a cylinder. Place the rolls in a buttered baking dish seam side down, dot with butter, cover tightly and bake in a moderate oven (about 350 degrees F) until heated through. 

Na zdorovia! Njam njam!

 Thanks marvalit and JP! I appreciate your replies. The recipte you provided JP sounds very much like what I ate while I was in Ukraine. I'll have to try making the recipe and see if it's the same. Again, spaseeba to both of you!

 Posting my recipe for Blini or Blintsi 

UNCLE BILL'S BLINTSI 
Serves 12 

3 cups homogenized whole milk 
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
1 tsp. salt 
3 large eggs 
2 Tbsp. granulated sugar 
1/2 tsp. baking soda 
3 Tbsp. butter, melted 
3 tsp. baking powder 
cooking oil for frying 
1/2 cup butter, melted for rubbing blintsi 

In a large bowl, add milk. Add half a cup of flour at a time to the milk; beat well using an electric mixer after each addition of flour. 
Add salt and beat again. Add one egg at a time and beat well after each addition. 
Add sugar and beat again. 
Add 3 tablespoons of melted butter and baking soda and beat to blend well. 
Add baking powder and beat until incorporated. 
Let batter sit for about 5 minutes before using. Batter consistency should be like fresh whipping cream, quite thin so that if flows and spreads. 
Preheat griddle of frying pan to 425 - 450 F. Wipe griddle with cooking oil before cooking each blintsi. Pour about 1/2 cup of batter on griddle and quickly spread over griddle by shaking the griddle in a circular motion. Cook until edges start to curl slightly, flip over and cook an additional 10 seconds. Remove blintsi, fold in half and rub generously with melted butter. Serve immediately or place in a preheated 275 F oven until more are made. 
SERVING SUGGESTIONS: 
Use various jams or syrups for a topping. If desired, pour whipping cream over jam or syrups or spread with sour cream or yogurt along with jams of syrups. 
Also, serve them just with a sprinkling of lemon juice and confectioners' sugar. 
You may also place some blueberries or strawberries in the middle of the blintsi and then roll them up. Cottage cheese is another good filling.
