Subject: A3) What is a super-typhoon? What is a major hurricane ? What is an intense hurricane ? 
"Super-typhoon" is a term utilized by the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center for typhoons that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds of at least 65 m/s (130 kt, 150 mph). This is the equivalent of a strong Saffir-Simpson category 4 or category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin or a category 5 severe tropical cyclone in the Australian basin. 
"Major hurricane" is a term utilized by the National Hurricane Center for hurricanes that reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds of at least 50 m/s (96 kt, 111 mph). This is the equivalent of category 3, 4 and 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The term "intense hurricane" is unofficial, but is often used in the scientific literature. It is the same as "major hurricane". Back to Basic Definitions Page | Back to Main FAQ Page
