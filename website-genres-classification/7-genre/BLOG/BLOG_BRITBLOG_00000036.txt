Weddings can be expensive if you want them to be. However, there are many cost-cutting ideas that would allow you keep some money aside for a romantic honeymoon or a down payment on your new house. With a little imagination and some help from family and friends you can have a luxurious wedding for much fewer dollars. posted by Weight at 4:36 AM 0 comments

You don't need to invite every person you have met since high school. Instead of a three course meal, why not choose a hot and cold buffet. Instead of using an expensive hotel suite for the reception, why not consider having it at someone's home, private club or even book a restaurant. Keep an open bar to a minimum. posted by Weight at 3:34 AM 0 comments

Determining when you get married can actually affect your wedding budget. According to TheKnot.com, June, August and September are the most popular months for marriages. The more popular your wedding month, the less choice you'll have about the site, cake makers, flowers, photographers, etc. The most popular day of the week is Saturday, so you can save money by having your nuptials on Friday night or a Sunday. posted by Weight at 1:28 AM 0 comments

First, talk to your partner about expectations. How do you see the wedding? Do you want a formal wedding in a grand cathedral or something more casual? Will it be a large wedding or a small, intimate ceremony with family and a few friends? Indoor ceremony or outdoors? Next, begin to budget for the items the two of you have agreed upon. posted by Weight at 12:25 AM 0 comments
