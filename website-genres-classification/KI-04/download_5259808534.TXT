You only need to download one of the clients above. 

What are the different types of clients? The Consoles run in the background and are launched from a terminal, to which they output text messages about the simulation's progress. The Graphical client runs in the background and has a graphics window available that allows you to see the protein being simulated. The screensaver runs just like any other screensaver, except that it also runs our calculation in the background. 

How do I choose a username? To check to see if a name is already being used, you can do a stats seach below. You can choose any user name you like, as long as it contains only letters or numbers (to insert a space, you can use the underscore "_" character). If you choose your email as your username, we will NOT print your full email anywhere. Instead, just the part before the @ sign will be used in any stats listing, etc. 

Type your name above (where it says "YourName") to see if the name you've chosen is already being used. You can also choose not to have a username and just donate your CPU time anonymously. 

Beta clients: If you would like to help test our forthcoming clients, visit our beta section to see if there are any beta clients available for your platform and what their new features are.
