Kathy's Fort Knox
=====================================================================
 
I display this ribbon in honor of the victims and their families affected by the horrible and tragic event that occured on September 11, 2001.    I thank all of the courageous men and women who were involved in the rescue efforts. My prayers to all for the strength to endure such sadness.	 	
Thank you for visiting Kathy's Fort Knox. I was born in Connecticut and have lived here all my life. My home is in a small rural town surrounded by the many wonders of nature. The term "TGIF" is familiar to many of you out there who experience a challenging work week. I have found that our home's private location allows us to escape from all of those outside stresses and into a world of relaxation. A world of total bliss with the peace and quiet of our surroundings.
My husband and I  have two very  handsome boys  who are both working hard and living on their own. My oldest son completed his college studies and is doing very well. He is engaged to a wonderful person who has a delightful little boy. Together they purchased a home not far from our home. My youngest son lives in Boston and is following his deams and his musical interests. He would like to become an electrician and is presently an apprentice with an electrical company in Boston. I have learned that it is hard to let go, but it is very rewarding to see your children sprout wings in a successful flight. I am so proud of both of them... <smiling>
A tribute to my shadow, my Sasha, who is sadly missed.
What my family did for me.
 We're having a baby! :::hehehe::: 
I am a secretary at an Elementary School that includes 4th and 5th graders. I love my job, all of the staff and also enjoy the students so much at this grade level. Learning to create custom reports at my previous job was very interesting and made me realize how "literal" the computer is when writing commands. It DOES NOT know that you *meant* to tell it to do something different than what you entered as the commands. <snickering>   I have to say that I am a very serious    person and *always* handle myself in a professional manner. Honestly, I do!   Oh! I almost forgot! If you are 18 years of age or older, you can view some pretty kewl photos of me. <grinning>   Just remember, you have to be of age or you will not be able to view them. 
My interests are Genealogy and Computers. There is one thing that computers and motherhood have in common . . .multitasking. . . and I had that skill down to a science years ago when my children were younger. <grin> My mother had 12 sisters and brothers in her family so keeping up with the family roots has been challenging as well as enjoyable. This is where my computer comes in... It has made it easier for me to keep track of my family. Especially since I have 50 first cousins and an ever increasing number of 70+ second cousins. I bought my first computer in December 1993 which is when I first began to explore the online services. I have met so many wonderful people and have gained some *special* friendships along the way. This has been a fantastic learning experience for me! I still have a *lot* to learn and look forward to keeping up with all that is available to me using the computer technology.
A smile goes a long way...
See what I mean?
<smiling back at you>
