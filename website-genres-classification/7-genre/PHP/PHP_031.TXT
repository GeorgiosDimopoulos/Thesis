Hi! I'm Wendy Hines. I am an assistant professor of mathematics at UNL. I began
here in Fall 1993. Before that, I received my PhD from Georgia Tech.
 
Research
My research is in the area of dynamical systems. Currently I am working on
discretized delay equations and continuity of attractors and Morse sets with
respect to the disctretization timestep. This work is in my paper with Tomas
Gedeon entitled Continuity of Morse Sets With Respect to the Discretization
Parameter.
 
Summer Camp
This summer I am teaching a summer math camp for high school girls. 
I'm teaching a course on Iterations of Functions. Soon we will be doing
stairstep diagrams to graphically show the orbit of an iterated function.
Here's an example.
 
We will also be doing bifurcation diagrams. Here's the bifurcation diagram for
the logistic equation.
 
You can find the notes for this in Iterations. 
 
It's a great experience! It is not very often that a teacher gets to teach 14 students who really 
want to learn!
