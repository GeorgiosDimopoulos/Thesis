Frequently asked questions about breaking into pharmaceutical sales
The answers provided in this section are generalities for pharmaceutical sales and do not always (but do typically) hold true.
* No sales experience
 
Q	 I do not have sales experience. Is there any chance of breaking into pharmaceutical sales without first gaining this experience?	 
A	 Yes, it's possible. No, it's not highly likely. Some pharmaceutical companies hire new college graduates or candidates that have experience in the medical or related field, but no sales experience. If you do not have successful sales experience, your chances of breaking into pharmaceutical sales are more limited, but it is still possible. You will have to put some extra effort into showing your initiative and preparing for your pharmaceutical sales interviews.  	 
* Too much experience/age
 
Q	 I have been in the work force for 15 years <post-graduate>. I hear it is harder to get into pharmaceutical sales after you've hit a certain age. Is that true?	 
A	 Unfortunately, that does tend to be true. Although age discrimination is illegal, the pharmaceutical industry is certainly kinder to younger candidates (generally speaking). Part of the thinking behind this is that once you've reach a certain point in your life (or career), you are less likely to be able to put up with the various egos involved in calling on physicians. If you are over 35 your chances of breaking in are certainly lower (in most cases).  	 
* Out of work
 
Q	 I was downsized this month and I am committed to breaking into pharmaceutical sales. Will I have more difficulty getting an interview without having a job?	 
A	 Some pharmaceutical companies &/or managers are not interested in potential employees unless they are employed. Given the current state of the economy, there may be a little more flexibility and understanding in the market. It takes an average of 4 to 6 months to break into pharmaceutical sales, so if you are unemployed you should be aware that you may have a bit of a wait ahead of you. Also, take note that the longer you have been unemployed, the more difficult it will be to get an interview.  	 
* Recent college graduate
 
Q	 I just graduated from college. Do pharmaceutical companies hire people like me, with no related experience?	 
A	 Some pharmaceutical companies will hire college graduates with no sales experience. If you have a record of solid achievement, your odds will be much greater. *Take a look at a periodical provided by NACE (National Association of Colleges & Employers) to find out which pharmaceutical companies are targeting new graduates (check with your local library).  	 
* Job hopping/tech industry 
Q	 Because I have been in sales in the technical industry, my resume shows a very broken work history. Will this hurt my chances of getting into pharmaceutical sales?	 
A	 There are pharmaceutical companies who have strict requirements regarding "job hopping" (regardless of the reason). One company refuses to interview anyone who has had more than 1 job since college graduation (that gets trickier the longer you're out of college!). If you have had 4 jobs in the past 5 years (for example), you will have more difficulty getting an initial interview (order the BOOK or sign up for a Tele-Class for more NETWORKING tips).  	 
* Driving record
 
Q	 My driving record is slightly less than perfect. How clean does your driving record need to be for pharmaceutical sales?	 
A	 This question comes up a lot. If you have been convicted of a dui/dwi (driving while intoxicated) in the past 3-5 years, your chances are close to zero. Different pharmaceutical companies have different policies. If you have 3 or more traffic violations within the past 3 years, you will have great difficulty. If you get to a second or final round interview with a company, and you are in question about your driving record, call the company's HR department (anonymously) and ask if they can tell you what their policy is (you may not get an answer, but it won't hurt to try).
