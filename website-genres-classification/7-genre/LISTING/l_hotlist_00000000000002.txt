Hotlists, bookmarks and hot links
These are synonymns for a list of Internet sites. When you have a hotlist, you don't have to remember the URL for a Web page. Instead, you just click on a link and go right to the site. You can have a personal hotlist - sites you visit frequently - as well as hotlists on specific topics, like politics or music.
Web browsers let you build hotlists by "bookmarking" sites (as in Netscape) or designating "favorite" sites (Microsoft Internet Explorer and America Online's browser).

* CyberTimes Navigator - Web launchpad for NY Times reporters 
* FACSNET
