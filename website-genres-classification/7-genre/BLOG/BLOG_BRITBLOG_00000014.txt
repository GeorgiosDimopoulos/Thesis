Where did it go?  
Being an active supporter of the concept of the European Union, I was shocked (almost!) to find that the “clear, informative and far-reaching, the Eurostat yearbook 2004” which “serves as a practical statistical guide to the major issues relating to the evolution of the European Union” has just been published with a front cover map illustration which OMITS WALES from the map! How ever did they manage to actually remove a whole country from a map on the cover of the publication that is regarded as the fact source for the whole of the EU? Amazing! It isn’t as though Wales is a minute little island some way off the coast of England. It is a country – about the same size as, say, Massachusetts. This is using the American method of relative size, of course, where England is about the size of Alabama and Scotland is about the size of South Carolina. I have wandered off the point again here, haven’t I. Maybe it is the still strong holiday spirit in me, but I’ve always enjoyed observing the way in which Americans try to understand how big another country is – by comparing it to one of their own States. For example, Italy is “slightly larger than Arizona”, France is “slightly less than twice the size of Colorado” and Germany is “slightly smaller than Montana”. I’m glad we got that cleared up. At least, we in Europe have actually heard of those US States – which is more than can be said for a great many US citizens, unfortunately.
Still, what of the vanishing country of Wales though? Looking at the illustration, it would seem that the vanishing act happened in the studio of the book publisher, not in the Irish sea at all. But, how did it vanish so easily? Doesn’t the publication dept of Eurostat have any checking systems built into the proofing stage of any of it’s publications? It is even more bizarre when one knows that the offices for Eurostat in the UK are in – wait for it - WALES! Yes, they even managed to delete their own UK office from the map at the same time. 
Perhaps the question that has to be asked now is, is the rest of the information contained in the book of similar authenticity? What else has been left out – or simply wrong – in the publication? And, more importantly, does anyone actually care about it?

Back again.  
With apologies for having taken so much 'time off' from the blog. It was a great holiday though - I will post a few piccies a little later for you to get a small taste of what - and where - we did and went. If you are thinking about taking a holiday in Italy - don't hesitate any longer. Just do it! I will try to get normal postings going very soon again. Thanks for the messages of interest and support though. They are much appreciated.

Big Brother Award  
The 6th Annual Big Brother Award winners have just been announced by Privacy International, which were 'presented' as a special ceremony at the London School of Economics (LSE) on the 28th July. This sounds like the television 'reality' series, Big Brother, known and apparently loved by millions of bored Brits - to say nothing of the many other national flavours of Big Brother around the world. THIS Big Brother is more in the spirit of the Orwell classic, 1984, however.From a motley selection of intrusive people and organisations, the shortlist included such erswhile people as The Rt Hon Margaret Hodge MP, jointly with Katherine Courtney and The Rt Hon Charles Clarke MP. Organisations shortlisted included Lloyds TSB plc, FollowUS, British Gas plc, Vodaphone plc, National Health Service (NHS), Department of Transport (DOT), Office of National Statistics, US Department of Commerce and the US VISIT programme. An interesting collection of intruders into personal privacy - it almost seems a shame that winners had to be chosen.

Holiday Time is nearly here.  
It is holiday time here in Italy, which as many of you will already know, closes for August (well, almost!) Along with everyone else, I will be vanishing into the sunset next week for a few weeks of relaxing, sitting back and enjoying the wonders and beauty of Italy. No - no trip to Barbados for us this year! I thought that you might enjoy a very quick tour of the Italy that we will be driving, slowly, through on our way to Puglia (Apulia if you are English) and the wonderful shores and beaches there.Our first port of call will be Bologna,heading towards Firenze (Florence to the Brits),then on to the towered town of San Gimignano where we will stay for a couple of days.Next stop will be Sienabefore heading for Perugiaand then Assisi, where we will stay for another couple of days.The next leg will be toward Terni,follwed by Rieti, the apparent centre of Italy (so they claim)followed by Avezzano,on our way to Sulmona, where we will spend another couple of days.The last leg will be heading toward Beneventoand then to Matera, where the famous Sassi are,ending the long drive in Puglia,where we will spend the next couple of weeks lying on beaches, visiting restaurants, trulli, grottos and castles, before lying on the beaches again. Isn't Italy a wonderful place!
Cin, cin!
