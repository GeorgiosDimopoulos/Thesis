Welcome to Matt's Homepage
I realize this page is pretty dull, but it serves its purpose. 
I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, in the Department of Mathematics. I'm studying algebraic coding theory, particularly the theory of low density parity check (LDPC) codes. "What's that?" you ask. Email me and ask if you're curious.
Project Fulcrum - I spent the 2001-2002 school year at Everett Elementary School here in Lincoln working with 4th- and 5th-grade students in math and science. It was an incredible experience. Please check out their website.
Click here for some math-related links. 
I've put together a very short list of my favorite links. It's still growing. Slowly. 
Gary's teaching 5 classes! So now I'm handling the web site for the Black Rock Fantasy Hockey League.
