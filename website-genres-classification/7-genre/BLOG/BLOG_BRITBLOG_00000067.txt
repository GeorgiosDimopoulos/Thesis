 BlogThis!  One Teaspoon or Two?  
This blog will not be supersized. It will not sound better on XM Satellite radio. It will not look better in pink. It will not stay in Vegas even if it is happens in Vegas. It will not make you a Survivor or an Apprentice or even a Big Brother. In fact it will not do anything.

Your search ends hereMy blog is slipping in the search results on GoogleSo I have to make some efforts to doodleDoodle's the best I could doBecause few words rhyme with this competitor of YahooSo in here I shall put some terms people searchThings like "killings in a Milwaukee church"Also thrown in for good measureAre terms like "File Taxes without pressure"If tabloid stories be your cup of teaYou might like "Michael Jackson enters guilty plea"Before you move away from this page in disgustRemember the last term you searched was "For J Lo I lust"Now before you judge me as being too shallowRememeber to cast a stone only if you aren't hollowLiterary value of this poem is pretty much nilBut you could end up here if you looked for "Things to do in Nashville"Since all said and doneIsn't this all about being number one? posted by Avinash Modi at 9:53 AM 0 comments

You know what I am saying?If you think 50 Cent is something you can buy a can of cola with...If you think Usher is the guy who points you to your seats in the movie theatre...If you think Snoop Dogg is a comic character...If you still refer to P Diddy as Puff Daddy...Then this site should help you blend in and seem like one of the homies. posted by Avinash Modi at 2:06 AM 2 comments

'Holi'day SpiritsI am not a great believer in the holiday spirit. To me a holiday is a holiday. I dont care if it is President's Day or National Pickle Day. It is not an occasion for me to renew my faith or celebrate the accomplishments of people or mourn history's mistakes. A holiday to me means no work. It means a glorious opportunity to catch up on sleep, television reruns and personal hygiene. However, every now and then I get a heartwarming link in an email originally sent out by TP Ganesh to half the workforce in Infosys Pune which gives me the holiday spirits and so I shall spread it to you as well, priceless moments of President Bush singing "Balle Balle! Holi Hai" posted by Avinash Modi at 10:43 PM 0 comments

The cover of 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince' was unveiled today. They are now going to have three different cover designs, the US version, the UK version and the UK Adult version. Click here for the pics. Soon you will be seeing pictures of the illustrators popping up at various quizzes and quiz masters daring you to identify them. I am not going to make your job easy. Go find the pictures for yourself. posted by Avinash Modi at 2:28 PM 3 comments

About Me
Name:Avinash Modi 
Location:The Woodlands, Texas, United States 
I was known by several different names in the past. Some sneered and asked me "Why I write what I write?" while others pestered me with grammatically incorrect questions like "Why the chicken really crossed the road?" Enough said.
