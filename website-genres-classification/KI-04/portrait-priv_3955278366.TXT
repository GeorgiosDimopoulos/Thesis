Sven Neuhaus' personal homepage

Welcome to Yet Another Homepage.  

I have maintained this homepage since 1994. It now uses strict  HTML 4.01 so use a  standards  conforming browser for the "best value". It should be readable  with any browser, however.
 Since you came here, you're probably looking for information about me.  So here it goes... 

Work

* Job.  
I work at Heise Zeitschriften  Verlag doing web software development and network administration.  
* Studies.  
 I'm a computer science student at the  University of Dortmund after  graduating from Canfield  High School in 1990 and Leibniz  Gymnasium Dortmund in 1992.  

Hobbies

* Computers & Internet.  
PING e.V. is Germany's  largest non-commercial club that provides cheap internet access to  private individuals in  the Dortmund area. My involvement  with PING reaches back to its beginnings in 1992. I was on PINGs  managing comittee a few times.
 I like to hack on my Linux  box at home (perl  rules). I also have a  S/// P800 that I mess around with.  
* Computer games.  
Fortunately, I got to do for a living what I love to  do in my spare time: Multiplayer online games. My all time favourite:  Netrek. Another excellent one is  Empire. I'm currently playing  Battlefield 1942  and  Dark Age of Camelot on the Andred PvP server.  My favourite single-player game of all times must be    Elite. I'm still  waiting for a massive multiplayer online version to appear. Meanwhile,  Christian Pinder has used the original BBC sources for an excellent  new version.  
* Movies.  
The  University Film Club  shows movies every week during terms. I used to be an active member, now the lack of time is taking its toll.  
* Sports.  
I like scuba diving,  Basketball, Badminton, windsurfing and snowboarding among others.  I recently started playing golf.  
* Travel.  
I love traveling. Comes handy when you want to go diving  in warm water :-)  

People

* Bettina,  my girlfriend.  
She's a babe.  
* Michael,  
All around nice guy and total UNIX guru. His web page is a bit  lacking at the moment...  
*  Dirk,  
(former) Netrek geek, perl  hacker, bigmouth (in the nicest possible way :-).  
*  Rudolf, big brother.  
avid surfer, hobbyist cook, wine and jazz fan.  
* Frosch,  
hardware wiz, game maniac, former roommate, Windows NT borg.  
* [MaTT], 
* Chmul, 
* I'm trying to find people who spend 1989/1990 in Ohio, USA as Rotary exchange students and attended the Ohio-Erie Rotary bus tour 1990 (big picture). Contact me! 
* And many more w/out homepages... 

Software

Stuff I've written that I think might be useful for others. 

* DAoC Realm Abilities Configurator  
JavaScript application for players of Mythic's Dark Age of  Camelot.  
* Notify  
Notify your website's visitors of changes to your pages.  
* Heise Compressor  
Read the latest (german) Heise  News, all on one page. Nice for mobile browsing.

A must read.  

Contact

* EMail  
My email address is <&#115;&#118;&#101;&#110;@&#112;&#105;&#110;&#103;.&#100;&#101;>.  I dislike unsolicited commercial email (UCE, aka spam). Do you?  Try TMDA.  
* Privacy  
Use my public key  (GPG)  to encrypt your email. It's also on the  public key servers.
