In his answer to the socialist group open letter to Lamy on the
paragraph 6 of the Doha declaration and the possibility of using
exceptions under article 30, Mr. Lamy refers to the fact that
exceptions under art 30 "would be very complicated from a technical
legal point of view". Abstract from the letter pasted here under.
"questions about the legal merits" of the article 30 options are also
referred to in the proposal made by the Commission to the member
states in the Committee 133.

Meanwhile,
the ITRE Committee (industry and external trade) in the EU Parliament
(EP) has requested the legal services of the EP to give its opinion on
the "legal obstacles" that are being referred to exceptions under
article 30 and has request a summary of the legal arguments that could
be used in arguing for the legal feasibility of the art 30 solution.

----------------------------------------------------
Abstract of Lamy's answer to the PES group letter:

"The article 30 solution may, at first glance, seem tempting, because
it does not require a formal amendment TRIPs Agreement. However, it
would raise some serious problems. Firstly, it would be very
complicated from a legal-technical point of view. Secondly, it has met
fierce resistance  with most industrialised countries, who are
concerned about the open-ended nature of such an interpretation. It
may therefore be extremely difficult and take longer before we could
agree on such a solution, if ever.

An amendment of article 31 may be easier to achieve, despite the fact
that we would have to go through a formal amendment procedure. It
would set up a clear ground, in the TRIPs Agreement itself, to export
to a country without manufacturing capacities. Moreover, it would
apply to exports to countries with or without patents alike. Article
31(f) allows for exports under a compulsory license without
distinction of the patent status of the product concerned in the
countries of destination"
