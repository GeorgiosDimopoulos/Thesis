13.1 Aliens and U.S. Citizens Living Abroad: Canadian & U.S. Tax Issues
I am a U.S. citizen. If I move to Canada to live and work there as a Canadian permanent resident, do I pay both U.S. and Canadian Taxes?
United States citizens living abroad are required to file annual U.S. income tax returns and report their worldwide income if they meet the minimum income filing requirements for their filing status and age. You must contact the Canadian Government to determine whether you must file a Canadian tax return and pay Canadian taxes. For the United States income tax return, you will have several options available to you regarding claiming a foreign tax credit or excluding some or all of your foreign earned income.

I am a Canadian citizen living and working in the U.S. for a U.S. employer on a visa. Do I need to file both a U.S. tax return and a Canadian tax return?
You must comply with both U.S. and Canadian filing requirements. In the United States, you generally are required to file a return if you have income from the performance of personal services within the United States. However, under certain circumstances, that income may be exempt from payment of U.S. tax pursuant to the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty. You need to determine what type of visa you have, and how that impacts your residency status in the United States. If, based on the tax code and your visa status you are treated as a U.S. resident, then your entitlement to treaty benefits will be impacted.

I am a Canadian citizen who worked in the U.S. for 4 months. Do I have to file a U.S. income tax return as well as my income tax return in Canada?
In the United States, you generally are required to file a return if you have income from the performance of personal services within the US. The type of return to file would depend upon whether you are a resident of the U.S. for purposes of U.S. tax law. There are several tests to determine residency, including the substantial presence test, which is based on how many days you are present in the U.S. over a period of three years. Refer to Tax Topic 851 for information about which return to file. If you are simultaneously a U.S. resident under U.S. law and a Canadian resident under Canadian law, you should consult the U.S.-Canada income tax treaty for rules that would treat you as a resident of only one country. It is also possible that you may have to file a dual-status return in the U.S. if you qualify as a U.S. resident for only part of the year. Refer to Tax Topic 852 for dual-status information.

Are the Canada Pension Plan and Canadian Old Age Security Benefits taxable? If they are, please tell me where they should be entered on Form 1040.
Benefits paid under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Quebec Pension Plan (QPP), and Old Age Security (OAS) program to a U.S. resident are taxable, if at all, only in the United States. According to the U.S. - Canada income tax treaty, taxation of these benefits is based on residence. U.S. citizens or green card holders who reside in Canada are not subject to U.S. tax on this income. 
These Canadian benefits are treated as U.S. social security benefits for U.S. tax purposes. Thus, under section 86 of the Internal Revenue Code, the portion of the benefits that is taxable will depend on your income and filing status. If your modified adjusted gross income is above certain limits, a maximum of 85% of your benefits will be subject to U.S. tax. Refer to Tax Topic 423 for information about determining the taxable amount of your benefits. Any benefit under the social security legislation of Canada that would not be subject to Canadian tax if paid to a resident of Canada is not subject to U.S. tax. 
Canadian benefits that are treated as U.S. social security benefits are reported on line 20a and 20b of Form 1040, U. S. Individual Income Tax Return or line 14a and 14b of Form 1040A.

I am a U.S. citizen who lived in Canada and invested in Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) which are similar to IRAs. Under the Canada - U.S. Tax Treaty, I am not sure how to treat the income on these investments. Is the income tax deferred or must it be claimed as earned?
Although Canadian registered retirement savings plans are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs), they do not meet the requirements for qualification as IRAs under section 408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, the earnings of such a plan are includable currently in the gross income of the beneficiary of the plan for United States income tax purposes. Whether or not the earnings are distributed. However, a beneficiary of certain Canadian retirement plans may elect for a tax year (the current year) to defer United States income tax on certain current-year earnings of the plan that are not distributed to the beneficiary. An election to defer is made by the beneficiary attaching to the beneficiary's United States federal income tax return, a statement that contains for each plan the information specified in Revenue Procedure 2002-23 , 2002-15 I.R.B. 744, or in any future Revenue Procedure that supersedes Rev. Proc. 2002-23. Additional filing requirements are detailed in Notice 2003-25, 2003-18 I.R.B. 855 and Notice 2003-57, 2003-34 I.R.B. 397.

I need to convert Canadian currency to U.S. dollars. How does the foreign currency exchange rate work?
Foreign currency needs to be translated into U.S. dollars to determine the amount of income (such as income from the sale of goods or services, dividends or interest) to report on a taxpayer's U.S. return and to determine gain or loss when foreign currency is disposed of. The proper translation rate depends on the item of income and whether the taxpayer is a cash or accrual method taxpayer. 
. Dividends . Dividends are translated at the spot rate on the date received. 
. Interest . Interest income that is not required to be accrued (because, for example, the taxpayer is an individual holding a debt instrument that does not have original issue discount) is translated at the spot rate on the date received. Interest income that is required to be accrued is translated at the average rate for each accrual period. When such interest is received the taxpayer will realize foreign currency gain or loss based on the difference in exchange rates used to accrue the interest and the spot rate on the date such interest is received. (A taxpayer may also realize foreign currency gain or loss on the principal when the instrument is sold or matures.) 
. Payable and receivables . An accrual basis taxpayer may also realize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to a foreign currency denominated payable or receivable. Generally, foreign currency gain or loss is computed by reference to the change in exchange rates between the time the payable or receivable arises and when it is paid or received. For example, if an accrual basis taxpayer sells a product for L100 when L1= $1 with payment to occur in 90 days and receives payment of L100 when L1 = $1.20, the taxpayer will realize $20 ($120 - $100) of foreign currency gain. It should be noted that in certain circumstances, taxpayers may use spot rate conventions if consistent with the taxpayer method of financial accounting. 
You can generally get the exchange rates from banks and U.S. Embassies. Other possible sources of exchange rate would be publications, such as the Wall Street Journal. If there is more than one exchange rate, use the one that most properly reflects your income.

I won money at a Las Vegas casino and my winnings were subject to a 30% withholding tax. I am a Canadian citizen. How can I get the withholding tax back?
Generally, you must file a tax return after the end of the tax year to claim a refund of withholding. Gambling winnings by nonresidents of the U.S. are generally taxed at a flat 30% tax rate. However, under the U.S./Canada Tax Treaty, residents of Canada may claim gambling losses, but only to the extent of gambling winnings. You should report both your total gambling winnings and your total gambling losses on page 4 of Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, on the dotted portion of line 83. If you have net gambling winnings (after offsetting your total losses against your total winnings), you should include this net amount on line 83, column (d) of the Form 1040NR. You should also attach a copy of the Form 1042-S, Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding, showing the taxes withheld to your Form 1040NR. 
A diary of your losses should be kept for your records.
To file a Form 1040NR you must have a valid identification number. Refer to Tax Topic 857 if you have not already been issued one.

13.3 Aliens and U.S. Citizens Living Abroad: Foreign Income & Foreign Income Exclusion
What is foreign earned income? Is it income from a foreign source or income paid by a U.S. company while living abroad?
Earned income is pay for personal services performed, such as wages, salaries, or professional fees. Foreign earned income is income you receive for services you perform in a foreign country during a period when your tax home is in a foreign country and during which you meet either the bona fide residence test or the physical presence test. It does not matter whether earned income is paid by a U.S. employer or a foreign employer. Foreign earned income does not include the following amounts. 
* The previously excluded value of meals and lodging furnished for the convenience of your employer. 
* Pension or annuity payments including social security benefits. 
* Payments by the U.S. Government, or any U.S. government agency or instrumentality, to its employees. 
* Amounts included in your income because of your employer's contributions to a nonexempt employee trust or to a nonqualifying annuity contract. 
* Recaptured unallowable moving expenses 
* Payments received after the end of the tax year following the tax year in which you performed the services that earned the income.

I have a bank account in a foreign country. Do I have to report the interest?
If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien with investment income from sources outside the United States (foreign income), you must report all that income on your tax return unless it is exempt by U.S. law. This is true whether you reside inside or outside the United States and whether or not you receive a Form 1099 or similar statement from the foreign payer. 
You will report the income on Form 1040, Schedule B (PDF), Interest & Dividend Income. You may be required to Check the box "yes" on the bottom of Schedule B if you have a foreign bank account.

Do I have to meet the 330-day presence test or have a valid working resident visa to meet the requirement for foreign income exclusion?
To claim the foreign earned income exclusion, the foreign housing exclusion, or the foreign housing deduction, you must have foreign earned income, your tax home must be in a foreign country, and you must be one of the following: 
* A U.S. citizen who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year, 
* A U.S. resident alien who is a citizen or national of a country with which the United States has an income tax treaty with a nondiscrimination article in effect and who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year, or 
* A U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident alien who is physically present in a foreign country or countries for at least 330 full days during any period of 12 consecutive months. 
U.S. tax law does not specifically require a foreign resident visa or work visa for this purpose, but you (must/should) comply with the other country's laws.

I am a nonresident alien. Can I take the foreign earned income exclusion if I meet the bona fide resident test or physical presence test? If yes, what is the tax form used for nonresident taxpayer?
No, nonresident aliens do not qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion. Only if you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and live abroad, may you qualify to exclude up to $80,000 of your foreign earned income for 2003. But, if you are the nonresident alien spouse of a U.S. citizen or resident alien, you can elect to be treated as a U.S. resident in order to file a joint return. In this case, you can take the foreign earned income exclusion if otherwise qualified. Refer to Publication 519 , U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens , for detailed instructions on how to make this election. 
However, nonresident aliens would be able to exclude their foreign earned income under the dual-status rules. Refer to Tax Topic 852 for dual-status information. A nonresident alien is generally not subject to U.S. tax on compensation for services performed outside the U.S.

13.4 Aliens and U.S. Citizens Living Abroad: Nonresident Alien - General
I am a foreign national and came to this country on June 30th of last year. I have a H-1 visa. What is my tax status regarding residency nonresident alien, or resident alien?
You were a dual status alien last year. As an H-1 visa holder in the U.S. for 183 days or more, you likely became a resident, for tax purposes, as of June 30th. For the part of the year you are a resident alien, you are taxed on income from all sources. 
For the part of the year that you are not a resident alien, you are not taxed on income from sources outside the United States, unless the income is effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States. 
Income from U.S. sources is taxable whether you receive it while a nonresident alien or a resident alien unless specifically exempt under the Internal Revenue Code or a tax treaty provision. Generally, tax treaty provisions apply only to the part of the year you were a nonresident and only if you are a resident for treaty purposes of a country that has a treaty with the United States. 
For that part of the year that you are a nonresident, file Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. For that part of the year you are a resident, file Form 1040 (PDF) . Refer to Tax Topic 852 for dual-status information.

I have an H-1 visa and my husband has an F-1 visa. We both lived in the United States all last year and had income. What kind of form should we file? Do we file our taxes separately or jointly?
You will have met the substantial presence test and will be taxed as a resident alien for last year, while your husband is likely to be a nonresident alien. Refer to Tax Topic 851 for an explanation of the relevant tax forms. You may file a joint tax return if your husband makes the choice to be treated as a resident for the entire year. Generally, however, you cannot claim tax treaty benefits as a resident alien. Please refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens , for detailed instructions on making this choice.

I was an international student (F-1 visa) until October 1, then my visa status was changed to H-1. Should I file my income tax return as a dual status or nonresident alien?

I am a nonresident alien with no dependents. I am working with my H-1 visa. Do I file a Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ?

You can use Form 1040NR-EZ instead of Form 1040NR if all nine of the following apply. 
* You do not claim any dependents. 
* You cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person's U.S. tax return (such as your parent's return). 
* Your only U.S. source income was from wages, salaries, tips, taxable refunds of state and local income taxes, and scholarship or fellowship grants. 
* Your taxable income (line 14 of Form 1040NR-EZ) is less than $50,000. 
* The only adjustments to income you can claim are the student loan interest deduction or scholarship and fellowship grants excluded. 
* You do not claim any tax credits. 
* If you were married, you do not claim an exemption for your spouse. 
* If you itemize deductions, the only deduction you claim is for state and local income taxes. 
* The only taxes you owe are the tax from the tax tables, the social security and Medicare tax on tip income not reported to your employer, and the household employment taxes.

I am a nonresident alien and invested money in U. S. stock market through a U.S. brokerage company. Are the dividends and the capital gains taxable? If yes, how are they taxed?
Generally, capital gains received by a nonresident alien not present in the United States for 183 days or more are not taxable in the United States. Certain gains, however, are subject to the 30% withholding rate or if applicable, a reduced tax treaty rate on the gross amount of the following items: 
1. Gains on disposal of timber, coal, or domestic iron ore with a retained economic interest, unless an election is made to treat those gains as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, 
2. Gains on contingent payments received from the sale or exchange after October 4, 1966, of patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, goodwill, trade marks, trade brands, franchises, and other sale property, 
3. Gains on certain transfers of all substantial rights to, or an undivided interest in, patents if the transfers were made before October 5, 1966, and 
4. Certain gains from the sale or exchange of original issue discount obligations issued after March 31, 1972. 
Dividends are withheld upon at the 30% or lower tax treaty rate. If your withholding is not at the correct rate, a nonresident alien should file Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return , to claim a refund of excess withheld taxes.

13.5 Aliens and U.S. Citizens Living Abroad: Nonresident Alien - Tax Withholding
I entered the U.S. in August and I have a J-2 visa with an Employment Authorization (work permit). Can I be considered as a U.S. resident for tax purposes under the substantial presence test? Since my visa does not allow me to stay in this country am I subjected to social security tax and Medicare tax?
You will be considered a U.S. resident for tax purposes if you meet the substantial presence test for the calendar year. As an exempt individual, a J-2 visa holder will not initially meet this test. 
For purposes of the substantial presence test, certain days of physical presence do not count, such as the days during which you were an exempt individual . Please refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens , for a detailed explanation of this issue. 
In general, U.S. social security and Medicare taxes apply to payments of wages for services performed as an employee in the United States, regardless of the citizenship or residence of either the employee or the employer. In limited situations, these taxes apply to wages for services performed outside the United States. This exception does not apply to a derivative visa holder.

I am a foreign citizen and resident from the European Union. I plan to buy U.S. stocks, but what tax will I have to pay if I have earnings on stocks?
U.S. source dividend income is subject to 30% tax rate when paid to nonresident aliens. A lower rate may apply to residents of a member country with which the United States has an income tax treaty. The U.S. does not currently recognize the E.U. as a taxing authority.

I am a nonresident alien. Our broker withholds 30% tax on dividends. Can I get this tax back since I already owe tax in my residence country on overseas income?
Generally, this type of income paid to nonresident aliens is taxable at the 30% or lower treaty rate. If your country has a tax treaty with the U.S., you may have a reduced rate of tax. If that is the case, you should file Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return, to claim a refund of federal income taxes withheld. To avoid future excess withholding, provide your broker with a completed Form W-8BEN (PDF) , Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for U.S. Tax Withholding. You may be entitled to a credit against the tax you owe to your residence country for the U.S. tax that is withhold from your dividends.

13.6 Aliens and U.S. Citizens Living Abroad: Nonresident Alien - Students
I am a foreign national and last year I changed my type of visa from F-1 student to H-1 work visa. Does my visa status change how I file my tax return or what forms I use?
It depends on whether or not you qualify as a resident alien. As a foreign national temporarily in the U.S. and now under an H-1 visa, you must file Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return and Form 8843 (PDF), Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition (if you do not meet the substantial presence test). In order to file a Form 1040, Individual Tax Return, you must meet the substantial presence test. Please refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens , for a detailed discussion of the Substantial Presence Test. You may also qualify to file as a dual status taxpayer for the year of your visa change. Refer toTax Topic 852 , for dual status information.

I am an F-1 student status who was employed during my school studies and directly afterwards I completed practical training. Do I have to pay FICA taxes? Which taxes should be taken out of my pay?
Generally, services performed by you as a nonresident alien temporarily in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F), (J), (M), or (Q) of section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act are not covered under the social security and medicare programs if the services are performed to carry out the purpose for which you were admitted to the United States. This means that there should be no withholding of social security or Medicare taxes from the pay you receive for these services. These types of services are very limited, and generally include only on-campus work, practical training, and economic hardship employment. However, you are covered under the social security and medicare programs for these services if you are considered a resident alien, even though your nonimmigrant classification ("F," "J," "M," or "Q") remains the same. Social security and Medicare taxes will be withheld from your pay. 
Additionally, any student who is enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school, college, or university may be exempt from social security and Medicare taxes on pay for services performed for such school, college, or university.

Are nonresident alien students, with F-1 or J-1 visas and employed by a U.S. company during the summer, required to have federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks?
The following discussion generally applies only to nonresident aliens. Wages and other compensation paid to a nonresident alien for services performed as an employee are usually subject to graduated withholding at the same rates as resident aliens and U.S. citizens. Therefore, your compensation, unless it is specifically excluded from the term "wages" by law, or is exempt from tax by treaty, is subject to graduated withholding. Nonresident aliens must follow modified instructions when completing Form W-4. Please refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens, for directions on completing Form W-4 (PDF), Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate .

13.7 Aliens and U.S. Citizens Living Abroad: U.S. Citizens Overseas
I am a U.S. citizen working abroad. Are my foreign earnings taxable?
A U.S. citizen or resident alien is generally subject to U.S. tax on total worldwide income. However, if you are a United States citizen or a resident alien who lives and works abroad, you may qualify to exclude all or part of your foreign earned income. For specific information, refer to Tax Topic 853, Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - General. 
If you would like more information on who qualifies for the exclusion, refer to Tax Topic 854, Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - who qualifies. For more information on what type of income qualifies for the exclusion, refer to Tax Topic 855, Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - what qualifies. You may also wish to refer to Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad, for a detailed discussion. 
If the information you need relating to this topic is not addressed in Publication 54, you may call the IRS International Tax Law hotline. The number is (215) 516-2000. This is not a toll-free number.

I live in a foreign country. Where can I find local tax assistance and forms?
The IRS has a full-time permanent staff in 6 U.S. Embassies. These offices have tax forms and publications, can help you with account problems, and answer your questions about notices and bills. For more information about these offices, please refer to www.irs.gov under "Contact My Local Office." 
In addition, most U.S. Embassies stock the more commonly used tax forms and publications, and sponsor speaking tours by IRS employees during filing season. 
I am a U.S. citizen and married a nonresident alien last year. At that time, we filed an application with the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS, formerly INS) for my spouse's adjustment of status. We plan to file married filing jointly. Will I need to use Form 1040NR?
As a U.S. citizen, you cannot file Form 1040NR (PDF), U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return. If you make an election to file a joint return with your nonresident alien spouse (your spouse must, in turn, elect to be taxed as U.S. resident), file Form 1040 (PDF), U.S. Individual Income Tax Return (or Form 1040A (PDF) or Form 1040EZ (PDF) if otherwise applicable), and report both incomes from worldwide sources. 
You will need to get an ITIN for your spouse. To apply for an ITIN, file Form W-7 (PDF), Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.

I worked out of the country for one year. Do I have to pay U.S. income tax?
As a U.S. citizen, your worldwide income generally is subject to U.S. income tax, regardless of where you are living. However, you may qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, foreign housing exclusion or foreign housing deduction, or the foreign tax credit. These tax benefits can reduce or eliminate the U.S. tax you would otherwise have to pay on your foreign income.

I am a U.S. citizen working for a U.S. firm in a foreign country. Is any part of my wages or expenses tax deductible?
U.S. citizens are taxed on their worldwide income, no matter where they work. Some taxpayers may qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion, foreign housing exclusion, or foreign housing deduction, if their tax home is in a foreign country and they were either a bona fide resident of a foreign country or countries for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year, or were physically present in a foreign country or countries for at least 330 full days during any period of 12 consecutive months. If the taxpayer is temporarily away from his or her tax home in the United States on business (less than a year), the taxpayer may qualify to deduct away from home expenses (for travel, meals, and lodging ) but would not qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion.

I am a U.S. citizen living and working overseas. Can I have a tax credit on my U.S. taxes for the taxes I pay to the foreign country?
The foreign tax credit is intended to relieve U.S. taxpayers of the double tax burden when their foreign source income is taxed by both the United States and the foreign country from which the income is derived. 
Generally, only income taxes paid or accrued to a foreign country or a U.S. possession qualify for the foreign tax credit. You can choose to take the amount of any qualified foreign taxes paid or accrued during the year as a foreign tax credit or as an itemized deduction. 
To choose the foreign tax credit you must generally complete Form 1116 (PDF), Foreign Tax Credit and attach it to your Form 1040. You may claim credit without attaching Form 1116 if all of your foreign source income is passive income (such as interest and dividends) reported to you on a payee statement and the total amount of qualifying foreign taxes you paid or accrued is not more than $300 ($600 in the case of a joint return) and is also reported to you on a payee statement. To choose the deduction, you must itemize deductions on Schedule A, Form 1040. 
You may not take either a credit or a deduction for taxes paid or accrued on income you exclude under the foreign earned income exclusion or the foreign housing exclusion. There is no double taxation in this situation because the income is not subject to U.S. tax.

How much money can I bring in to the U.S.?
There is no limit on the total amount of monetary instruments which may be brought into or taken out of the United States, nor is it illegal to do so. However, if you transport or cause to be transported (including by mail or other means) more than $10,000 in monetary instruments on any occasion into or out of the United States, or if you receive more than that amount, you must file Form 4790 (PDF), Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments with U.S. Customs (Currency & Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, 31 U.S.C. 1101, et seq.). Failure to comply can result in civil, criminal and/or forfeiture penalties. 
Monetary instruments include U.S. or foreign coin in current circulation, currency, travelers checks in any form, money orders, and negotiable instruments or investment securities in bearer form. A transfer through normal banking procedures which does not involve the physical transportation of monetary instruments is not required to be reported.
