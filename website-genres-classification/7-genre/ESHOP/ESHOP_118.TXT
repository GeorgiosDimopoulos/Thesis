                                                                                                              I love your dvd rental service - it's just great. I'm using it to catch up on all those               pieces of cinema history I never got to see, as well as check out more recent films before               deciding whether to buy them. Service is quick and efficient, and the change to the renting               button makes it no hassle at all to queue films. And it's good value.
   Jacky Walker from Castle Acre, Norfolk
Great range of foreign, independent films and viewer reviews.
   Adam Bennett from Muswell Hill, London
Your service is first class and I have recommended you to friends and colleagues. Well done all   round!!
   Ron Aitken from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire
Some feedback for you:
 LOVE your films
              LOVE your service
              LOVE the price
   Keith Bennett from Dunblane, Perthshire
I am very impressed by the service provided by Lovefilm. The fast turn               around, reliable and realistic delivery times, and superb collection of               dvds. I have also trialled your rival companies, but found the service               provided by LoveFilm that much more reliable, and will therefore be               continuing my membership after the trial period. Keep up the good work.
   Cam Chong from Croydon, Surrey
We've been members more or less since my daughter was born 4 months ago and we've had consistently brilliant service from you guys - and what an amazing range of films. I constantly recommend it to people too - word of mouth is by far the best form of marketing. Congratulations!
