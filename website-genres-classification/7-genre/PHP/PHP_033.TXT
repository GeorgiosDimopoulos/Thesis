Mark also regularly teaches Econ 501A (another first-year microeconomics doctoral course), Econ 696R (an advanced doctoral course in microeconomic theory) Econ 431 (Game Theory and Decision Theory), Econ 511, (an MBA course on information economics and the Internet), and Econ 361 (Intermediate Microeconomics).
