Like It? 
As I was driving home from work today with a fag in my hand I paused to consider whether I like the person I currently am.I fear not.I'm pretty unhappy, fairly angry, unable or unwilling to do anything about it and not relating well to other people.Note to self. Buck your ideas up.

It's A Farce 
Regular and loyal readers will no doubt recall that I am appearing in an amateur production of a farce written in 1957.Yesterday brought the first performance which was about as farcical as it could be due in no small part to me running off stage in the middle of one of my scenes, running on stage twice when not required to do so and making a very poor fist of improvising missing props.The audience laughed which is in no way demeaned by the fact that several of them we're wheelchair bound, a couple had mental health issues and none of them get out much.Two more performances to go but we're having an additional rehearsal tonight which will probably be slighly more pointless than all the other's we've had over the past five months as most people seem to have lost interest and like me are counting down the days to Friday when we can forget all about it.My friend phoned and told me that I should try to remember that the mere fact of appearing in an amateur production on a very small and sparsely populated island will probably induce hilarity in years to come. It's no doubt sound advice and gave me a crumb or two of comfort but has failed to make me laugh just yet.Perhaps at the Meet The Stars party on Friday I'll be found bent double with tears in my eyes but until them I'll make do with a pained expression and a heavy heart.

Have I been erased? 
I haven't been able to see my blog for some time now. I wonder whether adding a new entry will change that?

Like A Pancake 
Flat that is.Been back a couple of days, feeling numb.No particular reason I care to dwell on although a little self analysis would no doubt reveal a few glaringly obvious suspects.Can't be bothered.Not ready.

Transit 
Currently waiting at Singapore airport for a flight to Melbourne which follows a flight from Tioman, all of which will conclude in the inevitable flight to our small island home.Syated at a lovely spot on Tioman, Nazri's Place on Air Batang. I had the impression that Tioman was over developed but it's a very serene and understated sort of place.Saw a turtle, a shark, monkey's and monitor lizards and the bottom of lots of glasses of beer.The observant among you will note that I'm not showering the praise but neither am I complaining.More excitement and revelatory passages of prose will no doubt follow from King Island.

Jeepers Creepers 
No sooner did I get back home than I've left again. Not sure if that makes any sense but I'll think about it later.I'm in Cherating at the moment and have been for two days so far. Very nice, came here about 15 years ago and was a bit dissapointed with it after being spoilt by the beaches of Southern Thailand. Now it's much more built up and curiously enough more pleasant to my tastes.Leaving tomorrow for the Perhentian Islands.Not much of a travelogue is it.

Back Home 
So many confusing things to write about on an exceptionally poor connection, on a laptop, on a friends floor on South London.For a start we're supposed to head for Malaysia in a week or so but I'm struggling t consider t moral implications of holidaying at such a time so close to the centre of the devestation. We've looked int volunteering but they are encouraging people to give money and stay away from the worst places and still go to the nearby places which depend on the proceeds of tourism.Plus there's the whole being back thing which looks incredibly self indulgent on the same page as moral considerations about the tsunami but...what wouldn't.Hopefully I'll find a better connection and a more conducive environment soon but if not, I'll suffer alone.

Off The Rock 
Today I will mostly be in Melbourne having managed to fly off the island despite pretty strong winds. The take off was surprisingly smooth and we didn't hit much turbulence until Tullamarine which was odd as I was being blown hither and thither on my way back from a dinner party the previous evening.That's not to say that I'm complaining as the weather on Friday and Saturday was pretty much perfect and led to the inevitable questions concerning why I'm not more keen to live on the answered. The inveitable answer is that my work is shit and it's only sunny for a few days every year but still, I'm looking forward to debating quality of life issues with friends back in the UK.Melbourne has been pretty unremarkable. I met up with Merdith for dinner and a drink and have mailed a pretty patheitc at Chrismas shopping. I think my problem is that I started at Myer in the baby department where it was all I could to keep myself from puking. Why anyone would want slogans and brand names emblazoned all over their 6 month old child is beyond me but I did manage to seek out an innofensive cardigan.The sun is out now but it was windy and cool yesterday so I'm a little concerned as to the well being of the cheese we're planning to smuggle back into the UK. According to DEFRA we're not allowed to take any but we're going to give it a go.Time for a coffee then it's ready, steady go to the airport bus and away.

About Me
Name:beefandcheese 
Location:Very small island, Australia 
Despite compelling evidence to the contrary this was never meant to be about either beef or cheese, subjects in which I have little more than a passing interest. It is true however that the fates have recently conspired to find me work at a cheese factory but this is little more than a cruel, coincidental joke told at my expense.
