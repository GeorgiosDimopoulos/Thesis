the external perspective on my internal perspective on life

RE: 9-11  
as the whole world knows (and will never be allowed to forget), today is september 11th. to be honest, i feel no special attachment to this day. perhaps b/c it doesn't feel like it happened two years ago. it feels like it is a distant dream. either that, or it happened yesterday. the world trade center attacks changed all of our lives forever, yet doesn't seem to have changed us at all.no, no more of that...this is supposed to be about me, not my philosophical soapbox rantings about the mindless masses...i can still picture that day clearly even w/o closing my eyes. rushing to my room after class like a true media junkie to catch live coverage of what was sure to be a notable, albeit soon forgotten, news story. "a plane" had hit the world trade center the girl in my 9:25 said. that probably meant that some crazy civilian pilot has managed to jam his cessna into a skyscraper...my roommate was watching "little house on the prairie." "turn it to cnn" i said. and then.... oh my god.... it couldn't be real. one tower collapsed, crowds fleeing in panic. on the phone with my mom, giving her descriptions of things she could only hear on the radio. and then the second tower goes. oh, god, no. speechless, but screaming inside. so helpless...and now, two years later, still helpless... helpless to explain why. why my god allows such tragedies to fall on us. why human beings are supposed to be the most advanced species yet are so unreasonably cruel to one another. why i have the ridiculous hope that i can make a difference...september 11...for me, a day of death. not just of the thousands who lost their lives in nyc, dc, and pa, but also the death of my faith, the passing of all hope. the hope that anything or anyone, deity or otherwise, can save us from what we have become...yes, virginia, there might be a santa claus, but how could he make any difference... posted by Galen at 11:16 PM

college is the one time in your life when you have no qualms about eating burned pizza. after all, you spent a perfectly good dollar on that pizza, no sense in letting it go to waste...today's crusade: light pollution. with all of the technological marvels that man has designed he still has not managed to produce a light that doesn't shed a goodly portion of its energy up into our night sky. is it any wonder we don't know what the stars look like anymore? stars put our lives into perspective. only by gazing at the stars can we realize how terribly insignificant we are. sometimes...i really enjoy being insignificant...spent another hour hiking up and down the moonbeams with sarah jane tonight. i must say it was a happier path than the one we took saturday night. it is so good to see her doing better again. i can't stand that look of sorrow she gets; it tears me up inside like a physical pain. i don't know how she stands it sometimes. she's such a strong woman. if she was in tolkien's tales, she would definitely be an eowyn. a survivor, a loyal comrade with a hidden strength that gets her through the darkness. or so it seems... the darkness still hangs thick over minas morgul and threatens to engulf osgiliath at any moment. here in minas tirith we wait with bated breath and hope for the dawn... posted by Galen at 1:59 AM

lunar soliloquy  
i have discovered the secret to world peace and unity - the moon. the moon is the one thing that we all share. it dominates the night sky no matter where on our planet one may be. and so we all dream with the moon, we cry with the moon, we share our memories with the moon.while standing on a hill under the almost-full moon floating in crystal clear skies last night, i was awed by the fact that while i was gazing up at the moon here in central KY, so were millions of people all around the globe. there were lovers on the banks of the siene last night who walked under the same moon. and farmers and cowboys out on the great plains. and bedouins in the arabian desert and inuit in the cold canadian north and amazon tribes and third shift factory workers.somewhere an elderly widow looked at the moon and saw her husband. a young kid on a midwest farm saw the moon through his brand-new telescope and decided to become an astronomer. a newly-wed couple planned their future and their family. on and on... so many stories... and i was there. the moon kissed all our cheeks ever so softly. a kiss that took us away. away from our troubles, back to the past and into the future. the moon took us from our presents and made our lives a little better, if only for a few minutes. we were free, we were one, we were under the moon... posted by Galen at 12:17 AM 0 comments

and so it begins...  
and so it begins...my new journey to... wherever. my attempts to get what's inside my head outside for me to look at. and whoever else...last night, we had just finished Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure when i found an IM from SJ. Silas left her last night. I felt so bad. Never saw this coming. They had been having problems for the past couple weeks, but I wouldn't have picked him to be the one to leave...She was so torn up inside. I could tell that from her IM. I went over and we went for a moonlight walk for a while...I never feel like I know what to say in times like these. How can one express the deep sympathy that springs up from within? How can one use glib expressions of support to slap a pathetic band-aid on someone else's pain? I wanted so badly to make everything better for her, but I couldn't. No one could, except for Silas, and he wasn't around (which was good for him b/c I think I might have vented my anger towards what he had done to SJ in some not so pacifistic ways...) (not that that would have done any good, of course). So we walked and talked about nothing, about everything. The sky was clear and cold; I was freezing in my t-shirt. But the moonlight was somewhat cathartic. By the time we returned to her house, she was somewhat better.She cried again this morning though. I still don't know what to do... posted by Galen at 9:05 PM
