My Madness in March 
I know that I made my final four picks about a month ago and others have started with their advice.Let me recap my predictions and make new ones:I first picked UNC for my first final four team. I will still pick this team in my bracket. It is a tough call though, the Syracuse bracket is very solid. Their are 3 highly potential final four teams in UConn, KU, and UNC, each of these teams has the potential to make it to the final four. It will be difficult for each of these teams because there will be others standing in their way. Teams like Villanova, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin (a long lost final four pick), and NC State. Their are some sleepers in Charlotte, New Mexico, and Iowa State, all can put together a few strong games.My second pick was Duke. I retract my statement. Once their bracket was studied, I could not pick Duke. Duke received a #1 seed because the last 3 games of the year they won, while KU, Wake, Arizona did not. The Austin bracket, for me, was the toughest to pick. The teams were very even across the board. No sleepers, just contenders. Duke, Syracuse, Mich St., Utah, Oklahoma, Cincy, and Kentucky all have the game to make it to this brackets final four. The team I pick to be left standing in this bracket is the 'Cuse. They are my team and have been for at least 8 years. I finished in a top 5 the year they won the tourney because I was stupid enough to pick them. The problem was I screwed the pouch (no homo) on the rest of the bracket.My third pick was Wisconsin. We don't need no stickin' badgers. The were thrown into a tough bracket and will faded away. So I now look at the Albuquerque bracket (the hardest spelling bracket every). This bracket is tough to call to because the lack of a dominant team. You have Washington as a 1 seed, but the weakest one seed. Washington is good, but very very beatable. So who to pick? Well you have Wake as the 2 seed, very strong, but also very beatable. You have Gonzaga as the 3 seed, I liked them when they were a bracket buster. Since they started to get "respect" from the committee they have shown me nothing, nothing. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. The 'Zagas will lose to Texas Tech in the second round. So there is Texas Tech who showed me some determination in the Big 12 tourney, so I will take this 6 seed as a contender. But Tech might have to play Wake in the sweet 16, unless the sleeper team of Creighton wakes up, which they can and will. But let us not forgot Louisville, probably the most solid team in the bracket, my main concern is Georgia Teach who can come ready to play. So in the end, if I wish to make some money, I pick Wake. But if I stay true to my heart, I pick Louisville. Gotta love Pitino.And finally the Chicago bracket. I like Illinois and they definitely got a huge blow job from the committee (a big homo). They don't have to drive more than an hour to play any one game. Although not really home court advantage, they will have fans in full force. I fill sorry for Arizona who was my fourth pick because they have a great team to make it to the final four, they just got stuck in a touch bracket. Along with the Illini, we have OSU a very deadly team too. This bracket overall is easy to call. Illini.So in recap we have (1) UNC, (4) 'Cuse, (2) Wake, and (1) Illinois. I like the odds and of course in my heart I would love for the Orange to take it, but I do believe UNC will beat Illinois in the final game. I would also like to make predictions on upsets in the first round:9 Nevada over 8 Texas11 UAB over 6 LSU10 Creighton over 7 West Virginia9 Miss St. over 8 Stanford10 NC State over 7 Charlotte12 Old Dominion over 5 Mich St.13 Vermont will not beat 4 Syracuse, but they have the best change with Coppenrath. If this happens, I'm screwed. (no homo)And really, is a 9 beating and 8 considered an upset? According to the bracket Gods it is.So in the end, I wish everyone luck with their brackets. If you take my advice you are either very wise or very stupid, we will find out over the next month.On a side note: I will be in NYC from the the 16th to the 20th so no updates for a few days.

Mythbusters 
Trying to burn down a boat with the heat from the sun. WHAT!Apparently most of my t.v. viewing is focused on the Discovery Channel and shows like Mythbusters. This show is so interesting to watch because, literally, there are so many ridiculous myths alive in the world today. I caught one show where they were trying to prove you can break out of jail by using salsa to eat away at the bars in the window. Are you kidding me? But you know what, salsa ate away at the metal. And you can speed up the process with direct current and be out of jail in four-five months. Shit like this amazes me.Anyway I want to come up with a list of myths that we can send into the show and have them test. My friend DTenz and I already thought of one, breaking the seal. It would be awesome to be the test subjects for that one. But I want more! And if you haven't caught the show you should. They don't really have a time slot on the discovery channel, but are usually on late at night on the weekdays and early morning on the weekends. The last show the tested to see if yawning was contagious.

NL Still has to go through STL 
According to Espn's Peter Gammons, the National League is still belongs to the Cardinals. What can I say, well, I don't disagree. Leave it to Walt to make some of the best offseason moves. Yeah the Cards lost Renteria, Womack, and Matheny, but apparently the Cards improved where they lacked last year.With the addition of Grudzielanek, the infield will turn double plays with much more efficiency. Not only that, but Grudzy's OBP, career .330, is much higher than Womack's. But he is a past Cub which kind of sucks. The loss of Renteria could never be replaced, but with Eckstein, the Cards will have a reliable SS. We still have all the big bats in the line-up and all we need from Eckstein is a good .280, career .278, which he is capable of doing.The pitching is were the Cards should shine again. Their rotation was feared by many in the league, but never got respect from the fans of MLB. They were second in the NL behind Atlanta by .001, and they allowed the second fewest walks. Nobody would ever say the Cards had a great pitching line-up because of the lack of big names on the mound. Addind a big name like Mulder and keeping Carpenter, Suppan, and Marquis the rotation should dominate once again.Really it comes down to small ball, which the Cardinals are very good at. Not only does the middle of the line-up go yard, but they are very good at hitting, filling the bases, and running the bases. These guys make everyone around them pick up their game. Why do you think Womack had his best season ever? Why do you think our pitchers won so many games?I would say the Cardinals will top the NL Central again and win around 90 games. I won't predict the post season because anything can happen.
