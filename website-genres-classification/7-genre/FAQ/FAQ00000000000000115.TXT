My ex-spouse is delinquent in paying child support. The attorney general has filed some sort of paperwork with the IRS to withhold my ex-spouse's tax refund. How would I receive the withheld refund?
The answer is different for each state. You need to contact the state link to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Children & Families Office of Child Support Enforcement where you live to get this information.

How do I know if I am an injured spouse?
When a joint return is filed and only one spouse owes past due federal tax, past-due child and/or child spousal support, a federal debt, or state income tax, the other spouse can be considered an injured spouse and can request his or her share of the joint refund. If this situation applies to you, file Form 8379 (PDF), Injured Spouse Claim and Allocation, to recover your share of the joint refund. 
You are considered an injured spouse if you: 
* Filed a joint tax return, 
* Have reported income (such as wages, interest, etc.) 
* Have made and reported tax payments (such as federal income tax withheld from wages or estimated tax payments) or claimed the earned income credit or other refundable credit, and 
* Have an overpayment, all or part of which can be applied against the past-due amount.

When should I file the Form 8379?
You can file Form 8379 (PDF), Injured Spouse Claim and Allocation, with your joint return or after you have filed. If filed with your return, attach the form to the return in the order of the attachment sequence number and enter "Injured Spouse" in the upper left corner of the return. If you have already filed your joint return, mail Form 8379 by itself to the same IRS Service Center where you lived when you filed your joint return. Be sure to include copies of all Form W-2 (PDF) Form W-2G (PDF) both spouses and any Form 1099-R (PDF) showing income tax withheld.

Is there any way to find out if I need to file an injured spouse claim before I file a return?
Your spouse can ask the agency that might be claiming the refund for a past-due debt. Another source of information is the Financial Management Service Help Desk at (800) 304-3107.

My spouse's refund is to be held by the government. Can I file separate or is there an injured spouse clause that I can file to receive my share of the refund?
You can file separate or you can file a joint return with a request for injured spouse relief. To file for injured spouse relief, you need to file Form 8379 (PDF), Injured Spouse Claim and Allocation. Attach the form to the return in the order of the attachment sequence number and enter "Injured Spouse" in the upper left corner of the return. If you have already filed your return you can file Form 8379 by sending it separately to the same IRS Service Center where you filed your return.

I live in a community property state. Can I file a Form 8379?
Yes, but only if you are not the spouse required to pay the past-due debt. Overpayments involving community property states will be allocated according to state law.
