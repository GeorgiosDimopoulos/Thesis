Reboot using the Windows 98SE bootdisk and format the hard disk again, this time using the following switch: format c: /s This should copy over the system files required to boot your machine from the hard disk.

Re: Boot problem with boot floppy 

Check that the partition is set as active (bootable) by booting from your floppy and running FDISK. Also ensure that BIOS is set to boot from your hard disk.
