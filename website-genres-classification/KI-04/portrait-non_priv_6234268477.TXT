Extranet Benchmarking Association™

MISSION:
 The mission of the Extranet Benchmarking Association is to provide a forum for business and government members to identify the best practices of extranet initiatives through benchmarking. 

MEMBERSHIP:
 EBA provides membership at no cost to corporate members who have installed extranets or planning to install extranets.

BENEFITS:
 Some of the benefits of the association include:

* Being part of a group dedicated to capitalizing on the benefits of the extranets; 
* The opportunity to participate in regular benchmarking studies focusing on leading edge processes; 
* Receiving a monthly newsletter; 
* Recommendations on innovative articles, books and courses on benchmarketing; 

DISCUSSION:
 The Internet is spawning offshoots in the form of intranets and extranets resulting in significant opportunities for increased efficiencies and profits. The extranet potential is limited only by the business strategies and methods employed. Extranets are a natural evolution taking advantage of the Internet infastructure and previous internet investments to focus communications to exchange information and share applications with business
 partners, suppliers, and customers.

EXTRANET USES

* Extranets are presently being used as: 
* Project management tools for companies and collaborating third parties. 
* Sharing proprietary ideas with select a select group. 
* Online training for resellers 
* A way of using high volumes of data using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 
* Sharing product catalogs and inventory levels exclusively partners 
* Collaborating with other companies on joint development efforts 
* Providing services offered by one company to a group of other companies, such as an online banking application managed by one company on behalf of affiliated banks 
* Share news of common interest exclusively with partner companies 

BENCHMARKING
 Benchmarking activities allow organizations to know where they stand in relation to other companies, provide evidence of problem areas, pitfalls to avoid, and demonstrate best levels of performance and solutions.
