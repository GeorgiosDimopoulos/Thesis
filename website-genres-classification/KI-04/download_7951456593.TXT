We suggest that you download the GNU Privacy Guard from a mirror site close to you. See our list of mirrors. To locate a source package (indicated by an `S') on a mirror, follow the link to the gnupg directory; to locate a binary package (indicated by a `B') follow the link to the binary.

The table below provides links to the location of the files on the primary server only; you may select between using the FTP and the HTTP protocol.
