Here are the PuTTY files themselves: 

* PuTTY (the Telnet and SSH client itself) 
* PSCP (an SCP client, i.e. command-line secure file copy) 
* PSFTP (an SFTP client, i.e. general file transfer sessions much like FTP) 
* PuTTYtel (a Telnet-only client) 
* Plink (a command-line interface to the PuTTY back ends) 
* Pageant (an SSH authentication agent for PuTTY, PSCP and Plink) 
* PuTTYgen (an RSA and DSA key generation utility). 

LEGAL WARNING: Use of PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink is illegal in countries where encryption is outlawed. I believe it is legal to use PuTTY, PSCP, PSFTP and Plink in England and many other countries, but I am not a lawyer and so if in doubt you should seek legal advice before downloading it. You may find this site useful (it's a survey of cryptography laws in many countries) but I can't vouch for its correctness. 

Use of the Telnet-only binary (PuTTYtel) is unrestricted by any cryptography laws. 

The files we offer below are cryptographically signed. We also supply cryptographically signed lists of MD5 checksums. To download our public keys and find out more about our signature policy, visit the Keys page. If you need a Windows program to compute MD5 checksums, you could try the one at this site, or this site. (The MD5 program at the first of those two links is also cryptographically signed by its author). 

Binaries

The latest release version (0.53b). This will generally be a version I think is reasonably likely to work well. If you have a problem with the release version, it might be worth trying out the latest development snapshot (below) to see if I've already fixed the bug, before reporting it to me.

The latest development snapshot. This will be built every day, automatically, from the current development code - in whatever state it's currently in. If you need a fix for a particularly crippling bug, you may well be able to find a fixed PuTTY here well before the fix makes it into the release version above. On the other hand, these snapshots might sometimes be unstable.

Source Code

If you want to do any PuTTY development work, we strongly recommend starting with development snapshot code. We frequently make large changes to the code after major releases, so code based on the current release will be hard for us to use. 
Development source code for all platforms	 
Source:	 putty-src.zip	 (or by FTP)	 (RSA sig)	 (DSA sig)	 
MD5 checksums for the above files	 
MD5sums:	 md5sums	 (or by FTP)	 (RSA sig)	 (DSA sig)

Access via CVS

If you want to keep track of the PuTTY development right up to the minute, or view the change logs for each of the files in the source base, you can access the PuTTY master CVS repository directly. 

You can access the repository by means of CVS pserver. The CVSROOT variable you need is ":pserver:cvsuser@cvs.tartarus.org:/home/cvs". Password is "anonymous"; check out module "putty". In other words, on a typical Unix CVS setup, you can check out a copy of the PuTTY development code using the commands 
cvs -d :pserver:cvsuser@cvs.tartarus.org:/home/cvs login
(enter the password "anonymous" when prompted) 
cvs -d :pserver:cvsuser@cvs.tartarus.org:/home/cvs co putty
(PuTTY should now be checked out for you. You will not need to enter the password again.) 

In case you aren't able to access the real PuTTY repository using pserver, we also provide a tar.gzarchive of the CVS repository, updated every night. So if you want to browse PuTTY's CVS history, you could download that, unpack it, and point a local CVS client at it. Click here to download the CVS archive: putty-cvs.tar.gz. 

Alternatively, you can browse the CVS repository on the WWW, here.
