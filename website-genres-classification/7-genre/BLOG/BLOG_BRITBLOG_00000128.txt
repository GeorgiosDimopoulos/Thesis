...And So It Shall Be Done  
I doubt anyone cares, but for those that may i'm going to be integrating my web journal into this blog. I'm dyin' to get this thing going, so i'm going to make it easier for myself and just have one blog. I plan to bring my old journal entries over here as well, so don't be confused when i start posting new blogs with old dates. I'm not even sure if that's at all possible...we shall see. posted by Brenton at 12:13 PM 0 comments

Damn You January. Damn You Straight To Hell!!  
Alright, the Friday before last, after weightlifting class, i jumped up to grab the rim on my way out of the gym. Taylor Kaufman suggested that i do it again, as it was "cool". The second time, just for fun, i spun on the way up. My foot folded up under me when i landed and i felt (and heard) a sickening "pop" sound. I shot back up and ran to the bleachers, grumbling in pain and giggling at my unbelievable luck all at once. I’m sure the classmates who didn’t know me too well thought i was insane when i pulled my shoe and sock off and, seeing that it was already repulsively swollen, began laughing eccentrically. First, i lose my wallet complete with $200, a debit card worth more money, my driver’s license, my S.S. card, and a bazillion other things i cannot think of. Then, upon returning home after another wallet search (to no avail, of course), my truck broke down. Let’s recap: i lost my wallet, my truck is not working, and neither is my left foot…yep, this month officially sucked ass!! I’ve actually taken all this quite well, though. I find complaining quite entertaining I try not to let things like that get to me; I’m crazy like that. posted by Brenton at 12:10 PM 0 comments

Hope for the Hopeless!?...  
Last Friday i was in Meyer’s office (the school counselor) trying to figure out what the hell to do with my schedule. I was trying to make my schedule as easy as possible, but i had no idea how easy it would get. At first, i was a little stressed about having government another year, and REALLY stressed about my college writing class. I actually like writing a lot, although i really don’t do it too often. I just really, really hate writing classes, i always have. i’d explain why, but that’s a whole blog in itself. Anywho, Meyer pointed out to me that i no longer need to take government; it’s a full year class now, but it turns out we’re only required to take a semester of it. After finding out that i actually passed government, i decided to go to a less complicated social studies class: world geography. That’s now even the best part, not by a long shot. I also found out that i don’t have to take a semester of writing; that’s only for those who plan on going off to college after high school. All i really need to graduate is another English class, so instead i am taking a science fiction reading class. We’ll be reading some novels (we just started on the first Harry Potter book), then we’ll watch Lord of The Rings, then another novel, then we’ll watch star wars. SWEET!! Our final project will be to create our own fantasy. The rest of my classes are computer classes (i’m using one to type this), weightlifting, and my last hour is being an aid for one of the coolest teachers of all time, Mr. Vermillion, at the Middle School. This is so awesome. Hell, i don’t even think i can screw this one up. It looks like i’m going to do it after all, i’m going to break the Knowles tradition, god dammit i think i’m actually going to graduate!! posted by Brenton at 9:29 AM 0 comments

Just Saved $113.92  
I just finished ordering a bunch of CDs off of BMG Music; they were having a kick ass sale. All CDs were $5.99, and after adding 5 or more to your cart shipping and handling was free on everything. I ordered the following: 2 Creedence Clearwater Revival greatest hits albums, 2 Sister Hazel albums, Counting Crows: Films About Ghosts- Their Greatest Hits, The Strokes- Room on Fire, Nirvana- Incesticide, The Kinks: Come Dancing With The Kinks- The Best of 1977-1986, and Bad Company: The Original Bad Company Anthology (a 2 CD set), all for $59.90. I saved myself $113.92!! In comparison to in-store prices it would probably be around $90; a hell of a deal nonetheless. I would recommend BMG Music Service to anyone who even remotely enjoys music. Just go to bmgmusic.com, do some research, and see for yourself how much you can save. I don't work for them or anything, and i will admit that on (albeit rare) occasion i get calls from their sales reps. This would probably annoy most, but i kind of enjoy it; sales people really amuse me...usually. If you have any questions about BMG or anything else, you can always ask; i haven't had any posts yet (except for the one about the cat picture), and that makes me sad. posted by Brenton at 8:04 PM 0 comments    
Slow, Rainy Day  
Holy cow, i'm so bored; i need more friends. Tyler is at work still, and the only way i can call Brett is if i first get a hold of Tyler, as Tyler has Brett's new phone number. Today was the last day of school until, of course, Monday. That is one of the few things i am thankful for...for the moment at least. I have to celebrate Thanksgiving like a million times!! I have too many families. As if that weren't enough (because we are now pretty much done with the log cabin), my dad and stepmom have decided to invite their families here for Thanksgiving...HERE!! My stepmom's family is coming Thursday and will require us to deep fry 3 turkeys, while my father's side is coming Saturday. Two turkeys will need to be deep fried, as there are less people on my father's side. My dad rented a bunch of chairs and tables to go in the basement, and i have to go pick them up at the high school before noon; my parents will be at work. The temperature is dropping quite steadily outside, and it is raining pretty good. I love rainy/stormy weather, but the cold really kicks my ass. Hey Tyler just signed in!! Great, he doesn't know Brett's new number. I need to call Brett to ask if he'll work my shift at D'Angelo's (yeah, he works there, too) Saturday, as i have my dad's side of the family coming for Thanksgiving. My mom is leaving me messages on the callwave, and i need to know what her side of the family will be doing, as well as her boyfriend's, so i think i'll get off now and call.Peace posted by Brenton at 4:51 PM 0 comments

The Hives Approach!!  
The Hives are scheduled to be in Lawrence on December 6th. Lawrence is about 2-3 hours from my home (very rough estimate). I can afford tickets, and I know getting there is entirely possible, but December 6th just happens to be a Monday...a friggin Monday!? My dad is totally against it. I got a few of my friends excited about going, especially Brett. This was, of course, before discovering that the 6th was a Monday. DAMN MONDAYS STRAIGHT TO HELL!! I don't know what I'm going to do; the Hives are my favorite band right now. posted by Brenton at 10:59 AM 0 comments

Gettin There...  
I apologize to anyone who has stumbled upon this pathetic excuse for a blog. I have many ideas, but it's hard to find time to implement them. I have a dial up connection at home, and I get too much hell from my dad for using the damned thing. I mainly work on this thing at school when I should be doing school work. Blogger.com is actually blocked by our school administrator, but with the aid of my good buddy and hacker extraordinaire (just in case a faculty member or one of those pathetic uber concerned parents in the area find this blog-it's quite likely, as some of my teachers use blogger and have blogs themselves-I won't give his name unless permitted), I've been able to figure out a way around that. Anywho, I'll be doing all I can during school to get this thing where I want it to be. I plan to add pics (my senior pictures just came in) and more links and lots of other things. To give an idea of what to expect, my favorite things are music (especially classic rock and low-fi/garage rock, but I like at least some music in all genres), drums, videogames, and writing, among other things. I also would like to eventually start like a journal thing of some sort. I'm also dying to try out this audioblogger thing, but first I'm going to need a calling card or something; the audioblogger number is way long distance from my home in Kansas. Oh yeah, and if anyone has any ideas or anything, email me or post it. Well, that's all for now. Later!! posted by Brenton at 11:34 AM 0 comments

My First Website Entry!!  
Well, this is my first successful attempt at adding a picture. The Hello thing seems pretty cool, but I can't seem to get it all figured out.

About Me
Name:Brenton Knowles 
Location:Halstead, Kansas, United States 
I live in a log cabin with my dad, stepmom, and 2 dogs. I love going out and doing stuff even though i often end up spending nights alone playing videogames or something. I get paid next to nothing working at the local pizza place, but it's better than nothing...for now. I love practicing the drums and the harmonica. I'm not much for setting goals; i have no idea what or where i'll be in the next few years. I'm kind of a loser like that.
