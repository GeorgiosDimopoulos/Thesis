Location in all the wrong places  
Whatever "motivation" is, I'm currently lacking it. I remember when I used to pity the poor souls who hadn't yet figured out what they wanted to do with their life, and I was so concrete about my own future. That was stupid, I see that now. You can't be certain about a future for yourself at 18, 21, 25, without experimentation. I don't think I ever did. I stuck to my mantra (author and poet, published by 29). It's not too late for that still, I'm only 26 (27? I can't remember today) but I feel like the young me chose a track for the current me, and now I'm stuck on tracks I can't get off of.This is that 20-something existential crisis everyone keeps talking about. It must be. What to do with oneself, the true path, blah blah blah. Boring things we don't really want to hear from anyone but ourselves. Worst bar conversation ever. Yet I think it's all most of us really think about. Permanant self-doubt. If it doesn't exist, are you even human?I've thought for so long that potential was in landscape, that the true human influence was all about location, location, location. Like a freaking real estate agent. So I've spread myself pretty thin: Dallas, Austin, Portland, Austin again, New York, Austin again. Looking for answers in climate, horizons, city lines viewed from the wrong side of the river. I admit I found a lot of beauty and inspiration in those views, like how one day I sat on a rock in Brooklyn and watched the sun change the skyline of Manhattan over the course of an entire day. I was wearing waders and got funny tan lines on my legs. I took off my shoes and a few bums asked if they could suck on my toes. Typical Brooklyn stuff. But the city changed dimensions ever so slowly, variating between gleaming silver and a flat, two-dimensional montage. Every hour altered my perspective on the city: glistening mecca, dusty grey wasteland, sun-orange mirage.Which means that whatever permanence I expected to find among the streets of that city (or any city) doesn't exist. I've spent the past ten years looking for answers in places that don't have them. With that new realization firmly in place, here I am in Austin again, finally attempting to create an internal experience regardless of the place. Austin is my old college town, so I don't actually love being here but I'm comfortable enough to be able to forget about the town itself and live in a sort of puragtory. I create the city as I go, as it should be with any place of potential: a blank canvas on which to paint your own experience. Jesus I've had that backwards for so long. posted by K.L.
