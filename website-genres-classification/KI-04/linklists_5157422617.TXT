News Notes

* Gone! - Georgia-Pacific has dropped their (rather minor) collection of MSDS's, so we've eliminated their listing. 21-Jan

* Added - We've added a listing for Scott Specialty Gases under Chemical manufacturers and suppliers below. 20-Jan

* Lost and Found - Redox Chemicals and USB Corporation broke their old URL's. We not only found the new ones, we updated their number of sheets. See Chemical manufacturers and suppliers below. 08-Jan

* Dropped - Orion Research became Thermo Electron. However, there is no easy way to determine MSDS availability on their new site. The matches that come up in their site search are primarily "no MSDS required" statements rather than MSDS's. 08-Jan

* Great new sites - MSDSonline has 1.2 million sheets in their collection; see General Sites. OHSAH in British Columbia has a terrific new site featuring MSDS's related to the healthcare industry; see Government and non-profit agencies. 17-Dec

* Check it out! There were over 92,000 uses of this single page in October (and 175,000+ in our MSDS HyperGlossary)! Check out our usage statistics or contact us about advertising opportunities on this and other pages.
