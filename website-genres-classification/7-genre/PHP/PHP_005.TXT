Hi! I'm a Gin. I'm a mother of three young children. My husband and I are both young(24 &23), but I feel economically we are where the rest of the United States is right now. With BAD CREDIT and the edge of being POOR!!! 	
Poor. Now that is an interesting word. All my life I thought of myself as Middle Class. That was until I left the saftey confindes of my parents house. Now being on my own has plumited me into the realities of what my parents really DID to keep our "Middle Class" lifestyle. Now, I stuggle to keep in that style and my children, too.
    
     Now, grew up in 80s where money was no object and credit was everywhere. That is also what my parents did. Of course, thankfully, my father has willpower in not investing too high in credit. I, on the other hand, DIDN'T get that trait from him. My poor "savings" habit is a long time joke in the family. I serious blame the 80s for my desire to always have the newest things. It wasn't till I saw my own kids start to scream in the stores for the new Spongebob toy or Disney item did I realize our society has made this even worse. Then, I realized it was society but MY OWN spending habits that were causing my kids to feel that if they wanted it bad enough then it was ok to spend the electic bill money. 
        When my husband lost his job. Things changed. We were still spending money like we were when he had a job. After 6 months of nasty fights between my husband, it finally curbed when I realized they were all about money. It's taken sometime but we have been able to minimize our expenses and still live like comfortably! Now I'm going to give you the only tip that I belive is tried and true and when ever you think about buying that new little dress(but its on sale) I want you to think this in your head!!!	
 
Tip#1 No one cares if you have the latest and greatest!!
