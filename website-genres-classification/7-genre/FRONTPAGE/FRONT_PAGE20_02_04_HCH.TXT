Skilling's indictment turns focus to what's next for Ken Lay
 And then there was one. With Jeff Skilling's indictment and Andrew Fastow's plea deal, a key question looms: What's next for Ken Lay? At this point, no one can say. Prosecutors are still investigating Lay and haven't yet decided whether to bring charges. What's more, that investigation is likely to continue for months.

• Failure not an option for Skilling • Skilling's own words
• Why prosecutors pass up polygraphs • Skilling timeline
