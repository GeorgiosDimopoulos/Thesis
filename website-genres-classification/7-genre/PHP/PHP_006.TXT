June, 2004
Shelley and I went to Peru towards the end of May, beginning of June with her family and some of their friends. What a trip! We focused on our time in Machi Picchu, the Sacred Valley and in the Amazon basin, with brief stops in Cusco and Lima. The picture to the left is one from that trip. If you hit refresh, you'll get one of ten pictures in random order. Or you can see all the pics here. 
The year of the five continents continues. Shelley and I are planning on hitting five of the seven continents this year. By virtue of our trip to Peru (and our residence in America) we have hit two continents so far. I leave for a six-week business trip to Japan at the end of June and Shelley will join me for a week-long vacation there in August (number 3). In the fall we plan a trip to Spain with my parents (number 4) with hopefully a sidetrip to Morrocco (number 5). Can you tell that we love to travel? 
Main Story: Trip to Peru
Excerpts from travel journal coming soon... 
Yearly Family Photos Although my family is still young (we're going on 10 months!), I'm a sucker for nostalgia. I've always thought it interesting to see how families grow and change over time. I'm bent on posting at least one picture of my entire family per year on this page. 
Travel Photography I've had the opportunity to travel to a few places in this world. Travel, to me, is like drugs - there is not enough time and not enough money to get your fix. While many of the places I've been to are in Asia and the United States, I'm hoping to rectify that this year by going to Peru and, hopefully, Spain. In any event, here are some of my more favorite shots. 
Thesis on the Japanese Economy While studying at the University of Utah, I wrote a thesis paper on research I had done on the structural reasons why the Japanese economy was having such a hard time growing. The research and writing took place over a 12 month time frame, culminating in its publication in the summer of 1999. 
Wedding Photos Shelley and I were married on August 9, 2003 in the Los Angeles Temple of the LDS church. What a great day that was. We were lucky to have so many of our family and friends there to share the day with us. Here are some of the pictures.
