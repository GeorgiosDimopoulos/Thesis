                                                        Our friend had one (diesel) he went to the big Safari. The trek diesel was under powered.
We took a new Trek for a ride, it was not under powered. Nice unit. We thought we could go from 34' to 26'or 28' but we can't, not rite now.

Good luck
Mike

                                                        There are actually two different (AND I MEAN DIFFERENT) diesel Treks. The early ones are on Isuzu chassis. The later ones on the Chevy P-chassis use the 6.5 GM diesel. The Isuzu chassis is really underpowered but reliable and frugal. The 6.5 has never been considered a very good diesel. Fuel mileage 1-2 mpg better than the 454 gas (1996 vortec and newer) and no longer life than the gas version with a LOT less power. 

The Safari Trek philosophy is a good one for those who want the living space of a 36' but only want to drive a 28'. The 158" wheelbase of the 24' (now called 26') makes them suspect as compared with the 178" wheelbase of the 28'.

                                                        MAVC, the Trek makes so much sense in so many ways, and the fit and finish is good. If the folks at Monaco and Workhorse could build the Trek on a W 20 with a Duramax/Allison 1000 we would be waiting in line. ED.

                                                        I have a 24ft Safari Trek (1995). It is on the p-30 chassis with the 6.5L diesel engine. A diesel puller. Very under powered but has been very reliable. About 9-10 mpg. I find it very easy to drive and very comfortable. Love all the accesories - the solar panel, inverter, levelers, stereo tv, 2 batteries, rear camera, huge refrig, micro/convection oven, fantastic fan, CB radio, nice radio sound. All that said, I found the fit and quality very shallow. (glitz and no guts) But, I have looked at the newer models on the gas chassis and they appear to be a major improvement. 

Would I buy one of the new Treks?. Yes.
Hope this helps.

                                                        I loved the Trek from the moment I saw it. However, the price tag was a little staggering for all that paintwork. With no kids, and mostly doing weekend camping excursions, it is the perfect size. However, in 2003, Holiday Rambler started building the Traveler. Same floorplans, same disappearing bed (because Monaco owns both) but much less expensive without giving up any of the quality, in my mind. Since having the 28 ft, I would not go smaller. You would lose a lot of room in the bathroom/closets in the 26ft. Only problem is, I don't let our two boston terriers sleep with us in the RV. I'm afraid they might fall out in the night!

                                                        Some comments:

The pricing between the Traveler and Trek is exactly the same from Monaco, any difference you see is a dealer pricing decision.

2003 model come either with the Ford or Workhorse P32 chassis with the P32 costing about $3K more. The workhorse version of 3011 model comes on the W20 with the 5 speed allision for about $6K more then Ford. 

The P32 version of the 2610,2620, 2630 and 2640 has 1000lbs less GVWR then the Ford. On all the P32 models, they have 2000lbs less GCWR then the Ford. The W20 is basically equal to the Ford in GV and GC.

Since Ford and Workhorse do not make and seem to have no plans for a front engine diesel, the only choice is gas.

I think Trek quality started dropping off in the last years of being owned by SMC but has been brought back with the change of ownership to Monaco.

                                                        Chris,

Does the Trek you are considering have the "magic Bed" ? If so, you might want to consider, if you like to take a daytime nap often, the extra trouble of lowering and raising that bed each time.
