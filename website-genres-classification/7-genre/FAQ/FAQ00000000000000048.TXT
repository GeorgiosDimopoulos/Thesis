   Subject: F1) What regions around the globe have tropical cyclones and who is responsible for forecasting there? 
There are seven tropical cyclone "basins" where storms occur on a regular basis: 
WMO 
1.  Atlantic basin (including the North Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea) 
2.  Northeast Pacific basin (from Mexico to about the dateline) 
3.  Northwest Pacific basin (from the dateline to Asia including the South China Sea) 
4.  North Indian basin (including the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea) 
5.  Southwest Indian basin (from Africa to about 100E) 
6.  Southeast Indian/Australian basin (100E to 142E) 
7.  Australian/Southwest Pacific basin (142E to about 120W) 
The National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, USA has responsibilities for monitoring and forecasting tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific basin east of 140W. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center has responsibilities for the remainder of the Northeast Pacific basin to the dateline. The Northwest Pacific basin is shared in forecasting duties by China, Thailand, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. The North Indian basin tropical cyclones are forecasted by India, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, and Sri Lanka. Reunion Island, Madagascar, Mozambique, Mauritius, and Kenya provide forecasts for the Southwest Indian basin. Australia and Indonesia forecast tropical cyclone activity in the Southeast Indian/Australian basin. Lastly, for the Australian/Southwest Pacific basin Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, and New Zealand forecast tropical cyclones. Note also that the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues warnings for tropical cyclones in the Northwest Pacific, the North Indian, the Southwest Indian, the Southeast Indian/Australian, and the Australian/Southwest Pacific basins, though they are not specifically tasked to do so by the WMO. The US Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii does the same for the Pacific Ocean east of 180E. (Neumann 1993) 
Note that on rare occasions, tropical cyclones (or storms that appear to be similar in structure to tropical cyclones) can develop in the Mediterranean Sea. These have been noted to occur in September 1947, September 1969, January 1982, September 1983, and, most recently, during 13 to 17 January, 1995. Some study of these storms has been reported on by Mayengon (1984) and Ernest and Matson (1983), though it has not been demonstrated fully that these storms are the same as those found over tropical waters. It may be that these Mediterranean tropical cyclones are more similar in nature to polar lows.
The following are the addresses of tropical cyclone centers listed above that are responsible for issuing advisories and/or warnings on tropical cyclones (thanks to Jack Beven for these):
