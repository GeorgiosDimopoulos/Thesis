Introduction
Updating copyright and intellectual property laws to meet the challenges of the networked environment has been a key focus for Congress, the courts, and state legislatures for several years. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, peer-to-peer file sharing and digital rights management, and legislation to create additional protections for databases have dominated the agenda. Debate and consideration of a large number of copyright and intellectual property bills and court cases has occupied ARL staff this year. The latest news about copyright and intellectual property is in the E-news, Section One.

Court Cases/Legal Decisions

International Activities
Canadian Court Rules in Favor of ISPs In a 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are "intermediaries" thus not responsible for paying royalties to performers and composers of music downloaded by the ISPs' customers.   The Court noted that although ISPs provide hardware and the technology required for access to the Internet and the World Wide Web, ISPs are not responsible for content, thus what their customers download.  In a vastly different approach than in the U.S., where the recording industry has sued individual users and P2P file sharing services, the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN) sought to make the ISPs liable for music downloaded by their customers.   The Canadian Association of Internet Providers representing the ISPs argued that SOCAN should seek royalties for downloaded music from the websites that provide access to those works.
