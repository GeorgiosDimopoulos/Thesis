Research Information

Research Projects:

* Wisconsin Multifacet 
* Memory System Performance Tools (WARTS) 
* Wisconsin Wind Tunnel (WWT) (now completed) 

Research Summary 

My main research goals lie in developing cost-effective computer architectures that take advantage of rapidly changing technologies. My research program has two major thrusts: 

* evaluating the performance, feasibility, and correctness of new architectures, and 
* developing new tools and techniques to facilitate this evaluation. 

My current work is mostly part of the Wisconsin Multifacet Project that I co-lead with Mark Hill. Multifacet proposes to perform research to improve the performance of the multiprocessor servers that form the computational infrastructure for Internet web servers, databases, and other demanding applications. It broadly examines applying prediction and speculation--heretofore limited to processor cores--throughout the multiprocessor system. Relative to scientific workloads, we find commercial applications use fewer processors and suffer many more sharing misses that must be satifisfied by other processors. Both aspects suggest that extending snooping cache coherence might be more attractive than switching to directory protocols. Our initial results seeks to extend snooping by reducing traffic using multicasts snooping or enabling implementation on more interconnection networks using logical timestamps. 

Other recent work includes specifying coherence protocols and understanding database performance. Prior to Multifacet, I worked primarily on the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel Project, which focused on trade-offs for designing cost-effect parallel machines supporting shared memory.
