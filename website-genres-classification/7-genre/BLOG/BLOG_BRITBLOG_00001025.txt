Well, Charles Clarke and Tony Blair got their way by a mixture of bullying, threats and intimidation. This post says it all really…

The remains of old Milburngate
March 14th, 2005 
At first glance, the part of Durham around North Road and the Milburngate shopping centre is nothing special: indeed it is best avoided at night due to the high density of pubs and bars, not to mention the filthy bus station, much in need of renovation. But a few gems remain:
This building, now a florist, is one of the only remaining buildings of the “Old Borough” of Milburngate and Framwellgate, which was largely destroyed in the 1930s due to its dilapidated state. Heavily restored, it dates from the 14th Century and is the only surviving building from Milburngate Street, which now lies buried under the awful Milburngate Shopping Centre.
More information on the history of this area can be found here.

Spring is coming…
March 11th, 2005 
Hopefully, anyway! It’s been very cold recently as regular readers will know, but the signs of spring are starting to show. We’re getting lots of finches in our garden from the nearby fields which have been attracted by all the food we have put out for them. I’ll try and get a shot of them soon, but for now, here are some lovely little spring flowers at the foot of a tree in the cathedral grounds:

Europhobia: Thank the Lord for the Lords
March 11th, 2005 
Overnight, the Houses of Parliament have been debating the Prevention of Terrorism Bill. The Government wants the power to slap “control orders” on any and all British citizens without necessarily having to present evidence in public. The House of Lords has been doing its best to preserve our basic civil liberties, and in so doing, is carrying out the functions of the upper house in the greatest tradition of British democracy.
Europhobia has an excellent commentary on events here:
Europhobia: Thank the Lord for the Lords
[Edit: 14:19 GMT] Hurrah! They’re still going strong! Commons to Reconsider Terror Bill Long may it continue.

I am so glad I got out of teaching before it was too late…”watch out children, that pencil case might have a knife in it!”

Proud of Durham, City of : Home
Yep, Labour’s so proud of this constituency that they give us a shoddy, “join the dots” campaign website for the general election. It’s pathetic: I only wish that people were more engaged in the political process, then attempts at talking to voters would have to be more than the half-hearted one we see here - it’s because people don’t seem to care that politicians keep getting away with it!

Sedgefield
March 6th, 2005 
Mothering Sunday today, so we went on a family jaunt to a garden centre on Teesside to get some vegetable seeds (watch this space for developments, we have planted some in a propagator). On our way back, we stopped off in Sedgefield, a lovely little town which also happens to be the middle of Tony Blair’s constituency. I had a quick look around the town centre. It’s got a lovely village green, and the church with its churchyard is also well worth a look. Sadly I couldn’t get inside the church as it was locked….that sort of thing would never happen abroad, it’s really sad that it is common here.
Above: St Edmund’s Church, Sedgefield
Above: The Dun Cow Inn, Sedgefield. Bustling with the Mothers’ Day trade at the time of my visit, it is famed as the pub that Tony Blair took George W. Bush to when he came to visit the North East on his recent State Visit. It looks really nice inside, although well out of our budget while I am in my current job. Their special menu for today was £18.95 per head, but looked delicious!
In other news: I am still ill. My sore throat is horrid and I think I may have to go back to the doctor tomorrow as I don’t think people at work will appreciate my passing this on to them!

Happy Birthday Yahoo!
March 2nd, 2005 
Today is the 10th Anniversary of the launch of Yahoo!, one of the icons of the web today. One of the few companies to survive the dot.com bust, Yahoo is now feeling the pressure from rivals Google, MSN and AOL. But look at the front page from 1995 - hasn’t it changed!

A potted history of St David - I’ve visited the national shrine, St David’s Cathedral, more than once. It’s a beautiful place, well worth a visit.

Snow all gone…
March 1st, 2005 
Boo! It’s melted!
One last look back at the recent weather, then on to more interesting matters, I think!
[Edit] Spoke too soon! It’s snowing again! I don’t think it will settle though, the temperature is (just) above freezing

Winter Wonderland
February 22nd, 2005 
It’s finally got wintry here in the North East: snow showers and cold arctic winds are battering us, and it’s freezing! Still at least it’s fun for the children. We’ve indulged in snowball fights and snowman building so far, and the weather is set to last to the end of the week. Hurrah! Now, where’s my scarf / hat / thermal shirt?

Supporting our local Hunt
February 19th, 2005 
Today was the second day after the ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales came into effect. I’ve been a supporter of hunting for a long time, being well aware of its importance to the rural economy, its heritage, and the invaluable service hunts provide to farmers and other landowners in the countryside. I’ve thought about becoming more involved for a while but ironically, until now have had no idea where to find out more. It seems vaguely amusing that it’s because of this ridiculous, badly drafted and unworkable legislation that I have actually had the opportunity to discover more about hunting in County Durham and the rest of England: I’m now much more aware of the Countryside Alliance’s Campaigns, and every time a so-called “animal welfare” organisation makes a statement in the media I am driven not to hatred of huntspeople, but admiration for their ability to survive such a calculated, bigoted and illiberal assault by people who, by and large, have absolutely no understanding of or interest in the way of life in our countryside. I’ve been shocked by some comments (for example that the ban is “pay back for the miners” - something which is plainly absurd and deeply insulting to former mining communities involved in hunting), and am now determined to do my bit to ensure that tolerance and liberty - two great British virtues - are maintained in my back yard.
To this end, I finally got round to doing what I’d been dying to do for a long time: turn out and support a local hunt meeting. The hunt in question, the Braes of Derwent, met this morning in Lanchester, a few miles west of Durham City and not far from our former home of Langley Park. There was a large crowd of supporters in attendance, and the couple of local bobbies keeping a discreet eye on proceedings had no trouble from us at all: indeed there were no anti-hunting protesters in evidence to cause trouble, and the mood from the crowd was one of pride in their traditions and defiance towards those who would seek to criminalise decent, hard-working people.
I was mightily impressed on the arrival of the pack: they swept into the field where we had assembled, to cheers and applause from everyone. I went to take a few photographs for posterity, and was free to mix among the hounds. They are incredibly friendly animals, and obviously hugely intelligent. After a brief speech from the Master the hunt set off and we were treated to the sight and sound of the hounds and horses as they made their way through Lanchester.
This is, I am sure, the beginning of the end of the Hunting Act. The Braes of Derwent will continue to uphold its proud traditions, and so shall we!
Here’s a few photos of the morning (a few more are available on request):

Marsden Rock and Bay
February 18th, 2005 
We went here for some fresh air on Monday, when I was feeling down. Well, you can’t get much fresher than a northerly gale on the North Sea coast! This was taken with my K700i, and shows the view from Lizard Point looking towards Marsden Rock. There’s a great Victorian Lighthouse here, maintained by the National Trust: on a clear day you can see north to the Farne Islands and south to Whitby from the lantern room! If the weather was better, you could have seen South Shields, and Tynemouth with its impressive Priory to the far side of the mouth of the Tyne. Unfortunately, it was *really* windy, so it’s not the clearest of pictures, but it’s pretty evocative of the “so windy I can barely walk in a straight line” weather we were experiencing!

Frosty Morning
February 16th, 2005 
A perfectly chilly, frosty morning today, so I went for a bit of a walk down along the Cathedral Riverbanks. For those who don’t know Durham, the Riverbanks are one of the jewels of the city - one can completely forget the fact that one is in a town, and imagine what it can have been like hundreds of years ago. The birds were singing and there was not a person to be seen anywhere. It’s the perfect place for solitude if you go at the right time. Unfortunately at the wrong time certain undesirable people hang around there and prey on lone women, but the rest of the time it’s one of the most unspoilt places I know.
Above: Frost adds a sparkly highlight to these plants
Above: Prebends’ Bridge from below. The bridge is usually closed to traffic, and has a lovely atmosphere all year round. The classic view of Durham’s Cathedral is shot from here.
Above: “Kathedra“, a sculpture by Colin Wilbourn, aritist in residence at Durham Cathedral. A depiction of the Bishop’s Cathedra, or throne, it is highly evocative of the power wielded by the Prince Bishops of old. The back of the seat is covered in some wonderful gargoyles:
If you’d like to know more about the Riverbanks, there is a great deal of information contained within the City Council’s management plan. It describes how their use has changed over the past 2000 years and is really quite fascinating.

Another update
February 15th, 2005 
Hi Guys,
I’ve updated the menu for the site a bit, using a very nifty piece of code designed entirely in CSS. I’m not taking any credit for it though, it’s based (with a few minor adjustments) on the Mini Tabs code available here.

Labour Party Spring Conference
February 12th, 2005 
A trip to the Baltic this afternoon coincided with the Labour Party’s Spring Conference at the Sage in Gateshead We were most impressed and rather intimidated by the police’s security operation: it’s been a while since I’ve seen an automatic weapon being carried in public.
Here’s a small shot of some of the mounted patrols around the venue:
