F-u-c-k! This stupid piece-of-shit game is fucking hard. 
I wasted most of yesterday playing it [did you notice? ;)], and what did I get for my troubles, eh?
Academic fucking probation - that's what. Bastards. In furture, I think I'll stick to what I know best; blowjobs blogging.
Oooh, look, Sims 2:Nightlife is out *autumn 2005*. ;)

blogbinders #2 
Contrary to popular belief, I do have ambitions.
One of them is to get published. Fuck, I'd absolutely love to walk into Waterstones one day, and see my book on the shelf. My gorgeous, addictive, best-selling book... that I haven't written yet, ahem.
Thankfully, in the meantime, there's always the *now MT supported* Blogbinders. Woo.

11th march 
I got two parcels from Amazon today (happy happy joy) … one of which being Sims 2 University that I pre-ordered (and which I’ve resisted instalment of… so far… addiction is a bad bad thing, children)… the other one being a random present from the Scaryduck… 
I bet he wouldn’t leave the room as I was about to flick the bean...

what i've learnt 
As I said I would, I've been doing some Coldplay therapy this week. This is what I've learnt so far:
Coldplay are so fucking depressing!
damn.

meme-aid 
The troubled diva is at his fund-raising antics again. Last year it was get-more-comments-than-wil-wheaton-aid, this year it's not. This year it's this: 
Imagine, if you will, the blogmeet to end all blogmeets. One blogosphere under a groove. A sea - nay, a veritable ocean - of "LOVE your work!" hugs, "Darling, you were ROBBED at The Bloggies!" air-kisses and "WHEN is someone going to PUBLISH you!" schmoozes, where tout le monde and their blogroll are getting royally rat-arsed on Vodka Red Bulls, and bopping around like maniacs to the sound of... WHAT, precisely?
Discos... visions of mirror balls, strobes (gah) and really bad dj's who talk through every fucking tune come to mind here. Lots of Darrens and Steves standing around trying to look cool (they don't) in their Ben Sherman threads... and lots of Mandys and Traceys who think a size 14 body looks super-sexy in a size 10 dress.
Have things changed at all since 1995? ... ? Of course though, a bloggers disco would not be anything like that, would it, because we're all gorgeous. And some of us are filthy too. Therefore: can you play Filthy Gorgeous by The Scissor Sisters please, Mike?

don't make me laugh 
Right, fess up - who is to blame for putting The Office at the top of this poll to find the funniest thing on the tele, when everyone knows that accolade belongs exclusively to Only Fools and Horses?
The Office IS NOT FUNNY(!)
And Ricky Gervais has to be just about the most irritating cunt anywhere on this planet. Ever. *grr* Honestly people, I'm shocked and disappointed. That is all.

rock lust 
Dave is sitting over there (*points*) tuning his guitar. I think I'm going to have to sexually assault him.
Very. Soon.

I have noticed that I haven't really rambled here for a while; not like I used to anyway. It's really inconvenient for me that my boyfriend knows of and reads this blog, because I'm fine with complete strangers reading the workings of my fucked-up mind; I just wish dave wouldn't. This was proved the other day, when he was reading my blog while I was sitting right there with him. I got really edgy and insecure, and felt like he was invading my personal space or something...Ridiculous, I know.
I may have to go underground.

I had alot of my emotional cages rattled this weekend actually. And it's pissed me off no end to discover (for the umpteenth time) that burying your head in the sand just doesn't fucking work. Not in the long term anyway. See, I have learnt, through a need to stay sane more than anything else, to block *bad events* out of my mind, so it's almost like they never happened. And this coping mechanism has stopped me being the person I used to be; the person who was constantly weighed down by painful memories and heartache. And I was so sad then. All the time, even was I was *happy, so it's done me in good stead, to a certain extent anyway. The downside, however, is that as soon as I'm reminded of something I've chosen to forget, it completely fucks me up. And that just illustrates to me that I haven't really dealt with anything at all. And then I feel fucked up and useless. Someone told me once that the only way to deal with a painful memory is to think it to its death. All mine are still alive and kicking. I need to work on that. Just like I need to listen to Coldplay's album, Rush of Blood To the Head, alot more. I played it at the weekend, for the first time in aggeees. I don't think I've listened to it since Vespa *went*, and I didn't realise that a] it was one of my emotional cages, b] that listening to it now would stir up such raw feelings, like that whole fucking episode just happened yesterday. Had dave not been sitting next to me at the time, I would've probably cried quite a bit for quite a while; it hit me that hard. Kinda like a punch in the stomach.I didn't cry, but Dave did ask me if I still loved Vespa.
I said I didn't. And I don't. But what I didn't say was that I still have unfinished business as far as that Vespa person is concerned. There are alot of questions that remain unanswered, and while I know they'll probably stay that way forever it doesn't stop me asking them. And because I still loved him when he went, it feels like he took a bit of my heart with him that I can't get back.
Christ, that sounds so melodramatic, but I just don't know how else to describe it.
And all this really bothers me. Yes, I can *forget* again, and I probably will. But I'd rather just get over it. Maybe I'm getting there, sort of , albeit very fucking slowly, because I do find that I'm more angry about it now, instead of just heartbroken? 
Angry that I was so vulnerable I let myself get in that ridiculous situation in the first place. Angry that I have any feelings about it at all when I've got Dave (who means the world to me). Angry that Vespa let me fall for him the way I did when he knew all along that he was going to fuck off and leave me high and dry. What kind of cruel fucking bastard does that, anyway? Honestly, I'd like to smack him right in the face. Really hard. Instead, I've spent a good part of today playing the album, and trying (and so far failing) to get it all out of my system that way.
I really bloody hate Coldplay.

Bathtime can be quite dull ... so why not spice it up by using this on your bits?
Well, it worked for me :)

language. sex. violence. other? 
I'm sitting here, listening to the new Stereophonics album ... And oh. My. God. Edgy, sexy, and grown-up, is what this album is. And I'm loving it to bits.
"All I wanna do is get closer to you, All I wanna do is make a mess out of you..."
Help yourself, Kelly Jones, sir. Woof.
