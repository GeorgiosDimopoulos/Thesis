Amaya 8.2 Binary Release

About this release

Release date: 13 November 2003
 Snapshot 8.2+ date: 13 January 2004

Amaya is intended to be a comprehensive client environment for testing and evaluating new proposals for Web standards and formats. A large part of the intended features of Amaya are implemented in this release, but some of them are not complete yet.

Check out the list of new features.

The Amaya binary distribution is available for PC Linux (GTK/OpenGL), Windows (NT, XP, 2000, 98). Users having other architectures are expected to compile the Amaya source code.

Release schedule

The W3C Position Statement on Amaya describes the planned developments for Amaya.

Between each major release, we may generate patch releases which fix important bugs.

Each a time a new release is made available, an email will be sent to the www-amaya mailing list.

Getting the binary distribution

The binary distribution is available for a set of Windows and Unix platforms.

When installing Amaya for the first time on Windows NT/2000/XP platforms, Amaya will try to create the Amaya user directory in the following order: 1) By looking at the values of the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables, 2) Document and settings\login-name\. WINNT\profiles\login-name. When reinstalling Amaya, Amaya will see if the Amaya user directory already existed in one of those paths before trying to create a new one.

**These distributions include English dictionaries used by the spell-checker. The extra file amayadoc includes French dictionaries.

These are internationalized versions of Amaya. Today these versions work vith a limited set of fonts. On Linux platforms the demo works with ms fonts (see packages msttcorefonts)or Unicode fonts delivered by Markus Kuhn <Markus.Kuhn@cl.cam.ac.uk> (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7emgk25/ucs-fonts.html).

OpenGL versions share configuration files with standard distributions. Binaries are stored within specific sub-directories: Amaya\WindowsGL\bin\amaya.exefor the Windows version, Amaya/GL/bin/amayafor the Linux version.

Some previous Amaya releases are still availalbe in http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Distribution

Installing Amaya

Please follow the directions given in the Unix, Windows, or MacOSX installation notes.

Further documentation is provided inside the distribution tar file and in the Amaya on-line documentation page.

How to change the dialogue language

By default Amaya works with an English dialogue and comes with an English in-line documentation. Dialogues in other languages (French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Finnish) are provided in the standard distribution, but translated versions of the in-line documentation (in French, German, and Spanish) have to be downloaded separately:

When other dialogues are installed, users can change the dialogue language through the configuration menu Special > Preferences > General (fr for French, defor German, esfor Spanish, ptfor Portuguese, itfor Italian, and fifor Finnish).

Installing dictionaries

Amaya includes a spell-checker. By default French and English dictionaries are included in the distribution If your distribution doesn't include them (see Amaya/dicopar/*.dic), you must download and install a dictionary for the language you want to check. These dictionaries are not complete, so the spell-checker could report spelling errors just because the dictionary doesn't include these words.

This is the list of dictionary tar files currently available. :

* Dutch dictionary Dutch.tgz (1228,989 bytes) gzipped tar file (last update: 14 December 1999).
