The pictures above are from the Mary Eagan Garden that adjoins the Cancer Treatment Center at Waltham (MA, USA) Hospital. A personal goal is to see garden patios created worldwide that will provide comfort and solace for individuals undergoing the rigors of cancer treatments. Live and recorded music offerings have led the way to funding the first such garden that we see above. 
This wish-become-reality has led to the formation of a business entity that you can check out at Patio Records. There you will learn of upcoming events, how to purchase CDs from the Patio Records label, and more on Mary Eagan and the garden patio concept....Enjoy clicking away at a number of links below to pages of friends, associates, venues, and a hodgepodge of sites I glean much from. 
Thanks for checking in and headin’ on your way to Patio Records , - T -
