Forbidden Love in Argentina, Priestly Celibacy, Different Flags by Eugenia Renskoff  
Different Flags, a book by Eugenia Renskoff, tells the story of 26-year-old Ani. Ani leaves her comfortable but stifling life in San Francisco to travel to Argentina to comfort her widowed Aunt Esther. Once back in her native country, Ani must face her unexpected feelings of love for Padre Luis, her aunt's young and handsome parish priest. Different Flags is a study of Ani's inner conflict.

Call from San Francisco  
january 8, 1983: My father called last night. Wanted to know how I was, when I'd be coming back. Didn't want to tell him that things have to be different. It's not his fault that I've lived my life like an old lady, like an old-fashioned grandmother in her late 70s. That has to stop. There's still time for me to be young. I'm not even 27 yet.

Call from San Francisco  
January 8, 1983: Last night my father called unexpectedly from San Francisco. Wanted to know how I was, when I'd be coming back. I didn't tell him that things would have to be different if I do decide to go back. They'd have to be livelier, more vibrant. I realize now that so far I've lived my life like an old-fashioned grandmother in her late 70s. Not that the grandmothers around here are old-fashioned. In fact, they're quite modern.But I'm 26, about to turn 27. There's still time for me to be young.

The Worst in me  
Flights and flight reservations bring out the worst in me. I haven't been able to master the art of calm. I don't know how to master it. I think of other times, other flights, other trips and I get sad.

Matilde at last!  
January 6, 1983: Matilde was finally at home for us to talk to. We tried several times and at 5 in the afternoon, there she was. It didn't do us much good, though. She says she'll raise the ent this month, probably by 50 dollars. I told her point blank that she was doing this because of the many dollars she thinks I have. Of course, she denied the whole thing, but it's true. It is because of them. Now what are we going to do? This is a never-ending nightmare for both my Tia and me.

Heat  
January 3, 1983: It's a very uncomfortable feeling, to say the least. This afternoon, on our way to see Matilde, my Tia and I ran into Padre Luis. All of a sudden, I felt that my face was hot and almost humid, though the temperature was only around 75 Fahrenheit. I used my old reliable defense mechanism and stared at the yellow sidewalk tiles again. It was the only thing I could do and I hope he didn't notice my face. Matilde wasn't home, so we'll have to go back again. This suspense is harming my aunt. She keeps dropping things, like dishes and glasses. I don't know what to do to get her mind off this situation.

New Year's!  
January 1, 1983: It was a loud New Year's! At least, it was loud for our neighbors. Fireworks and the sound of people's laughter and the clinking of glasses! That's what we heard from the houses around us. I wonder what this New Year will bring to my Tia and me. Will we find that elusive "home"? Will she find peace? Will I sort out my feelings for Padre Luis? As they say, only time will tell and I hope it tells a good story, a happy ending for both of us.

Lovely!  
It'll be lovely to see and hear the sounds of New York again! The noise, the people, the traffic! Can't wait!

Nerves!  
December 30, 1982: These nerves! The stress of not knowing what to do because I find myself in a strange situation! The stress of wanting to look after my Tia, but not knowing exactly how! Then there's me! my own life, my own fears. Sometimes I feel like I'm living right by my suitcase. I don't know where it'll lead me, don't know whether to unpack it or not!

Almost New Year's Eve!  
December 30, 1982: The neighbors and their kids will be celebrating New Year's Eve tomorrow. I think they'll be buying fireworks and have a big party from 9 P.M. to midnight. I wish I was a part of that, but not with my Tia, at least this year. She wouldn't enjoy it and neither would I.

It'll Be a Joy!  
Being in NYC again will be quite a joy. I'm really looking forward to it. The cars, the streets, the libraries, The Upper East, Upper West, Murray Hill, Midtown, Zabar's, The Plaza Hotel! It'll be a treat!

Summer Navidad!  
December 27, 1982: Our Navidad (also known as Christmas) was quiet and tasty. We had pan dulce (the superior Argentinian version of panetone) and sandwiches. My Tia wasn't up to cooking, and I couldn't convince her thatI am quite a cook. So, we couldn't eat chicken and/or meat. Maybe next year! One thing I do enjoy very much is the heat! It is so warm and nice, about 80 Farenheit. Makes the holiday seem happier. But it's just as commercial here as it is in the U.S. It's all buy, buy! And spend, spend!

Quite A trip!  
December 24, 1982: So far, this has been quite a trip! I have come to a country that once was my own, but no longer is. I have had to deal with problems as if I had been dealing with them all my life. One of the hardest is my Tia. She has one (if not two) feet out the door of "her" house. I don't even know where I am, exactly. Between two worlds, but not quite sure about that, either. I guess this is what happens when one becomes an expatriate.

Nochebuena!  
December 24, 1982: It's nochebuena, Christmas Eve. And it will be a good night, even though my Tia and I will be by ourselves. The neighbors invited us to their homes, but she's not up to it. I remember when my family and I were still living in Argentina, how we would eat at 9:30 or 10 P.M., then towards midnight we'd get ready to drink a toast. At 12 sharp, we'd open up our presents because it was officially Christmas Day. I know this custom still exists, so I bought a present for my aunt. It's a dark blue shift dress. She still wears black. I think the shift will be ok., a change for the better.
