Winter break

The salmon season having started and the mild weather last week giving the chance of a roach or two I took the week off to get in a day or two fishing. Sods Law came into play and the weather turned cold with a low clear river I haven&#8217;t even bothered to get the rods out of their bags. 
The highlights of the week have been a morning attempting to rid the estate road of the rabbits that are determined to undermine it and fixing up the beehives in the workshop. Not the most inspiring of breaks, certainly not what I had envisaged last week.

Pond life

The toads have arrived big-time in the top pond, the evening sound track is audible from the bedroom. An unexpected spring emergence was a grass snake at the lakes, whether his arrival was as a result of the toads being on the move I wouldn&#8217;t like to say. I certainly haven&#8217;t seen a snake in February before and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a normal occurrence, I will have to find a tame herpetologist to ask.

Brook Lamprey

Spring has sprung, hardly the expected cry for early February but today has been fabulous, sunshine and shirt sleeves. We had to remove a fallen alder and several sallows that were blocking the Woodside Carrier and despite spending several hours in the river I never felt the cold all day. Whilst dragging out the trees we beached several Brook Lamprey (Lampetra planeri) one of our EU directed species, it&#8217;s good to know one species is doing well in the river.

Dockens Water

Itâ€™s been quite an interesting few days related to the Dockens Water, see December 16 & 17 entries, not because of any natural occurrence but the intervention of fellow man. I had a freebie magazine pushed through the letter box the other day and contained there in was a piece to the effect that the Hants an Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust were going to dig it up to better suit there needs at the local study centre. Well as you might imagine with over twenty five years involvement with the Dockens and being a MEMBER of the H&IoWWT I thought I would like to see the plans to allay any fears I have re their capability not to damage the redds downstream of their digging about. Well guess what? The donâ€™t consider the input of members to be relevant and they refused permission to view the plans and consents. The next few days should be interesting!!

Bee lines

Mild with even a hint of sunshine mid-morning, gave me the opportunity to visit the bees. Unfortunately the small colony has died out much as I feared it would. I am still unsure how they became queenless so late in the year, hopefully it wasn&#8217;t whilst I was examining them. Obviously they were unable to repair the damage and failed despite food still available and no sign of disease. The other colonies appear fit and healthy and whilst I didn&#8217;t open them my presence was soon discovered and they made their views very clear. They have gorse, hazel catkins and willow just starting to flower so hopefully they will continue without problems. My old WBC&#8217;s are looking decidedly tired and in need of some tlc. I seem to be having some success in detering the wax moths by leaving empty lifts over a crown board to over-winter above the bees. Previous attempts with black bags and chemicals have all come to nought over the past decade but this is the second year the colonies have kept them clear.
