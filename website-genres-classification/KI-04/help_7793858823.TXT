There is a great deal of poaching of rare carnivorous plants. Some of this poaching is probably being done by carnivorous plant horticulturists, so the ICPS developed a program that would provide carnivorous plant growers specimens of these rare plants both legally and inexpensively. The hope is to cut down on poaching by providing an alternative. 

One tricky element to this is the issue of "location information." Carnivorous plant growers (and especially Sarracenia growers) like to know the provenance information for their plants. But location information for rare carnivorous plants is so jealously guarded that the ICPS does not reveal it. So instead, the ICPS conservation program devised the notion of "ICPS Location Codes." This notion was vetted by conservation partners of the ICPS, and they all gave their approval. 

The ICPS obtained a permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service to proceed with its Sarracenia Distribution Program. Hundreds of plants are being distributed within the USA at very low cost to the hobbyist (just a few dollars per plant). The ICPS hopes that this plan will reduce poaching of these rare plants.

ICPS Location Codes consist of a two letter geographic code, followed by a sequential three digit number. Within the USA, the geographic code is the state postal abbreviation. The three digit number tracks the site within the geographical region. The plants distributed in the 2003 ICPS Sarracenia Distribution Program are from sites AL001, AL002, and AL003.
