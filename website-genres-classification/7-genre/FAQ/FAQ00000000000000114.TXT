After you download a tax form, how do you open the file to read it?
Refer to our Frequently Asked Downloading and Printing Questions. 
To view/print a PDF file from the Web, download the file to your hard drive or diskette, launch the Acrobat Reader (an icon will be created during the setup process) and open the file you just saved.

I am having trouble downloading forms and publications from your web site. What can I do?
First make sure that you have the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader software. Adobe Acrobat Reader software is needed to view and print PDF files (the preferred format for viewing or printing IRS forms, instructions, and publications). 
Adobe Acrobat Reader is available free-of-charge from hundreds of sites on the Web, including the IRS web site. However, the best way to get the free software is from Adobe's home page. Their site offers two versions of the Reader, versions for most platforms (Macintosh, all Windows versions, etc.), and they even offer the user his/her language preference. 
Adobe provides comprehensive instructions for downloading the software. 
To view or print a PDF file from the Web, download the file to your hard drive or diskette, launch the Acrobat Reader (an icon will be created during the setup process) and open the file you just saved. The document will appear on your monitor and you can print from there. Some web browsers will launch the reader automatically when you download a PDF file.
