Atlanta Adventure Racing Group

A.A.R.G.

 A.A.R.G. is a loose affiliation of adventure racers in the Atlanta, Georgia area who enjoy training with other people..  There is no official organization, just a rugged group of individuals who delight in the disciplines that make up adventure racing.   There are no mandatory meetings, no officers, no minutes, no incorporation, no insurance, and no dues, just a bunch of people into adventure racing who support each other and train together.  We climb, paddle, ride, hike, navigate, sail, raft, and rappel in preparation for racing, and you'd be welcome to join in.

If you are interested in training with like minded people send an email to receive updates on future training opportunities, parties, and such.
