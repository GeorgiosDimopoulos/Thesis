"They say that sometimes our dreams come true in the most unexpected ways.

The corners of Harry’s lips turned up slightly, going unnoticed by anyone in the ever shifting swarm of people surrounding him. It was a noisy, busy and in general absolutely insufferable gathering and Harry’s brow slicked over with cold sweat at the thought of having to endure talking to all those pretentious witches and wizards who came here to gawk at him.

Instinctively, he sought out the comforting crimson gaze of his husband. Making contact from all the way across the hall full of people, he instantly felt better and steeled himself for the many more hours he’d have to spend in the stuffy, overly populated room.

Now, many things could be said about his husband. That he was a madman, a cruel and ferocious being who cared nothing for the people around him. Maybe that he was an orphan of a cursed bloodline with too much power to be healthy. None of those things mattered though, because – honestly – people could think and talk whatever the hell they wanted and it wouldn’t make any of those things true.

The papers said the marriage had been forced and entirely a political affair.

Harry would beg to differ, but didn’t have the energy to battle the press yet again. His life was far too involved with the Prophet already and if he saw Rita Skeeter again in this lifetime it would be too soon. What he knew and felt in his heart was all that mattered. The golden band around his finger was testimony enough to that, because he could swear to Merlin and Morgana themselves that he’d never get roped into an arranged marriage. Everyone should know well enough that he never followed the rules anyway. He was notorious for butting heads with the Minister for it, but generally came out on top thanks to his popularity and the fact that Fugde was desperate to remain in office and would rather not tempt Harry to try to become the youngest Minister for Magic in history.

No, the political benefits of the union between the heirs of Gryffindor and Slytherin aside, Harry really was in love with Voldemort. It was funny, because a year ago he’d run to the ends of the Earth from an unexpected marriage. Things had changed so suddenly he’d never even noticed when he fell head over heels for the strange, yet enticing Lord of the House of Slytherin. They’d argued over a bill for the protection for Muggleborns out in the Muggle world, sending chairs and people flying with the intensity of their magic clashing as they traded honey-coated insults back and forth. And then, quite uncontrollably, they collided with all the strength of their emotions – lips and hands and bodies coming together all on their own. It had been a violent beginning of something beautiful.

The bill for protecting Muggleborns was revised so many times Harry wanted nothing to do with it ever again, but due to their joint effort, it was fair to both Purebloods and  Muggleborns and, most importantly, protected those who needed it the most. Harry just knew then, that there was more to Voldemort than a man who only looked out for himself. He was self-absorbed and had some serious anger management issues, Harry will forever be the first to admit, but there was something about him that just caught his heart and never let it go.

Now, still reeling from the excitement of the ceremony, Harry couldn’t be happier. His husband – notoriously handsome as always – was giving him a secret smirk from across the hall. It just promised all sorts of pleasurable torture which he would thoroughly exercise on Harry later that night. A little shiver ran down Harry’s spine at the feel of the intense crimson gaze as he tried and failed to suppress a grin from stretching his lips in response.

No one else would know. They could say whatever they wanted, but Harry felt untouchable with Voldemort at his side. He was the luckiest man alive and no amount of pitying stares from strangers surrounding him could change that. Maybe one day they’d see what they’d been missing all along. Maybe not, but either way Harry knew he’d be happy. Taking Voldemort’s skinny, cold hand which gripped his tightly, he felt stronger than ever. Ready to take on the world.

… but first, he could lean in and steal a long, well-deserved kiss off his beloved’s lips.  "
"the swish of his third and incomplete spell carried no meaning behind it.

I rolled away from the rush of wind and flame, protected in part by my cloak, letting it pitch my body forward as he banished the desk across the tiled floor. One hand gripped the surface as I flew over and allowed me the strength to grow stable in the chaotic flight and land on my knees roughly, painfully, but not in defeat.

He turned in an instant to finish what his work had started; but too late, that single instant too late, for I had never ceased my motions even through the destruction of each knee.

The rage burning behind his eyes flared higher as my Chaser-honed reflexes tore the wand from his minutely-weaker hands, and in that moment a low pang of regret registered behind my satisfaction of taking up his Hallow.

My weaker wand appeared in the opposite hand as I banished his body backwards into another portrait of long-dead headmasters, finally taking in their shouts and panic as further flame licked up along their walls.

A basic healing charm undid the damage to my legs in a flare of light and a rush of giddiness as Dumbledore pushed up onto one arm, the shame of both his actions and his defeat openly displayed.

""Thank you for the knowledge... and the gift, headmaster."" I told him softly, freezing the fires in place before any more damage could be sown, rationale returning but unaffected by my victory.

With two in my command the power only coursed that much stronger, like a kindling-flame grown wild before a sudden supplement of consumption.

""James... wait..."" he murmured weakly, too slowly.

I vanished his desk and descended the stone stairway before he could even finish my name. I knew there was only one last to be obtained and then the prophecy would no longer matter, that it could not matter were I lord of them each and all.

Lily could feel the changes in me the moment I walked inside our home, the undisguised look of confusionon her face, but it hardly mattered.

I loved her still, of course, that much had not yet been altered; but I knew after listening to Dumbledore's brief history lesson just what would become of that love in due time, just as it had become of his favor toward Grindelwald, of his own brother and sister.

And a part of me I had not known existed, had perhaps not even been before tonight, whispered it's loathing of her softly in my heart. ""James? What happened? What did Albus say to you?"" She asked in concern.

To lie, or not to lie.

I could not let her take in the Hallows as I had, sharing them as I once did my cloak so foolishly in blind youth. And then I heard his cries and that whisper grew silent for a time, as Lily turned with a moment's hesitation to look in on our son.

""I'll tell you later."" Her eyes grew more concerned before exiting the room and I knew then, taking in Harry's whimpers and whines as the sound both soothed the urges and bore a hole within my heart, that he would be the one capable of washing away their stain one moment at a time.

It made the anguish that formed later as he slept quietly all the more powerful.

With only two in my possession I could not stop the prophecy from coming true, I could not keep either of them safe... yet just how much safer would they be beneath Albus' Fidelius charm without the third Hallow clasped in hand? How long would it take before their blood drenched my hands then?

A high pitched voice cast out the first curse quietly, calmly, and the door exploded inward as only so much ash and splinters. His followers crept at an equally quiet pace forward with the occasional note of mirth escaping from behind stark-white masks.

Upstairs Lily paced in silent madness, protected by several wards I had forced Sirius and Remus into casting a week prior, just before my resolve at last folded from the search.

It was as much to keep her away from Voldemort as it was away from me, though more than once I had tested the measures. Only Harry's voice kept them both alive and safe for another night, another hour, until tonight.

Voldemort himself looked for a moment to stall. His features seemed, perhaps, confused at the sight that greeted the glimmering-red eyes. I supposed my own descent must have looked equally familiar if disturbed, hazel eyes long since darkened to black.

The cloak rested over my shoulders and trailed the ground with a wary note of amusement in the way it never stayed still, wavering as if in a wind no one else could feel or hear.

The wand tapped against my left thigh to a beat of its own choosing, reverberating faint echoes of magic in the wake of each.

And the last, the final of the Hallows, the stone-bound-in-ring glinted on my left finger with an inner-chaotic gleam.

The Death Eaters at his back looked in around their master's shoulders and took note of me"
"of it, and they would be lucky to come out of it all alive no matter which side won.

Class was dismissed, and Draco packed away his things quickly, falling into step beside Perseus as they slipped out into the corridor.

""Shall we get this over with?"" Before dinner, yes. So that after dinner, he and Perseus could go to the library and read and not have to stop to do their work.

He felt his mouth compress, and a headache coming on. ""Might as well. We've plenty of other things to keep us occupied for today."" Playing both sides was nerve wracking, and Draco could admit that he was high strung about it. Who wouldn't be? Just thinking about playing both sides was making him nervous. Still, they slipped out, and started up out of the dungeons, weaving in and out of clots of other students. Not too fast, not too slow, just a pace that wouldn't draw any attention to them. It wasn't as if they didn't have classes in areas other than the dungeons, anyway. Surely no one could find any particular fault with them being in the upper levels of the castle, although considering bloody Gryffindors, they would certainly try.

The mass of students thinned out as they got closer to the portion of the castle they were seeking, and quieter, which made Draco relax. He really wasn't sure to do with all of those people anymore where before he would've pressed through them with no hesitation at all. ""I think I know what section of the library we need to look in.""

""With our luck, you're about to say the Restricted Section. I still have a note from Professor Snape allowing me into it, but I sincerely doubt it'll work anymore."" The professor had been aware of his father's much more extensive library, and that Draco had been taught from the time he could toddle about what he mustn't touch.

Perseus exhaled. ""Well, there went that idea, then. Doubt we'll get any such note from Slughorn."" Slughorn was suspicious of the members of his house, afraid of the Dark Lord's return, afraid of a lot of things. He seemed to have his suspicions about Draco and Perseus as well.

Then again, who didn't? Blaise was still spending most of his nights in various Slytherin beds other than his own, but it was clear that he understood they'd been Marked. Vincent and Gregory had made remarks that implied they knew, as well, and everyone in Slytherin House walked carefully around them despite the general knowledge of the Malfoy family's disgrace. ""Well, what you can't get..."" Draco began, shrugging.

He wasn’t even sure how they all knew it, but Perseus hadn't said, had generally played things close to his chest on that account. Still, to be Marked and Slytherin was granted a certain distance and respect from the other house members. They were left alone, which was how Draco needed, wanted to be. ""Steal."" Perseus sighed, taking Draco down a corridor. ""I think we're being followed.""

Draco didn't turn or glance behind them. It wasn't as if he had to, in all honesty, and his mouth compressed tightly. ""Well, he's going to be a bloody bother, but I doubt we can do anything about it."" One never could where Potter was concerned, even if Draco wanted more than anything to kick him in the face.

""Are you ever just tempted to stop and wave hello at him?"" Perseus asked, a bare whisper as he leaned in to Draco and they turned another corner.

He couldn't help the snort he gave in response before breathing a reply. ""What, and give him heart failure? Potter would see wickedness in a Slytherin if we were working at a soup kitchen."" If the Slytherin in question was his aunt, then it seemed entirely likely that Potter wouldn't be wrong, either.

Draco could certainly see her cooking Muggles and serving them at a soup kitchen, rather than just serving them. ""Still. I'm tempted."" He didn't, though, not this time, and instead they made their way up to the headmaster's gargoyle.

A whispered password got them inside, the gargoyle hopping out of the way as if they had been expected. He honestly wasn't surprised to feel an invisible brush of air against his back, and he stiffened, glancing at Perseus from the corner of his eyes. Surely it wouldn't be ill-done to knock Potter over so that he fell back down the stairs.

Perseus rolled his eyes as they kept up the stairs, shaking his head. ""Headmaster?""

""Ahhh. Mr. Averis. And I see you have brought Mr. Malfoy with you, as well.""

The old man looked bloody awful, like he was liable to fall over dead from where he sat. Perhaps it would be easier to kill him than it had"
"will.

He was aware, but not really alert. Severus had discussed quills and inks, and he had listened but he hadn't imagined what it would feel like to have the soft dry nib, a little sharp, scrape in smooth motion over his pectoral. His nipple perked in reaction, and he held still, very still, trying not to move despite the fact that he quite clearly wanted to do just that -- move, shift, shimmy, and if he had been hard before, it was nothing quite like now, this moment when it all coalesced into something quite real.

""Shhh."" He didn't explicitly silence Draco, so he wasn't sure if that was a suggestion, an order, or an attempt at soothing. The slow scratching continued. ""Where did you get this scar from?""

The memory was just as sharp as it had been the day he had gotten it. He had been standing in the girls' lavatory, sweaty and shaken and in tears, and Potter had come in with his righteous fury and his wand, and Draco had reacted immediately out of fear and shame and who the fuck knew what else. ""You were there."" It wasn't the proper answer, and he knew it. ""Harry Potter.""

He felt the careful scratching of quill against skin, and the flourish of the end of a signature. ""He left you with a great many scars that day. Some that can't be reached with a quill.""

Yes, there had been, but Severus had been there and he had thought quickly, had healed him before the worst set in and raised, twisted along the furrows Potter had left on him. Draco's pale skin had always scarred, pale on pale so that it could barely be seen, but those scars had been made of red angry ridges. It had taken months for them to become white, raised lines. ""Yes.""

He felt the quill nib against the next mark on his body, slow moving, and then the one after that. ""You still wish you could do things to him for that.""

""Yes."" Yes and yes and yes again, and yet he was also pathetically grateful to Potter as well. He had defeated the Dark Lord, made it possible for the world to change and Draco with it. On the other hand, there were the scars, the fact that Severus had been left for dead. Some scars could never be erased.

""We'll deal with that another day."" There was a jagged line on his hip, and he felt the light  pressure of the nib there as well. ""And this...?""

When he blinked, it surprised him to find that his lashes and cheeks were damp. The definitive placement of that handwriting, the name Severus flowing over his scars, it made him feel so much. Memories, yes, but he was making claims over them, and it was cathartic and erotic and fucking Merlin, Draco knew that he was meant for this. Meant to be here this way, meant to belong to him, and he somehow managed to stutter the answer without moaning. ""Aunt Bellatrix.""

""Her end was too good."" He felt the slow slid of a thumb beneath the ink line, at the edge of the scar, and then the brush of lips against the mark as well. No amount of pulling at his wrists would get him more or less sensation than he was getting just then, faint and intense as it was.

He was hard and shivering, watching Severus intently. There was no way to deny the sharp upwelling of emotion as he did, and he curled his fingers into his palms and let out a ragged breath. ""Yes."" Yes to everything, to anything, to whatever he wanted.

Severus's mouth tugged into a smile, still bent over Draco, tracing a line with his finger along the inside of Draco's thigh just then, over a small dent of a scar. ""Ah, this one I remember. Fell off your broom and onto a bench before there was any school to send you off to...""

Dobby had been in hysterics over it, too, slamming his head into the wrought iron of the thing as though drenching it in the blood of a house elf might turn back time. The touch tickled just a bit, and Draco gave a breathy laugh. ""Worth it.""

The sky had been amazing, clear deep blue, and he had wanted to touch it so badly that he had taken his toy broom much higher than it ever should have gone. It had been worth it.

""I know."" He knew, and that signing seemed to have a little more relish in it, because yes, that was what Draco liked, enjoyed best and didn't have any horrible memories attached to. Flying was always good, even when crashing came at the end of it. Severus was like flying to him, and he laughed again, just because it felt good. The scroll of ink against his skin, the caress of potion-stained fingers, all of it. Every moment of it, and a shiver"
"repelling Charms on the basement door.

The sun shines through the holes in the walls and focuses on the ivory and slate kitchen counters. If I could just be the sun and see whatever it shone on, maybe I could see this place the way it was in my memory. Rich splendor and possibility. The musky air pregnant with the chance of a future.

""What do you want to do later?"" he asked.


I shrugged and lifted a stack of old books that didn't seem Dark enough to warrant distraint. ""Hey, look at this."" I said and picked up the portrait underneath.


""Well, I don't know if it's a Dark Artifact just by looking at it, but a face like that should definitely be illegal.""


I bumped his shoulder. ""Don't be rude.""


""Fine, tonight, though. You haven't answered me. ""Dinner? Maybe a show?""


I chanced a quick peck on his cheek and put the portrait back on the floor. It didn't seem to be a Wizarding portrait in any case. ""Fine, dinner and a show. But I need a shower after our search, you'll have to pick me up at home.""


It takes a bit of Transfiguration and some more strengthening Charms to get up to the first floor now, the staircase is completely ruined by the fires that consumed almost everything. You can still see how beautiful it used to be though. Iron railing going three stories up, decorated with a fine Art Nouveau filigree. It's still there, even though the rich Ebony beams shooting up like the trees in a rainforest are gone.

There had certainly been a lot of Artifacts in the Library on the first floor. It's nothing but cold stone and metal beams now, but my memory can fill in the rest. Honey and red used to be the primary colors. Sconces on the wall lighting the place up warmly, and a fireplace in the corner that wasn't lit, but gave me dreams of sitting down in front of it with a good book, while my Husband and the children run about with their dogs or each other. Playing. I'd been able to hear the laughter that is nothing but an echo in the back of my mind now.

It took me ages to rummage through this room. Nothing was ever as it seemed, and even the books on de-gnoming gardens couldn't be trusted. There was just so much to do, and so little time.

""Are you still in here daydreaming? Life used to be so much simpler when I could just curse you for laziness. Now that we're friends, I don't know-""


I laughed brightly and watched him over my shoulder. He was leaning against the doorframe, his arms over his well formed chest. He was smiling that bright smile right back at me, and I winked.


""You like being my friend,"" I retorted and watched him roll his eyes at me.

""I'd rather be your lover.""

""Yeah, I know, but as much as I'd love to jump in bed with you and have my wicked way, I think there's more to you and me.""


He breathed in deeply and glanced out of the narrow window. ""I know, and you're right. Give us a kiss, and we'll try and finish this bloody house at a descent time.""


""Yeah,"" I sighed against his lips and reveled for a moment in the softness and sweetness of his mouth. It definitely wouldn't do to rush something that could be great. Something that could be for life.

I hear my footsteps echo through the this entire side of the house. The walls had been made of wood and beams, and that's all gone now. I step lightly and carefully over stone ledges and a few remaining planks. There's ivy growing inside, and I can see that the doorway that used to lead to the master bedroom is overgrown with moss and other plants.

When I say it used to lead to the master bedroom, that's exactly what I mean. That whole part of the house is gone now. Blasted away by the explosion.

I slide my back down the wall and wave my Wand in the direction of the door frame, clearing my view to uncover fields of green grass and purple flowers.


The ground shook and a loud roar overwhelmed my senses. There were no cries, no screams, no nothing. Just that roaring that could be anything from wild beast to devouring flames.


""Draco!"" I yelled, running through the hallway, trying to get through the falling rubble to the staircase. ""Draco!""


No one replied, and when I reached the main staircase, I could see the fire, and feel its heat.


""Draco!""


I got outside, hoping he'd be out back, maybe jumped out a window when the explosion hit.



He wasn't there. A whole part of the house wasn't there.



And the flames.


""Draco!""

Two strong arms envelope"
"had a choice, a heartbreaking choice, to give in to his desire and to let Voldemort kiss him senseless or run, try to dispel the illusion and destroy the Horcrux… and never know how the touch of the man he had fallen for would feel on his skin.

“I’m going to do much more than just kiss you, Harry,” the Dark Lord announced smugly, his lips turning up into a smirk, immediately making Harry’s heart skip a beat involuntarily. He barely registered the arms unwrapping from around him, leaving him free to back away, reach for his wand or run… but he was transfixed by Voldemort’s handsome features, his high cheekbones, perfect nose, inviting lips… straight, proud posture, a little exposed skin on his neck… he was frozen in place, breathing in nervously. He didn’t dare to break eye contact with Voldemort’s crimson gaze – they were so close now, noses almost touching...

“Then are you going to kiss me or not?” he finally broke the silence, impatient, eager, anticipating. The corners of Voldemort’s lips merely turned up a little again and he remained quiet. Frustrated, Harry closed the gap between them with half a step and put his hands on the man’s chest to lift himself up slightly to reach. He placed his lips on Voldemort’s lightly, nervous and trying desperately to stay calm. He could literally feel the satisfied, victorious smirk form on the man’s lips and then respond to his curious but hesitant actions much more confidently while his hands moved around Harry to hold him close again. He assaulted Harry’s lips with breathtaking ferocity, demandingly and fast. Struggling for breath, he tried to keep up with the pace. The taste of another mouth on his, Voldemort’s taste, was overwhelming. He’d only ever kissed Cho and Ginny before, but this… was different in every aspect possible. Voldemort’s tongue plundered his mouth with swift expertise, the sensation swiping Harry off his feet, quite literally. Voldemort held him tightly though, not pausing his pleasurable assault for even a moment.

Before he realised it, he was being lowered onto a comfortable bed, Voldemort’s body pressing tightly down on him. Large, long-fingered, strong hands roamed over his body and suddenly he felt so, so hot, his body aching to shed every last bit of clothing already. He wanted to be closer, to show Voldemort everything and to see every part of the handsome man’s body as well… he was aroused more than ever before, the need and pleasure blurring his hazy thoughts even further.

Voldemort’s mouth moved to bestow a flourishing of kisses down his neck, surprisingly gentle, enticing an approving moan to rumble in Harry’s throat. He loosened Harry’s tie with a swift movement of his hand and quickly unbuttoned the top of Harry’s shirt, biting along his collarbone greedily.  

Breathing heavily, Harry melted under the man’s touch, easily throwing his head back in pleasure to allow him easier access. His body was eager for more… and that thought sent his mind to a grinding halt. Voldemort ceased his appreciation of Harry’s body and looked up at him, a knowing smirk on his lips, as always. He probably did know exactly what he was thinking…

“You’re hardly a virgin, Harry,” he mused, licking his lower lip a little, his neatly tied back hair now in slight disarray. Harry looked up to the diadem on his head, unable to see it of course and sighed, withdrawing from the man a little bit. “No need to be shy.”

“Well, yeah, but never... with a guy,” he ground out with some difficulty, averting his eyes and desperately trying not to blush. He wasn’t going to blush and faint like some bloody girl! Voldemort chuckled at that, lowering himself on top of Harry again, grinding up against him slightly. Harry squirmed as pleasure briefly flooded his cock at the friction, before it was gone again and he groaned in frustration and embarrassment, because he wanted more.

“Well then, I shall make your first time... spectacular,” Voldemort announced, now moving back again and proceeding to disrobe Harry. “And then you won’t ever want to let anyone else indulge in your body,” he added more quietly, which fell on deaf ears as Harry was squirming under him, embarrassed at being so exposed. Voldemort was still fully dressed, but Harry would soon fix that, attacking his buttons with ferocity matched only by his desire to get closer. The man’s body was impressive, flawless and masculine. Unlike Harry, who was still a bit scrawny and hadn’t taken any steps to maintain his body since he’d stopped playing Quidditch, Voldemort’s body was lean, but healthy and strong. His cock stood erect and proud in front of Harry – somewhat intimidating, really, but he took it in his hand eagerly, stroking it experimentally.

Voldemort was kneeling in front of him on the bed, approvingly"
"’s hips as the younger man moaned appreciatively.

 

Dumbledore shook his head, as if trying to shake off the truth, which was hitting him in the face.

 

“Yes, you old fool. You might have discovered him and thrown him in Azkaban and managed to drive me to the brink of death… but we’re so much stronger than that. Seven years is nothing in the face of immortality,” Voldemort showed a shiny ring with a black gem in the middle, adorning the index finger of his left hand. Dumbledore’s eyes widened with horror upon the realization and he finally accepted his defeat. He hadn’t won when he threw Harry in Azkaban those years ago. He had already lost; he just didn’t know it yet.

 

“Now that we are reunited, Harry, my love, would you like to finally have your revenge on the old fool?” Voldemort spoke into Harry’s ear, the corners of his lipless mouth turning up in a twisted smile, which made Dumbledore shiver and struggle against his restraints. Harry purred happily at the close contact with his lover, but freed himself of the arms around him. 

 

“It’s useless, Dumbledore. You will pay for your idiocy tonight,” he said, walking up closer to the man. “You thought you could mould me for your twisted purposes, to be your perfect little weapon. All that accomplished was making me hate Muggles more and more every year you forced me to go back to that filthy place,” Harry leaned in so close that Dumbledore could see his own frightened, old face reflecting in those sparkling green orbs. “Voldemort is the best thing that has happened to me my whole life and since I turned away from you I’ve been happier than ever. Even Azkaban couldn’t break me,” his dirty teeth flashed in a grin. “Though admittedly, it wasn’t all ponies and rainbows. I wonder, have you ever actually been to Azkaban? Have you heard the hoarse screams in the darkest hour of the night as the Dementors suck out the very life from the only human being within close proximity? Then the screams stop and even when the soul has died, the sobbing and shaking of the body doesn’t cease. They sit there lifelessly, staring at you with empty, wide eyes, never moving,” his voice dropped to a mere whisper which for some reason sounded louder than a scream in the heavy silence of the room. “It’s terrifying,” Harry flashed him another insane grin and Dumbledore realized that Azkaban had only made the fearless monster within the young man stronger. He swallowed thickly, knowing he had made a terrible mistake, which would cost him his life.

 

“But enough of the small talk. You will die now. Say hi to Snape and the Dursleys in hell. Tell them that Harry sends his love,” he laughed at the top of his lungs and Voldemort joined in, showing his forked tongue with amusement. It doesn’t last long and Dumbledore knows his time is up.

Slashing his wand through the air in quick motions, Harry cuts the old man’s flesh, creating small patterns of bloody gashes. He giggles at the sigh and turns around to steal a chaste kiss from his lover’s lipless mouth, before turning back to Dumbledore, whose eyes were closed, his face wet with silent tears, his wrinkled hand forming fists as he braced himself against the pain in his whole body. But Harry was far from done. He didn’t spend seven years doing nothing. He had come up with a list of inventive and interesting curses he would cast on the man who had taken away his childhood. He boiled the blood in the man’s veins and burned the nerves in his skin. He twisted bones in and out of the broken body, amused by the cracking sounds of ribs breaking. His magic crackled around him happily as he poured more and more into the spells, breaking, slashing, burning.

 

“He’s dead, Harry,” Voldemort whispers in his ear, snapping Harry’s furious concentration.

 

“Oh…” he says ever-so-eloquently, staring at the mangled corpse in front of him. “I hope his wretched soul burns in hell, if such a place exists,” he says spitefully, not relinquishing the tight hold on his wand.

 

“I thought we’ve already agreed that Muggle beliefs are stupid and pointless,” Voldemort chuckles, circling around his lover predatorily. Harry growls.

 

“And yet I hope he suffers for all eternity and more.”

 

“I understand, he screwed with my life almost as much as he had with yours,” Voldemort steps up close to him, their noses mere centimetres apart. Harry’s breath is shallow and he leans into his lover’s chest, waves of tiredness and pain washing over his whole body. Azkaban hadn’t broken his mind, but it broke his body. He knows he is deathly thin, the joints and bones in his whole body hurt and even breathing involves a lot of effort. He had almost forgotten about it when he got carried away, all his concentration"
"of time which he spent being a lazy slob he had always been. She probably had to do everything around the house as well as actually looking after the children.

 

He spotted Ginny in the crowd as well. She looked to be holding up a lot better than his other two friends. Being a very intelligent and much more bearable version of Ron, she was working as an Auror. The Auror office had ceased hunting all Dark wizards and was now used as a force to fight crime in general. It had been a very stupid misconception that only Dark wizard and Slytherins committed crimes and Harry was very glad to see it gone and the society put on the right path once again. Ginny seemed to be accompanying Luna Lovegood, who was wearing a big necklace made from walnuts, but otherwise seemed a lot more grounded to reality than he had last seen her. A small smile tugged at the corners of his lips – he had always liked the blonde Ravenclaw, who had accepted him even when she knew he was working with Voldemort. She didn’t support either side in the war and went by mainly ignoring politics. Seeing her with Ginny – he had guessed that they had returned to their relationship from school years. They had been going out for some time at Hogwarts, but then Ginny dated some boys for a few years, but never seriously. He was glad for the two of them to have a happy relationship. He didn’t have anything against Ginny or Luna and would gladly leave them alone, unless they interfered. 


 


He saw many more of his old acquaintances, friends and enemies, mingling and making small talk politely. He didn’t care about any of them though, so he wasn’t about to seek them out. Instead he sought out his lover, finding himself immensely bored.  Political parties weren’t really his thing. They were Voldemort’s thing. He danced among politicians with appealing words, wrapping them all around his little finger without them even knowing they had been manipulated. He made it look like child’s play.

 

He was speaking with some plain-looking but very old wizard with merely patches of gray hair when Harry approached him and gently nudged his elbow with his hand, standing close to whisper, “Let’s stir things up a bit.” Voldemort caught on instantly, even if he didn’t know what Harry had planned for the night.

 

“Mr. Ogden, allow me to introduce to you my partner, Harry Potter,” Voldemort said with pretence of politeness, but his eyes told a different story, looking smug and full of cruel amusement. It took Harry a moment to recall where he had heard the man’s name before…ah! He was one of Dumbledore’s oldest friends and supporters. His lips curled up into a smirk at the look of betrayal, shock and hurt in the old wizard’s eyes.

 

Mr. Ogden gasped, his eyes widening almost comically and he stood there, gaping at the two wizards in dumbfounded silence.

 

“Harry Potter… impossible!” he finally managed to get out, his shocked expression replaced by anger. Witches and wizards around them fell silent suddenly, everyone’s eyes snapping to the young wizard by their Minister’s side.

 

Harry grinned mischievously, moving his hair to the side to reveal the lighting bolt scar on his forehead.

 

“Hello Ladies and Gentlemen,” he drawled, letting his hair fall back down loosely.

 

“Harry Potter?!” a yell was heard from somewhere deep in the crowd and a few seconds later Ron and Hermione had emerged into the small empty space that had formed around Voldemort and Harry. The redhead still had crumbs all over his face.

 

Harry rolled his eyes. “Are you that shocked to see me? I’d thought that by now you would have learned that the Boy-Who-Lived simply doesn’t disappear and die.”

 

Hermione looked bewildered, while Ron went completely red with rage on his face, looking like a dried up tomato.

 

“You filthy traitor!” he bellowed at Harry, whipping out his wand without thinking. Too bad for him that the Ministry had been mostly converted to Voldemort’s followers, either out of fear or being smart enough to see that things really had improved since the Ministry had been rebuilt. Before Ron could even cast a spell, a dozen Aurors in the crowd had their wands trained on him, Ginny included. The man sent his sister a look of utmost betrayal, but she didn’t even bat an eyelash at the insults he shouted at her. Hermione had taken out her wand too, looking rather desperate, trying to shield her useless husband a bit. It wasn’t the cleverest thing to do, Harry mused. She could have got away unharmed, but it was too late now that she had pointed her wand at him.

 

“You’re under arrest for attempted assault on the Minister and Harry Potter,” one of the Aurors said. It was a tough-looking man who Harry recognised as one of Voldemort’s supporters.

 

Hermione and Ron moved to resist, but the Aurors were trained to capture people. In the blink of"
"Draco was always so good at distracting him when he was stressed out and worried about something. Draco was amazing at keeping him calm and relaxed.

Of course, that didn’t really help when Draco was the one he was stressed and worried about. Why did Ron and Hermione have to go on their second honeymoon now?

He stood up, paced the corridor a few times, and sat back down.

Damnit. He could really use a smoke.

He eyed the the earth he’d stuck his cigarette into and shrugged. He relit it with his wand and sat back, his head bending in a weird angle against the wall. Those chairs were really the most uncomfortable chairs he’d ever sat on––save for that hard, wooden chair Professor Snape used to have in his office. Maybe he should donate some chairs to St. Mungo’s, or suggest the chairs should be excluded from the ‘No Transfigurations’ policy rigidly enforced with Wards.

Harry uselessly shifted on the chair to get more comfortable, and closed his eyes as he took another drag of his smoke. Come on, Draco!

“Mr. Potter?”

Harry jumped to his feet, hid the smoke behind his back, and turned his head to look at the man who had spoken up. Fuck, crimson robes, not lime green.

“Malfoy,” Harry said, sneering a little when the Auror made a dismissive gesture with his hand.

“Yes, I’m Robert Dawes. The Ministry has been contacted by St. Mungo’s due to the nature of Mr. Malfoy’s injuries. Can you enlighten me as to what happened?”

“I-I’m not sure,” Harry replied, tossing the unfinished cigarette back into the pot. “All I know is they attacked him. It all happened so fast.”

Shoving his slightly shaking hands in his pockets, Harry raised his shoulders and caught sight of his bloodied shirt. He looked up at the Auror who was eyeing him expectantly. “I only stepped into Flourish and Blotts for a moment without him, he said and sighed. ""I mean, you don’t pick up gifts for someone when they’re standing right beside you, do you?”

Dawes nodded for Harry to continue as his quill made a scratching noise against a piece of parchment floating besides his head.

“Well, as I said, I was only inside for a moment."" Harry removed his hands from his pockets and rubbed his left wrist over his right under arm. ""When I noticed the commotion, I ran outside, and h-.""

Fuck. There had been so much blood. And Draco's wing, and-.

He took a deep breath and crossed his arms over his chest, grabbing his shoulders and lowering his eyes. “He was just laying there, broken. Do you know how much force it takes? To take down a Veela?”

Dawes hummed in understanding. “Did you see any of the attackers, Mr. Potter?”

“Malfoy. Honestly, how hard can it be to remember?” Harry mumbled and sat back down, a shiver running down his back.

Dawes flushed lightly, but his gaze never lost its determination.

“No,” Harry replied to his question. “I was a little too preoccupied with my bleeding husband to look around and see who was there."" After a short silence he added: ""He must’ve fought back, so there’s bound to be some injuries.”

“Mr. Potter?” a woman asked.

Harry flicked his eyes to the ceiling and threw up his hands. “Yes?” he growled.

“Mr. Malfoy is out of surgery.”

Harry snapped his head around and breathed a sigh of relief at the Healer’s comforting smile. “How is he?” he asked, completely forgetting about the Auror that was still there.

“He’s fine, Mr. Potter,” the Healer said. Harry couldn’t give a rat’s arse about the name at that moment; Draco was going to be okay. “We’ve managed to reattach the left wing, and he should regain full use of it. The other wing will require some therapy, for we had to heal 62 individual breaks. But overall, Mr. Malfoy was very lucky.”

Harry huffed. Yes, very lucky to have been attacked in broad daylight in the middle of a bleeding shopping street. “Can I see him?”

The Healer smiled. “They are moving him to a private room right now. A mediwitch will come to take you to him when he’s settled.”

“Mr. Potter?”

Harry turned with a sigh and looked at the Auror.

“I’d like to speak with Mr. Malfoy about the attack if possible,” Dawes said, but the Healer interrupted before Harry could reply.

“Mr. Malfoy won’t be conscious for a while. Come back tomorrow afternoon and we’ll see if he’s ready to talk.”

Harry gave her a relieved smile and missed the stone-faced nod the Auror gave her behind Harry’s back before he turned on his heels and left.

Twenty long"
"I rasp, and I can actually hear the tiredness in my tone.

“Miss Granger.”

Fuck.

“Password.”

There’s a sigh.  “Miss Granger, you know very well that if I were here to kill you, I’d-“

“Password.”

“Miss Granger-“

“Say the goddamned password!” I shriek, and there’s silence in the aftermath, as echoes ring around the room.

This time, the sigh is one of resigned acceptance.  “It’s my fault they died.”

It bloody well is, you son of a bitch, I think, swallowing heavily, leaning back to open the door.

~~~~~


I pour boiling water into my cracked mug, trying not to wince as some of the liquid splatters (as it does, always, and I’d buy a new kettle or pour more slowly but there’s something real about the pain) on my skin.  “Tea?”  I ask, already reaching for another mug.

“It’s happening tomorrow,” he says grimly, in lieu of actually responding to my question, though he does lean forwards from the old, musty couch he’s seated on to take the mug I hand to him.

Not unexpected news; perhaps it’s what I’ve been counting down to, I suppose.  “Alright,” I shrug.

Maybe something in my tone – the apathy, the absolute lack of I care – surprises him, because he looks up sharply with what seems uncomfortably like disappointment in his eyes.

“Alright,” he echoes.

I blame the not-really-long long day for the fact that, barely ten minutes into the silence, I begin shifting uncomfortably in my seat (a wooden-backed, un-cushioned chair that is the only luxury, other than my bed, I’ll afford myself when it comes to rest.)

Surprisingly though, it’s he who breaks the silence first.  “How are you?”

A humourless laugh escapes me before I can stop it.  “I’m fine” (lie), “just fine.  The business is good, patients are tolerable-“

“I didn’t ask,” he cuts me off quietly, “how Melody Sawyers is.  How are you, Miss Granger?”

I sip my tea, though it’s already cooling.  “Don’t call me that,” I murmur.

A smile curves his lips (but doesn’t reach his eyes, it never reaches his eyes) and he shakes his head.  “Really, Miss Granger, it’s your name.”  I don’t respond, though the way he accentuates every syllable of my – that – name grates against my nerves like little else can, now.  “You can’t let that go so easily,” he continues, obviously undeterred by my silence.  “Just like you can’t let them go.”

It’s entirely possible that the sound of something shattering is the mug when I place it deliberately on the table.

I can deal with that later, I promise myself vaguely as I rise to my feet, striding towards him with my fists clenched.

“What, Professor,” he flinches at that, good, “you mean the way you let them go when you let them die?”

He doesn’t look at me, just sets his tea down on the table softly, licking his lips slightly.

(My eye doesn’t follow the movement of his tongue.  It doesn’t.)

“Perhaps,” he allows, shoulders moving slightly.  “Perhaps not.”

“Fuck.  You.  Professor.  Snape.”

His reply is smothered by the crush of my lips against his.

~~~~~

Somehow, we find ourselves where we always have, ever since everything fell to ruination and I ran, became Melody Sawyers with a dental degree I never started and a practice I never worked in, much less cofounded.

With his head between my legs; my fingers tangled in his hair, pulling and twisting; with the same words dripping from my lips in an incoherent snarl of language and grief and oh Merlin the pain.

“It’s your fault they died,” I hiss.  There’s a muffled sound of what is probably agreement, but it’s not enough; and so I wrench his head back with one hand, the other grasping at his chin and forcing his dark, unfathomable eyes to meet mine.

“Say it.”  The words are barely audible, a breath, and yet he hears.

(Or at least, he knows.  He always knows.)

“It’s my fault they died.”

Staring into that gaze, black and striking and real, that’s the first time I realise he believes it, really believes it.

Slowly, my fingers untangle from the back of his head as I release his chin (though the warmth of his skin lingers against mine.)  Still meeting my eyes, he bends his head back down, almost tentatively.

I nod, blinking back what must be dust in my eyes, before giving up and shutting them completely under the force of bittersweet pain-pleasure that wracks my body.

“Harry,"
"or even worse, accept them) – and you’d follow.

You’ll follow him into death if need be.

Tom Riddle, you think, sounding out the name in your head.

He glances at you, pinning you with his gaze, and you freeze in your seat.

He smiles slightly, still staring directly at you, before looking away and continuing to speak, though you don’t hear what he’s saying.

You don’t need to.

 


II.


Tom Riddle.

 He fucks you the same way he speaks, the way he does everything.  It’s torturously slow, almost clinical, but underscored by a raging heat that dominates and sets your nerves on fire.

“Tom,” you gasp out when you come, and you’re so dazed that you barely feel him freeze inside of you.

Later, as you’re running fingers over his pale skin, he says quietly, “’Tom’ was my father’s name.  A common, disgusting Muggle name.”

Muggle?  “You’re a half-blood?” and it’s so hard to conceal your tone of disgust, but you think you manage.  It’s impossible, that this man, teeming with power and nobility, could ever be so base.

In one fluid movement, he’s hovering over you, hands to your neck; you choke, gasping desperately for air.

“I might look like him,” he hisses coldly (but his rage is burning and it’s so deliciously painful, you can’t help but want more of it), “but I am Salazar’s heir.  Don’t forget it.”

 


III.



Voldemort.



Lord Voldemort.


Death has never frightened you, but he is your Lord (your master your lover) so you don’t tell him that you preferred the name Tom.

Tom is a lover’s name, Voldemort a master’s.

He still fucks you, but doesn’t stay afterwards; he doesn’t linger in bed, doesn’t let you touch his skin (that’s getting paler and paler even as his eyes lose their incongruous soft brown to what looks disconcertingly like the colour of Gryffindor rubies).

But he still spends time with you, still smiles approvingly when you come up with a new idea to convert the stupid sheep that make up the Wizarding world.

Anything for that.

 


IV.


You don’t start off finding happiness in suffering.  Oh, Andromeda (blood traitor whore but always a Black, always your sister) and Cissy might talk about you killing animals; but never for the pain.  You’re curious – how much blood lost before it’s too much, what the inside of a cat looks like.

They didn’t understand, but your Lord does; he recognises where your talents lie, gives you purpose where nothing else has.  He’s your guiding light, through obsequious Ministry officials wanting nothing more than to be seen with you to raise their miserable social statuses.

 


V.


You don’t find happiness in suffering but you laugh when the Longbottoms scream.  You wish their son was here, their little newborn baby that’s off with his grandmother (not that you’re worrying about that, because the next miserable life on your list is Augusta Longbottom).  You want to tear them apart then put them back together, want to find a way to make sure they die over and over till he comes back and then you’ll kill all these blood traitors together, you and him.

 


VI.


Azkaban makes you crazy, perhaps.

But you’ve been insane since you met him.

And that will never change, you vow, as Dementors steal everything from you that made you want to live (everything but him, nothing can take that, and so when you’re rocking backwards and forwards on your pile of straw, you don’t think about your sisters what sisters only him)

Only him.

 


VII.


It’s the happiest day of your life when you realise you’re going to see him again.


And then you do.


He’s not who (what) you remember (no fire just ice, cold and harsh and unforgiving and he was all of those but so much more and you can’t bring yourself to think that-)

But you’re not what you remember, either.

 


VIII.


Bella.  He still calls you Bella, even if his voice is cold and affectionless, even if he doesn’t smile at you like he used to, even if he doesn’t order you to join him in bed.  He trusts you, even if he doesn’t love you (never loved you), even if he doesn’t want you.

Azkaban has ruined you for him, but nothing can ruin him for you.


Only him.


 


IX.


Your spirit lingers, resisting Death’s call and the choice you have to make.  You see his anger when you fall and something in you smiles. 

When Potter strikes him down, when his body falls broken to the ground, you wait.

Nothing rises from the"
"wand.""

Huh. That was unexpected, but Draco did all the same -- twelve inches, heart pine, unicorn hair core, an adequate replacement for his first wand. His hand shook unexpectedly as he did so, because the sight of it was so out of place in that smaller grasp. ""Yes, Professor.""

It had been years, and years, and Severus snatched it from his fingers, a warm brush of fingers against fingers. ""Now, stand up and lean over the desk.""

Licking his lips, he looked at Severus, brows knitting together. ""Lean over the desk, sir?""

""Lean over the desk, Mr. Malfoy."" So simple, but Draco felt thrilled, because it had never happened to him before when he'd actually been that age. Severus had lurked and called him into his office and talked and given him treats pulled out of a drawer. Never told him to bend over a desk the better to present his ass.

He swallowed in an attempt to seem reluctant and then obediently spread himself over the top of the thing. His toes barely touched the floor when he leaned over it, and it tightened his trousers across his bottom and around his thighs. ""Y-yes, Professor.""

Fingers pinched his ass after a moment, and he heard Severus sigh. ""So lovely. It won't take long to warm up something this pert.""

Warm up? Oh, that hadn't been in the plan at all, at least not to his way of thinking, and a shiver of shock rippled through him, his head jerking around to look back at Severus with wide gaze. ""S-sir?""

""You don't think your punishment is just that I stand behind here feeling you like an orange?"" He lifted an eyebrow at Draco, and the coldness in his eyes cut Draco to the bone. It made him breathe in sharply and tremble, awash with a flood of strange hormones that he hadn't felt since he'd been much younger.

Somehow, he managed to swallow. ""No, Professor.""

""Just as well."" He was surprised when he felt Severus reach underneath of him, unfastening his trousers beneath which he had nothing but skin. ""Hitch up your robe.""

There was no stopping the whimper that brooked from him, but it didn't affect his ability to obey. God, it was dirty. He'd had fantasies like this, found it difficult to rise and walk out of Severus's classroom, been so grateful that they all wore robes and he never had to worry about anyone catching him walking around hard after potions class. His fingers scrabbled, tugged at the material, pulling until it was situated across the small of his back in a bunch.

Robes up and trousers down, up on his toes with the table pressed hard against his belly. Severus sighed, and stretched his fingers over his ass. ""Lovely. Perfect, pert.""

Oh god. Merlin, but he was hard, his dick rubbing against the desk, and Draco whimpered again and snuck a glance back over his shoulder helplessly. ""Sir.""

""You never admire yourself in a mirror?"" He was smiling at Draco before he landed the first hard smack against one cheek.

Oh. Oh. He panted after that first strike, body shivering in reaction. ""Professor!"" Of course he admired himself, endlessly. He'd love to have mirrors in their bedroom so that he could see himself riding Severus's cock, and more than anything, he wished for mirrors now so that he could see himself young and innocent and being punished for some imaginary infraction.

It was something he could ask for another time. ""You're not nearly sorry."" Another hard stinging smack to the other cheek. He couldn't help pushing his hips forward for that delicious contact, or the way that he rubbed his face against his arm and whined. No, he wasn't sorry at all. He wouldn't have been sorry back then, either.

He wouldn't have gotten two more hard smacks, and then the point of a wand pressed against his asshole and a quietly whispered spell.

It was so good that things had changed.

Somehow, he managed a wrenching sob and something like a struggle, never mind how much he wanted it. ""Professor! Please!"" Please, please, please. Please more, please now, please hard. Another firm pinch at his ass, and Draco was nearly humping the table before he felt Severus come up behind him, felt the brush of fabric against his thighs. ""Professor, I don't think this is any sort of approved punishment..."" His voice was thin and high-pitched, sounding almost afraid where it was stretched thin with desire.

""No it is not. Not that the approved punishments are better."" He felt Severus pushing against him, and he inhaled sharply at the sudden pressure, shaking in a way he hadn't in... a very long time. The tension of it was hard, and it felt so much bigger than normal; not that Severus was in any"
"Wildas Haim blinked twice, lifted his hand to massage his temples, and promptly fell over.

After a couple minutes, he regained conciousness, and promptly vomited. A few minutes after that, he had regained his bearings, Vanished the mess he had made, and dusted off his cloak. The Transition always did that to him - not entirely a rare side-effect of the experience, but still one that was rather unfairly linked to the inexperienced and inept. Wildas was neither, and the top brass knew it. That was why he had been specially selected for this mission, which was not just the most dangeous mission he had ever attempted, but quite possibly the most dangerous mission attempted by any wizard in his century. Not only was he traveling back to the First Potter War, not only was this nowhere near his first time doing so, and not only was he going to be within mere feet of a previous version of himself, a couple years and a Hippogriff-load of missions back, but he was going to do so under his real name.

While no one had been tactless enough to explicitly say it out loud, it had been made abundantly clear that this was to be Wildas' last mission in this era, if not his last mission, period. Wildas hadn't balked at this - it was all part of the job, and he knew exactly what he was getting into when he signed up for the Department so many, many years ago. As he stumbled out of the closet in the small empty flat off Knockturn Alley that was always rented out but no one knew exactly to whom, Wildas winced at a small twinge in his knee. It wasn't a big deal, but it was yet another indication that he was slowly approaching the age of ""Too Blasted Old For This"". He stalked over to the mirror in the gloomy hallway and took out his wand. He reflected on how ironic it was that now that he was starting to get to the point that he no longer had to Transfigure his hair into the trademark wiry gray of his now-retired persona, that persona was, well, now-retired. He murmured and fussed, jabbing his face here and there with his wand, until he was satisfied with his work.

A man with cloudy gray eyes, neatly shorn blonde hair, and only a slight hint of wrinkles on his conventionally attractive, but not entirely memorable face, stepped out of a flat onto a sidestreet of Knockturn Alley. He briskly walked past crooning crones and wizened wizards hawking wares of dubious quality and even more dubious intent. He had to move quickly, both metaphorically speaking in regards to the plan, and literally so, because something about the smell of Knockturn Alley always got to him. It wasn't strong enough to be categorized as a stench, but there was definitely a smell to that place that was markedly different than that of Diagon Alley, and it was not one that Wildas Haim liked, thank you very much. Besides, while newbies to the side of the Dark Arts always thought it a clever idea to start looking for leads in the place nationally recognized for being a home of illict wizardry, Wildas knew you had to look elsewhere if you wanted real connections. Of course, anyone with any real brains knew that the Ministry of Magic was implicit in the continuining existence and allure of Knockturn Alley, favoring the devil they knew and got bribes from over the one they didn't. 

The warm spring air lifted Wildas' spirits as he stepped onto Diagon Alley and began to head for the passage to Muggle London. It was May 1997, Dumbledore was still alive, Scrimgeour was still growling about the Minister's office, and Ministry had not yet fallen. Those lowest in the pecking order of his organization (but still high enough to know of his mission's existence) knew that his mission was to make sure that the fall of the Ministry happened differently. Those at the top of the pecking order knew that his true mission was to make sure that it didn't fall at all. But only Wildas and the Council of Five (who were so far up on that pecking order that almost no one below them even knew they existed) knew that his true, true mission was indeed to make sure that the Ministry fall happened differently, but in a way no one would ever expect, or be prepared for.

Wildas Haim was no longer going to change history. He was going to make it."
"shoulder, he brought it back down with a snarl that exposed yellowed-and-brown canines within nearly lip-less maws, and more than one visualized the enemy that was responsible for their Head's choice - or their own downfall and eventual capture.

For generations, after all, the Nest of Peruvian Viperteeth had played host to the leaders of failed uprisings, whole Clans' kin that had been conquered, or ignoble and untrustworthy members of their society on an individual basis.

Stationed beneath the illustrious eye of Gringotts Bank, they toiled and tolled away for the life of their loan to the Nest, and in return for keeping their undesirable brethren from rampaging through the world, a simple charge of interest was applied on behalf of the Clans' involved - the delivery of worthy titles, deeds to lands desired, and old smith-work long overdue all given over to the Bank's holding.

For many and for the better part of the centuries since its implementation, it was a trade well-viewed by their society.

But for many more into the recent times, it had been a constant Devil's Snare in their ancestral vaults, dragging more and more luxuries away from the victors of each successive uprising.

Only thrice had the goblin society failed to uphold their payments, and only thrice in the history of the Nest had the inhabitants been rallied toward war as a result.

While wizard-kind saw only further goblin anarchy and inter-racial wars, the Nest reminded the rest of their people of why it existed, and why they - and the Bank - would not be ignored.

No one beneath the ground or tending to the affairs of wizards above it would ever breath a word of the Nest's existence to the other races until equality was finally met, and magic shared in equal measure at last.

The pounding that tedious night ceased immediately within three tiers as it was overpowered by a shrill whistle, and from the yawning vertical gap down the middle of the passageways, the Feeder slid down on an ancient chain reenforced with runes.

""Dinnertime, you heaping cur's! Sit down and open up!"" his voice echoed up and down each row as he spun in place, and he produced an Ever-Contracting Spear from a pouch belted to his waist.

The copper tool glistened with a rudimentary shish kabob along its length, scraps of muscle, marrow, and a white-gray goo that was meant to aide in swallowing.

The mass of food was proven to be considerably thinner than it had at first appeared after the spear performed its function, however, shooting forward and pinning the slanted point into the eastern wall firmly.

Despite being reduced to at-most three bites per goblin, they still fell upon it like a murder of taunted crows. Fingers pinched and pulled and scraped at it, eroded incisors bit hard into the cool metal beneath, and with those who actually had proper strength available, a new set of scratches marred the surface of the haft when they were done.

The Feeder shook his end after mere seconds, dislodging any last-gnawers, and the tool retracted back into a more manageable length as he turned about and dipped it into the pouch to repeat the process for the other three rows around him.

The last slave at the far end of the eastern row, still licking his chops irritably, fingered the pickaxe's point as he eyed the Feeder.

His tendons itched to leap and drive a blow that would kill the employee, to take into his own hands a weapon once again and then press its lovely tip straight into the magical eye spiraling around within the Watcher's skull when he descended like the carrion-spit he was to survey them again.

He longed for the time now far past when he had heralded fresh blood spilt out of the enemies throat across virgin soil, and taken first pick of the spoils of war thereafter.

It was a thought commonly shared by the others in the nearby tiers. And like those others, he swallowed his bloodlust with a final lap of his pitted tongue across the stubs of his teeth, scraping up the very last drop of goop clinging to the gums.

Once the Feeder dropped down and out of sight only seconds later, another rusted chain appeared as the Watcher descended from above.

Whereas the Feeder was merely ugly in the traditional sense, with the blood of a house elf only two sires back, he at least had the grace to cover up his oddities behind a cowl and veil.

The Watcher did not.

Smoother, human-tainted ears, an softer nose, and that despicable wizard-crafted blue eye rushing about in every direction were all displayed, and it was boasted of loudly and often that the cat o' nine tails strapped to its' precious belt contained the remnants of a broken wand inside of the device.

Gray hair hung from the ears and met around the back of the head to keep it well away from the eyes, and the brown-red of the remaining natural pupil stared defiantly down each row as he examined them for hints of mutiny.

He couldn't even deign to wear natural goblin-crafted clothing or armor, foregoing it in favor"
"still empty. The silence was soothing; it washed away the clinging stares of strangers from school. The dishes were done quickly and the water in the pan was already heating up. The peacefulness likely would not last much longer, but for now, Harry could sit down and rest, just a little. Looking out of the kitchen window into the garden, he let his thoughts drift. Once, he would have been able to colour the world however he liked – see people who were kind to him and played with him. That was a long time ago, though… before the incident with the letters. It had caused his Uncle to shut him in the cupboard for nearly two months; until they needed him to cook the meals and tidy the house again. Since then, he had stopped imagining – it only ever got him into trouble.


“Some call him a ghost; some say that he is a demon. Some call him a mere mortal…”*3


The passage from the exam was still slowly boring through his mind. The words seemed to echo in his thoughts endlessly.

The red eyes blinked at him curiously.

“Ah, there is it again…” Harry thought, slowly waking from his reverie.

The eyes did not vanish this time, instead glowing mysteriously amidst the shadows of the trees outside. How strange, Harry’s muddled mind supplied slowly. The eyes disappeared again. Harry shot out of his seat suddenly, wide awake. What the hell had just happened? He ran quickly to look out of the window, where he had just seen the flash of red. Nothing was there.

He was almost disappointed. With himself. He had abandoned delusions of the supernatural, but yet his mind insisted on playing such cruel tricks.

The glass was cool against his nose and steam had built up on the lenses of his cracked glasses. Tears were just barely pricking at the corners of his eyes. How pathetic.

He was ready to return to his chores, he just needed a small break. Just a moment, to rid himself of such treacherous thoughts… when suddenly he noticed a man standing in the light of the streetlamp outside. His face was veiled in shadow, but the eyes… they were unmistakeably, definitely blood red. Mesmerizing….

He found his body moving on his own. Like a homing beacon in Dudley’s sci fi games, the man simply drew Harry to him. He walked out of the house and quickly up to the man – tall, thin and intimidating. His body was cold and trembling. He’d forgot to put slippers or shoes on…

“We meet at last, Harry Potter…” the man whispered. His voice was low, almost raspy, but soothing to the ears. “Sixteen years, Harry... and yet it feels as though it was only… yesterday.”

“What?” Harry choked out, paralyzed by the intense stare which held such immeasurable power.

“It is regrettable, but reasonable that you would not remember me, Harry. Forgive my rudeness,” the stranger bowed rigidly, only enough to be polite. “I am Lord Voldemort, the Lord of all Darkness and I have come to take you away from here.”

Harry’s mind was jumping in loops, unable to comprehend the sheer weirdness of the man in front of him. His uncle had always punished him for ‘associating with that kind of people’. Fear run rampant in his mind, paralyzing all thought.

“Do not worry. I shall never harm you,” the man reassured him with a smile. A cold, lifeless smile. “Unless you try to break our contract, of course…”

“Contract?” Harry echoed in disbelief. “What do you mean? Who are you?!”

“I was the one who saved your life, fifteen years ago, when your parents were killed – in return for taking you as mine.”

“Liar! My parents died in a car accident!” Harry took a step back, feeling cold, twisting dread coil in his stomach.

“Did they now…. Then why didn’t you? Why do you heal so easily and re-grow hair much faster than an average human?” Voldemort laughed, not affected by Harry’s accusations. “The truth is right… here…” he grasped Harry’s wrist roughly, too fast for him to react. A long, thin finger traced the exposed, purple veins on Harry’s skin.  “That’s right… it flows in your blood.

“My poison….”

Harry pulled, tried to get away, but the hold on his arm was far too strong to fight.

“It returned you to life that night and bound you to me for eternity. It waited, strengthening your power day by day, slowly but surely… And now, the wait is finally over.”

Rows of sharp, long teeth sank into his wrist without warning. The rush of blood overwhelmed him and the world started spinning. The beating of his heart, suddenly so loud and clear, slowed down erratically, making him cough and gasp, as his body grew hot and his throat constricted with an unknown hunger.

“That night,"
"cave entrance, swirling, false wind bringing with it tired limbs, warm-safe-hollow, let head sag just so, eyes fall closed.  She fights it, claws piercing rock, the hard slap of her wings against the cave wall, her tail thrashing.  Fire swells up her throat and curls against the roof of her mouth before streaming out in a wild burst.  She follows the fire, does not fear what is hers to own, will not let these heart-of-dragons near her young, her fire and ash to be.

Her head clears the cave, bursting through the lingering swell of fire.  She shrieks at the sight of the interlopers, a high, keening knife of sound that leaves the air humming where it touches her scales.  She lunges for the closest, a flash of color, the bitter sweet scent of magic and prey.

Pain explodes in her eyes, the suddenness of it snapping her head around, wings slapping the air.  Her tail whips around and smashes through rock.  Something screams and the scent of fresh blood is heavy, warm, draws her lips back from her teeth in a satisfied hiss in spite of the pain.

She cannot see but she can smell them, hear their strange calls as they scurry around her.  More flame pours from her mouth, her eyes throbbing, making her twist and thrash as she tries to escape, to get away but also to hurt, to protect the mouth of the cave tucked behind her.  The air swells, heavy and thick with magic yet to come, her flaming snarl spilling sulfur and brimstone until there is nothing beyond pain, heat, fear, rage.

She is hit from all sides, explosions of power that are nothing like the clash of scales, no teeth or claws to fight, wings fluttering helplessly.  The world fades as she falls, a high whine building as the fire dies in her throat.

When she wakes the pain is gone, replaced with a cold that seeps between her scales, licks at the fire of her heart.  She smells the bitter-sharp brimstone and flame of other dragons, hears their roars and shrieks, is helpless to do anything but answer them.  She snarls at them, the closest sun on rolling hills of green scales, pulls at that which holds her, sharp clicks that rest so very cold against her scales.  Bitter salt on flowers are everywhere, crawling, soft creatures that watch her, smelling of magic and fear. 

The others are dams-to-be, dull scent of fire and ash to be muted by the shell lingering between them all.  They shriek and call, want their young, to escape the cold.  She claws the ground, pulls and thrashes, high keens that split the cold and send the bitter salt on flowers scurrying about her.  She wants her young, can smell the dry curve of their shells if she lifts her head just so.  They are close, so close but she cannot find them, cannot reach them.  Sun on rolling hills of green snarls at her, and she snarls back, tail whipping around to puncture soft dirt with her spikes. 

Too many dams-to-be, poachers, death-bringers who do not want to share the world with her fire and ash to be.  She wants to tear at their scales, drive them from this place of everlasting cold, protect her young if only she can find them.  The crawling, chirping heart-of-dragons gather around her twisting, shrieking form, gathering power around them.  She lunges but is brought up short, can only roar defiance as she is once more brought low, the cold dirt pressing against the thin scales along her jaw.

When she wakes the scent of bitter salt on flowers is overwhelming, a low thunder of noise coming from all directions.  It makes her spines bristle, wings stretching as she rises, but before she stands she stops, a low croon of surprise as she smells the dry curve of fire and ash to be.  She sweeps her head over the eggs, humming as she counts, each one dry and sharp but different, settles back into place when she finds none missing.  There is one that is cold, not one of her fire and ash to be that she pushes away from the others, hisses at it before dismissing it. 

She hisses at the endless roar of sound, flame curling at the edges of her teeth when another scent catches her attention.  Slewing her head around she sniffs the ground near her eggs, snarls when she smells other dragons.  She moans, a low sound of pain, fear, terror, jerks her head back from the scent of fire and ash to be exposed to the world before time was right, the cloying scent of death. 

She curls tighter around her young, wings pressed tight to her back, spiked tail pushing her eggs closer to the soft heat of her belly.  Bitter salt on flowers are all around, there is no where she can go, something heavy fastened around her neck, bruising the scales beneath her chin and crest of spines.  She cannot fight, her searing breath will not reach from where she is crouched amongst them"
"'m fine..can we just go inside?"" He asked. ""Stop caring about me...I'm nothing...stop being so nice."" Fred nodded and Dragged Theo in, George followed as Theo sighed in relief at the heat. He was still coughing but not as bad. George Kept looking at Him with a worried look. ""I'm fine."" Theo reassured as they Dragged him to the kitchen, Theo couldn't help but notice How messy and friendly the house was. ""Mom!! He's here!"" Fred Yelled and Theo jumped a little from the sudden noise. Then he saw A woman with red hair looking at him with apron on. ""Oh Fred, George...is this your boyfriend, oh I heard so much about you!""She said. Theo blushed and stammered out ""Y-yeah.. nice t-to meet you."" He smiled shyly as he stood close to The twins as they both kissed his cheek. ""Oh that amazing! What's your name dear?"" She asked as The kitchen bexams more crowed as A bunch of other red heads flocked in, Theo could tell which one was Ron, he was the kid always with Harry, and Ginny, Rom's younger sister. Theo felt like a caged animal as The father, he could only tell cause he was the oldest looking patted his back and Theo cussed a little and Fred looked at him. There was way to much sound and movement going on for the Only son Of Samuel Nott and he tried not to scream. ""Dearie, what's your name?"" The Mom said- Molly...Theo knew she said her name he just couldn't remember when- as Every one looked at him. Theo Felt like his heart was gonna burst. ""They can tell who I am..they can see the scars.. they're gonna hate me"" Theo took a deep breath and said quietly ""Theodore Nott..."" At once he could feel the haterd shot at him, hitting him in the heart like a knife as He realized that He wouldn't be allowed to stag here. The kid with the glasses-Percy opened his mouth And before he could Fred said ""Mom is it okay If Theo goes to our room? He's pretty tired."" Molly took one look at him and nodded as Theo Grew pale. ""Stop it...they hate me.... just leave me."" Theo thought As George Led him to his room keeping his arm wrapped around Theo's waist. He opened their bedroom door and Theo sat on the bed and Groaned. ""They hate me...."" he said. George Shook is head. ""That's not it... they just... ya know?"" Theo looked at Him and said ""yeah they hate me... and it seems like they can see right through me..."" George sat next to him and Pulled him close As Theo coughed. He could hear yelling from downstairs and Covered Theo's ears. Theo Closed his eyes and a shot time later Fred walked in. George Looked at him as He sat On the other side of Theo and kissed his brother. ""So I told them off,  I told them to show some respect."" He said calmly,George looked at him and nodded as he ran a hand though Theo's umber hair. ""Is he sleeping..?"" Fred Nodded and said ""I can see it."" George Looked at him as Fred pulled Theo's jacket away from his skinny frame and George then noticed the Brusie sticking out. His heart started to race as he looked at his brother, who looked Just as mad as He felt. ""This was the one place we wanted him to feel safe."" Fred sighed as George kissed Theo's head and Theo stirred and said ""I didn't do it."" Fred laughed and stood up. ""Come on guys."" George followed and Theo rubbed his eyes and then Fixed his jacket. Fred eyes were locked on him as Theo coughed again. He was starting to regret Tackling the boy in the snow...atfer all Theo got sick so easily. Fred and George grubbed one of their Small lover hands and pulled him down stairs laughing. ""Guys- don't pull- slow down!"" Theo yelped. He rolled his eyes and almost tripped but Fred Then threw him over his shoulder. Theo blushed and said ""H-hey!"" George Looked at him. ""Ya know Fred, he looks cute like this."" Fred smirked as he walked into The living room and Set Theo down, who Hid behind Him and George frowned. Percy didn't look happy and nor did Their father. ""So... Um...your sons are nice."" Theo said to make some sound. Arthur nodded and Theo coughed. ""Fred? Is He alright?"" Molly asked. ""Huh? Oh yeah Mom!"" George yelled back and they both snickered. Theo looked confused but didn't say anything as Fred Hugged him and put his chin on his head. Percy glared and Fred had enough. ""Percy stop glaring! Your just jealous our boyfriend could come over!"" He snapped and Percy rolled his eyes"
"be gone, and the softer, less offending light of the moon would illuminate the night. He was not, however, looking forward to entering the restaurant, because it was a Friday night in the summer, which meant a large amount of merry chatter. Hopefully one of his friends had made the dinner reservation and remembered to select a table outside where it wasn't quite so suffocating.

            You watched him apprehensively when the lock to your door didn't open. He made no move to get out of the car while he examined the parking lot closely to make sure that his friends' cars were indeed there, and it hadn't just been Mae and Sarah weaving silly little technology spells. After spotting all three cars, Corentin relaxed a little and unlocked his door.

 

            The car was a piece of shit for sure, you decided. No matter what you did, the door did not unlock. Heat rose to your cheeks in embarrassment as Corentin unlocked his door and exited with ease. So much for trying not to look like an idiot in front of him.

 

            Corentin smiled again as you became more frantic in your attempts at opening the door. He should have told you that it could only be unlocked with the key from the outside, even though it automatically locked when the car started, but he was enjoying the mounting fear and embarrassment that was beginning to roll off of you as you fidgeted with the lock while sitting in his car.

            You looked up at him when he stopped in front of the passenger door and inserted the key. The lock clicked and you nearly knocked him over in your haste to get out of the infernal muggle contraption.

            ""Should have told you it doesn't unlock without a key or spell,"" Corentin stated lazily as he locked the car. Your cheeks were flushed in embarrassment, and the fear that he would think you were an idiot boggled his mind when it hit him again. Why did you care so much what he thought about you?

            ""Oh,"" was all you could muster as you entered the restaurant. As predicted, the laughter from different tables hit him like a train as soon as the doors swung open.

            ""Are you okay?"" you asked, noticing the sudden change in expression on Corentin's face.

            ""Just a migraine,"" Corentin lied fluidly. It was such a practiced lie he almost believed what he said, himself.

            With no reason to distrust the answer, you helped him to a seat. ""Wait here while I find out where they're sitting."" You made sure he was in the chair before rushing off to find the group.

            When you returned, Corentin didn't think he could stand by himself anymore because of the pain. Why had his friends insisted upon dinner when they knew what an ordeal it was for him? After a month of solitude, he was not used to crowds anymore, especially not at mealtime, when they tended to be at their most jovial.

 

            ""They're sitting outside,"" you informed Corentin upon your return. You couldn't help but worry a little due to the intense look of pain on his face. ""Are you sure you don't want to just go home?""

            Corentin gave a weak laugh. ""I've made it this far already. I might as well stay for dinner, (Name)."" He stood and almost lost his balance. You could tell he was about to topple over when those purple eyes crossed. Rushing forward, you put one of his arms over your shoulder, and he instantly acquiesced to your help, leaning heavily on you as the pair of you made your way outside.

            Color coming to your cheeks again, you noticed just how warm Corentin's body was as he leaned on you. From his pale complexion, you'd assumed he'd have been fairly cold, especially considering how unsteady he was on his feet at the moment.

 

            As soon as you were outside, Corentin felt much better, and took most of his weight off of you. ""You didn't have to help me,"" he told the top of your head.

            ""Don't be silly. You were going to collapse. Of course I had to help you.""

            So there was a difference between you and the other girls; any one of them would have watched him fall to the floor writhing in agony, pointed, and laughed at him.

            ""Corey, my man! Not lookin' so hot,"" Zak said, coming to support him from the other side. ""And this must be the lovely (Name) I've heard so much about from my Miss Mae! Zak Shaw at your service señorita~!"" He grinned widely at you.

            ""Can we get him into a chair before we do introductions?"" you asked, glancing worriedly up at Corentin.

            Personally, Corentin thought Zak's antics were generally amusing and didn't find his laughter too painful to endure, but he was extremely grateful for your request.

            ""Sure, sure. Sorry about that dude, if we'd known how busy it was, we'd have picked a different spot.""

            Corentin shook"
"the smug bastard. He's been so...

“Infuriating,” Tom breathes, leaning closer to him.

“Exactly,” Harry agrees and gets up quickly, not sure if he can keep from doing something tremendously stupid himself.  “There's something I've been meaning to ask you, actually.”

Tom's annoyance seems to take a backseat for a moment and he waits a moment for Harry to speak.

“Where do you see me in five, ten years?” he asks calmly and the calculating look which used to be ever present in his eyes is back again. “You don't... need to answer that. I honestly don't think you'd even thought that far ahead, other than about what the world will be like with you on top. Maybe you vaguely expected me to follow you wherever you would go. I don't think I can do that, Tom. You manipulated me under your thumb back at school. I didn't have any goals in life, I didn't have anything that could keep my interest... and you exploited that to suit yourself. You almost made me forget that I don't have to go along with everything you do. I've recently realized that what I want...” 

Harry pauses for a moment and his hand travels to his robe pocket to take out the ring that he'd kept since he stole it from the Charms professor all those years ago. Tom's ring.

“...Doesn't matter,” he mutters and places the ring on the table and withdraws a little. “I hope you find what you're looking when you're king of the world.” He cracks a smile and leaves quickly, not looking back at Tom's no doubt dumbfounded face.

 *

He tries to feign indifference to the Death Eater's movements, staying locked up in the Potter-Black manor to work on his book on using martial arts and magic for self defence and duelling. The research is going slowly and he feels like the walls are slowly closing in around his desk, urging him to get out there and do something. It's an altogether unfamiliar feeling. Before Tom, before he got swept off his feet by the attention the genius wizard paid him, he never used to feel anything so acutely. Nothing seemed to matter in the long run, so he'd rarely developed interest in anyone, either. But then he'd picked up the trail of the rising Dark Lord and suddenly his world began to spin at full speed. The obsession quickly overshadowed everything else and he'd forgotten how to be himself, merely following along with Tom's ambitions. Being so young and impressionable, he completely fell for the impressive and compelling Dark Lord.

He doesn’t want to be just another follower. Even if he has some privileges, even if Tom occasionally lets his guard down around him, it’s not enough anymore. Is it really so bad, to want to stand by Tom's side as an equal? He doesn’t want to be recognised only for the kill count on raids and for being good in bed. He once had thought that Tom understood and that he wanted him too... before it slowly, surely became obvious that it had all just been a mind game, a challenge to overcome. So it’s better to leave, to forget and sit this one out quietly, not picking sides. 

All that was easier said than done, considering he had used his dad's Invisibility Cloak to sneak into the ministry and killed Crabbe to save Tom's ass. He could only pretend to be impartial, when really; he'd been on Tom's side all along, intentionally or not.

Finally, Hermione is the one who manages to drag him outside. They meet at their regular coffee shop in Muggle London and Harry really wishes he'd stayed at home. Refusing in the first place would have been easier, even though he prefers to avoid confrontation of any sort. So much for keeping to himself and out of emotional drama, he thinks sarcastically. First Tom, now Hermione wants something. He just knows she's onto something, there's that little spark in her eyes like there always had been each time she had learned something new at school. Why she hadn't left him be after graduation, he has no idea, but clearly, she had assumed they became friends at some point and now continues to self-appointedly 'look out for him'. Her insistent prying into his private life really isn't welcome right now.

“Hello Harry,” she says by way of usual greeting, but the feeling... somehow isn’t in it. She sits down opposite him, pulling one of the two steaming drinks towards her.

“Hi,” he returns also less than enthusiastically.

“There's something I need to talk to you about,” she pushes straight to the subject, as bossy as ever. No wonder she never had any real friends all the way through school.

“Have you finally got funding for your muggleborn tracking"
"I could use a little fun.”

Seamus toed off his worn trainers and curled his legs underneath him on the chair before continuing. “So we get to this club. Music’s thumping, lights are blinking. Looks fun, ya know. But there’s one thing I notice. No girls. Nope, not one bloomin’ bird in the whole place. Well you know what that meant dontcha?”

Dean just grinned.

“Yeah, you got it, mate. Gay club. Just a buncha shirtlifters. So now I’m a little annoyed with myself for not expecting that, but I figure what the heck, music’s good, I need a night out, so I grab a pint, find a piece of wall to lean on, and watch the scene.”

“How was it?” Dean asked, definitely interested in where this was going.

Seamus leaned in closer, letting his friend know they were getting to the best part of the story.

“Well it wasn’t so great at first; just a buncha half-dressed blokes sweating to the beat. So I had another pint while my mate hooked up with some pansies across the bar. Funny thing happened though, once I downed my third round, my feet started tapping and those boys up on that dance floor started looking a darn sight fitter.”

“So, did you dance?” Dean prodded. Honestly interested in Seamus’ tale.

“I was getting to that part. Don’t rush me.”

“Alright. Go on then.”

“Yeah, so I’m leaning against this wall, really starting to feel the music and the beer of course, and this bloke comes up and motions to the dance floor. I think, why not. Looks like it could be fun, so off we go.”

“And?” Dean said impatiently.

“And, you’re rushing me again, Dean.”

“Okay. Sorry,”

Dean sat back again and listened.

“We start to move. Ya know, getting into the beat. It’s amazing how it gets to you. All of a sudden it’s getting hot and this bloke is right there, rubbing against me in all the right places. I’m just going with it, not really thinking about anything but the sounds and the heat around me and then he starts kissing me.”

Dean’s eyes widened and he moved in closer to Seamus, feeling a little flushed himself all of a sudden. “Did you kiss him back?”

“What do you think, Dean? Yeah, I kissed him back. It was incredible. The heat, the feel of that lean muscle against my skin; it was intoxicating, and I don’t think it was the beer.”

“So what happened next?”

“Do you really wanna know?”

Dean’s knees were practically touching Seamus’ at that point, he’d moved so far forward in his chair. He nodded intently, urging Seamus to finish.

“He rubbed me. Right there in the club in front of everyone, although I doubt they noticed; rubbed me right through my jeans and finished me off right there on the dance floor.”

Dean just stared, completely oblivious to anything except Seamus who’d just told him he’d let a bloke practically pull him off in a crowded club. He’d never been so glad the common room was empty as he was right at that moment.

Seamus just stared back, and Dean held his gaze as Seamus’ hand tentatively reached out and his fingers trailed lightly down Dean’s arm. Dean felt the goose bumps rise on his dark skin as his whole body shivered slightly at the touch.

Dean knew Seamus was going to kiss him just moments before their lips touched, and he never moved; just sat there stunned while his best mate slid his hand behind Dean’s neck and pressed his lips more firmly against his own.

God, it felt incredible, and Dean could feel his whole body, especially the lower regions, instantly respond to the closeness.

Dean’s head was swimming, his mind was cloudy, and he barely acknowledged the hand that wasn’t his own creeping slowly across his knee, and then he froze. Seamus pulled back, seemingly to see why Dean had halted the kiss.

Dean looked up at Seamus shakily.

“Fuck!”

“Dean?” Seamus questioned.

“I can’t… I’m not... Just fuck.”

Dean jumped from the chair, knocking his cold tea flying onto the carpet and bolted from the common room and straight up the stairs.

Seamus ventured up to the boy’s dorm a little while later, calling Dean’s name softly as not to wake the other Gryffindor boys.

Dean laid there, eyes closed tight against the darkness, and pretended to be asleep.

~*~

 

Dean folded the creased parchment one more time and set it on the night table.

They hadn’t spoken again since that night. The following morning, Dean had managed to avoid Seamus on the train home by sitting with Neville and Ginny. Seamus, he presumed, had sat in their usual"
"full of rubble, buildings toppled and streetlamps barricading the roads haphazardly.

You’re here reluctantly, only present after five different people who you are at least seventy percent sure you can trust have told you to come here.  A new information source, they (Kingsley Shacklebolt, Dean Thomas, Narcissa Malfoy – trustworthy the moment Draco was killed in front of her – Nymphadora Tonks, and Ginny Weasley.)

(Ginny died three days ago, but that’s irrelevant and you can’t afford to think about anything that doesn’t matter andwhendidGinnynotmatterwhatishappeningwhywhywhy-)

“Granger?”

The voice is raspy and quiet and that doesn’t matter because you’d flinch as violently as you just have if it’d been loud and brazen or melodious and smooth. 

The cloaked, hooded figure steps closer as you back into an alleyway, forcing confusion (feigned) and fear (real, oh so real) onto your face.  “I’m sorry, who are you?”  Your voice is quavering, even as that cold, calculating part of your mind is judging the proximity to the Centre, trying to determine just how much wandless magic (don’t forget to take into account wasted output, uncontained radiation) you can get away with while still avoiding detection.

But then the figure huffs, and crosses its arms in a gesture that’s oddly familiar, even through the haze of the last two months.

“Honestly, Granger, you haven’t gotten any better at lying, have you?”

 

~

 

“You’re dead,” you repeat despite all evidence to the contrary, tripping over rock shards and mannequins, tree branches and power lines as you try to keep up with Draco (Malfoy, you correct yourself, because you could only call him Draco when you knew he was dead and you were still feeling guilty about thinking of him as an annoying little twat.)

From the roll of his eyes that you feel without seeing, he obviously seems to agree with your mind, which keeps telling your mouth to shut up because dead people don’t walk and talk (and they don’t tend to have smooth skinned marred by horrific acid burn scars and deep claw marks that still expose bone despite layers upon layers of healing magic). “Clearly, I’m not.  Now shut up, Granger, and keep moving.”

Where are we going?  The words die on your tongue, unsaid, as you round the corner.

No.  Please, no.  Your left hand flies to your pocket – useless, your wand is broken you idiot! – and by the time you’ve collected yourself to reach out through the barrier of wandlessness to your magic while attempting to stagger backwards, it’s too late.  Something grips your limbs, takes hold of your muscles and drains them, leaving you loose and pliant, with just barely enough control to lean against a rough stone wall, painfully aware of the fact that you can’t feel your magic as anything more than a barely-audible, distant murmur.

Untouchable.

“Who was it?” you manage to ask quietly around the lassitude, voice flat and expressionless like you imagine your face to be.  He glances back at you, and you catch the barest glint of pity in his eyes.

“Isn’t it obvious, Granger?” Draco says gently.  “All of them.”

“Good work, Draco,” a voice says warmly, and Draco bows his head before looking at you one last time.

The corner of his mouth twitches upwards, a sardonic, hollow grin.  “Sorry,” he whispers before bowing again and stepping away, making to leave you, alone in the empty Colosseum-esque arena you find yourself in.

“Ah, Draco.”  The voice is still pleasant and fond, but you can sense what’s coming in your bones.  “I don’t believe you’ve been dismissed.”

Your old school rival can sense it too, you know, because there’s a muted despair in his eyes when he turns around, as your eyes flicker in between him and the other.  “My Lord, you offered me immunity,” he says, even though you can tell he knows it’s not going to work.

“Yes, yes, I did.”  You close your eyes but the beautiful, melodious syllables still thrum through your veins.  “But you know what’s interesting about bargaining with traitors, Draco?”  Almost as an afterthought, you hear a mild “And Hermione, sweetheart, please open your eyes.”

Oh God.  It takes an effort, a long hard effort to force your lids up, and you wouldn’t have if not for the iron in that voice, that horribly familiar different alien voice.  Even when you finally get them open, seeing through a haze of exhausted tears, you don’t look straight ahead; you keep turned towards Draco.

“That’s it.”  There’s smug pleasure in those two words.  “Now, Draco; as much as I appreciate your efforts, how am I going to know that you’re not going to turn out a traitor?  Again, that is.”

To"
"known her like this earlier. Before.

Before I let my father and friends poison my mind. Before I became the perfect Pure-blooded Slytherin I was groomed to be. Before I took the dreaded tattoo that would be forever etched on my skin, marking me for the Death Eater I was.

She came in like a storm of Magical proportions, but she'd come too late.

Or maybe she came too soon. Before I could shield my heart from the pain and guilt that tears through me as her fingers continue to caress my cheek, neck and shoulder. Before I could built up my resistance and ready myself to live the way I had since the Final Battle.

But no, she had to come and change me. To make me irrecognizable to even myself. Or maybe she just pulled to the surface what was there, underneath, the entire time.

I shake when she finally leans in and presses her lips against mine. As cold as her fingers, and as damp.

I pull her against me and close the door.

She mesmerizes me with the emotions that show on her face. I've always been able to close myself off, to keep my feelings locked up and shielded by haughty, indifferent, expressions.

Not her. She couldn't keep what she was feeling from me if her life depended on it. And how I wish she tried. How I wish she tried not to love me, for it made me want to be a woman worthy of her love. She's like the sun, showing me there will be a dawn, showing me there is something left to live for, but at the same time her light shines brightest upon the vilest parts of my soul.

Her bravery emphasizes my cowardice, the softness of her heart clashes with my rough edges, and more importantly, she was on the right side of the War, and I wasn't.

When we're together like this, I'm unable to hide. I'm thankful she closes her eyes, as it's my only reprieve, the only thing keeping her from seeing who I really am.

Her black dress is simple but stylish and falls off her slender hips like a waterfall. She lifts her delicate feet one by one to step out of it, and is left standing in front of me in her panties, stockings and heels. I love the contrast of black fabric against her pale freckled skin, and I can't think of a single reason to keep myself from running my hands down her sides and thighs.

When I trail tiny kisses over the line of her jaw down her neck she sighs and whimpers, and when I take a step back towards the bed, her whimpers turn into an almost broken sound.

It takes me but a second to pull my own dress over my head and release the clasp that holds my hair together. I reach out and tangle my fingers through hers, softly tugging her along until the back of my knees hit the edge of the bed, and then we're falling.

Falling through air, through the softness of rich cotton and a goose feather duvet. Falling while time stands still between the four walls of this room.

Because tomorrow everything will be different.

Tomorrow it all has to end.

Her pants are heavy and pleading, her skin heated and her heart is beating the same wild rhythm as mine while we move. Like a dance of desperation. One that only ends when we tire, or morning comes.

It's all fingers and tongue and softly spoken words, but most of all it's emotion I'm not ready to voice. Not now, and maybe not ever.

It isn't until 3 am, when we're both sated and content, and those strong stubborn brown eyes are slowly losing the fight against sleep across my pillow, that I feel panic rise up in my bones. I don't know how I'll be able to do this.

Still, I tell myself 'a year'. Draco only got one year, and I never even did anything.

I never lead a group of Death Eaters into Hogwarts, or used any Unforgivables. I didn't kill, torture or maim anyone. If I'm being honest, my biggest crime was 'being scared'.

But I'm still scared. I'm scared out of my mind. I'm not the sort of person that just survives prison unscathed. Even if the Dementors were banned from Azkaban, it is a dreadful place, and certainly not a place for me. Was it? Wasn't that why I ran in the first place?

I should've kept running, should've stopped myself from sending that Owl, but I hadn't been able to. There was just something about the redheaded woman that confronted me in the middle of the Great Hall. The one that had stepped in front of Potter when I'd been so irrationally frightened by the threat of death, that I'd have offered him up for slaughter myself.

When I'd heard she'd lost one of her"
"terrible, wonderful things to him. ""Then I'll have to go shopping again sometime.""

Yes, perhaps, and Severus leaned down, pressing his mouth to Draco's shoulder before beginning to push the dress off of him. His fingers tangled in smaller straps and he paused, pulling away for a moment to see what it was.

Lingerie. Black straps that implied something silky once he got the dress off of Draco.

""Only if I can accompany you. And watch you try things on."" And embarrass the store staff and generally enjoy himself by scandalizing Muggles without having to show a tiny flash of any magics that could get him detected. There were so many other ways to take things out on people, and so many other ways to enjoys himself.

His lips found skin, hand stealing inside the dress to stroke it further off of Draco. The difference in texture between the two materials was quite nice, and the shivering response he got implied that his touch was greatly appreciated even as the dress fell to the floor. ""Mmmm. I'll have to find a specialty store, then, for proper lingerie.""

""Garter belts?"" That Severus could imagine that quite so well was probably telling, but he liked it. Kissed the back of Draco's neck and just let his hands roam slowly, feeling, enjoying Draco in his arms. ""There, I think you can step out of it now. I'll hang it up later.""

It was no surprise when Draco turned instead of stepping out. He had never followed orders at all well, so Severus simply expected the unexpected. ""Take me to bed and make me yours.""

He nudged Draco backwards with a knee and pressure from his thigh, and tried not to step on the dress while they moved past it. ""Shall I leave your lingerie on?""

""Oh, yes."" Yes, of course, that was certainly part of the draw. It was lovely, black in the light coming in from the hallway and the window with an edge of lace at the bottom. Leaving it on would leave the image of a pretty woman, never mind the lovely young man who lay beneath that slip of silk.

He still liked the lovely young man best, but it pleased Draco to try on new roles, new skins, to imagine and pretend. Severus was more than willing to help him with that. Particularly as it garnered him moments like his pet lying back on the mattress, legs akimbo, the edge of silk highlighting his skin. The delightful curl of his mouth, the way one hand trailed up his stomach to press against a chest that still looked fuller than it should, well. That was just one of the many benefits he hadn't truly expected when they'd gotten into this particular situation.

""Fuck me."" Ah, his lips said one thing, but the way he moved implied another altogether, and Severus moved over him, capturing that wicked mouth with his own. He tasted sharply of chocolate and exotic fruit with a faint edge of wine, and that made him want Draco even more.

He took his time tasting, lips lingering slowly against Draco's mouth while he let his fingers linger up the outside line of Draco's thigh. ""Perhaps."" Perhaps, except that wasn't what Draco wanted. Not really, and one smooth leg came up, leaving himself even more open to Severus's touch.

""Please."" It was a very pretty word, one that he enjoyed hearing as it parted those lips, and he moved, turning into Severus so sweetly that it was difficult not to take advantage of him more quickly.

He stayed his own hand, just rucking the edge of that lace line a little higher, enough to get a teasing brush of fingers against Draco's balls. The sigh and half a groan he got for his effort was worth the time he took lingering. Most of the time, Draco was of the faster-harder-more school of sex. This was something new -- teasing him was making him even hotter, making him writhe and squirm and bite at his lips. The enjoyment of that alone meant that they would inevitably have to do this again.

Taking his time was no hardship, not when it got him more kisses, teasing brushes against Draco's genitals, a bit of fabric hitched down so he could stroke the edge of Draco's chest, pressing against sensitive skin but not quite able to reach where he wanted to. ""More?""

""Please."" He liked that word, wanted more of it. Draco whimpered prettily when he was kissed, and Severus slipped a hand down over the silk. It was something of a surprise to find the warmth of a small breast beneath his fingertips, the nipple pearled into hardness and slightly larger than usual. The flush sneaking over Draco's nose and cheeks made him want to kiss him again, and he saw no reason to resist that urge.

He gave a laugh, not mocking, just enjoyment, and gently tweaked that nipple, pressing between thumb and forefinger. ""Marvelous. You're a master of"
"or even worse, accept them) – and you’d follow.

You’ll follow him into death if need be.

Tom Riddle, you think, sounding out the name in your head.

He glances at you, pinning you with his gaze, and you freeze in your seat.

He smiles slightly, still staring directly at you, before looking away and continuing to speak, though you don’t hear what he’s saying.

You don’t need to.

 


II.


Tom Riddle.

 He fucks you the same way he speaks, the way he does everything.  It’s torturously slow, almost clinical, but underscored by a raging heat that dominates and sets your nerves on fire.

“Tom,” you gasp out when you come, and you’re so dazed that you barely feel him freeze inside of you.

Later, as you’re running fingers over his pale skin, he says quietly, “’Tom’ was my father’s name.  A common, disgusting Muggle name.”

Muggle?  “You’re a half-blood?” and it’s so hard to conceal your tone of disgust, but you think you manage.  It’s impossible, that this man, teeming with power and nobility, could ever be so base.

In one fluid movement, he’s hovering over you, hands to your neck; you choke, gasping desperately for air.

“I might look like him,” he hisses coldly (but his rage is burning and it’s so deliciously painful, you can’t help but want more of it), “but I am Salazar’s heir.  Don’t forget it.”

 


III.



Voldemort.



Lord Voldemort.


Death has never frightened you, but he is your Lord (your master your lover) so you don’t tell him that you preferred the name Tom.

Tom is a lover’s name, Voldemort a master’s.

He still fucks you, but doesn’t stay afterwards; he doesn’t linger in bed, doesn’t let you touch his skin (that’s getting paler and paler even as his eyes lose their incongruous soft brown to what looks disconcertingly like the colour of Gryffindor rubies).

But he still spends time with you, still smiles approvingly when you come up with a new idea to convert the stupid sheep that make up the Wizarding world.

Anything for that.

 


IV.


You don’t start off finding happiness in suffering.  Oh, Andromeda (blood traitor whore but always a Black, always your sister) and Cissy might talk about you killing animals; but never for the pain.  You’re curious – how much blood lost before it’s too much, what the inside of a cat looks like.

They didn’t understand, but your Lord does; he recognises where your talents lie, gives you purpose where nothing else has.  He’s your guiding light, through obsequious Ministry officials wanting nothing more than to be seen with you to raise their miserable social statuses.

 


V.


You don’t find happiness in suffering but you laugh when the Longbottoms scream.  You wish their son was here, their little newborn baby that’s off with his grandmother (not that you’re worrying about that, because the next miserable life on your list is Augusta Longbottom).  You want to tear them apart then put them back together, want to find a way to make sure they die over and over till he comes back and then you’ll kill all these blood traitors together, you and him.

 


VI.


Azkaban makes you crazy, perhaps.

But you’ve been insane since you met him.

And that will never change, you vow, as Dementors steal everything from you that made you want to live (everything but him, nothing can take that, and so when you’re rocking backwards and forwards on your pile of straw, you don’t think about your sisters what sisters only him)

Only him.

 


VII.


It’s the happiest day of your life when you realise you’re going to see him again.


And then you do.


He’s not who (what) you remember (no fire just ice, cold and harsh and unforgiving and he was all of those but so much more and you can’t bring yourself to think that-)

But you’re not what you remember, either.

 


VIII.


Bella.  He still calls you Bella, even if his voice is cold and affectionless, even if he doesn’t smile at you like he used to, even if he doesn’t order you to join him in bed.  He trusts you, even if he doesn’t love you (never loved you), even if he doesn’t want you.

Azkaban has ruined you for him, but nothing can ruin him for you.


Only him.


 


IX.


Your spirit lingers, resisting Death’s call and the choice you have to make.  You see his anger when you fall and something in you smiles. 

When Potter strikes him down, when his body falls broken to the ground, you wait.

Nothing rises from the"
"younger male replied with a grin and they both slowly got up.

Both their robes were covered in dust all over.

“I think we might need to check out the size of our bathtub now,” Harry said into Tom’s ear slyly and began undressing him with a mischievous grin on his face.

 

*

Harry woke up in the middle of the night, unable to feel his legs. He was absolutely freezing.

“Tom, give me back some of the cover,” he whined, trying to pull it back over himself, to no avail. His lover was wrapped up in the cover like a thick cocoon and wouldn’t budge.

He looked at the clock beside him, it was 5 am. He groaned and got out of bed. Maybe a hot chocolate would warm him up a bit and then he could try to pry the cover off Tom without waking him. Disrupting the Slytherin’s sleep was equal to having a death wish, so he had no desire to do that.

The kitchen was a mess. How had they managed to pile up so many dishes in two days? They had both been busy… Tom was working two shifts each day and Harry was teaching Quidditch at the newly founded Institute for the Education of Young Muggleborns. The brats were incorrigible. They didn’t listen; they had no coordination in their play and no will to learn. It left Harry completely beat each day and doing any housework was the last thing on his mind. Tom usually came back after Harry was asleep so they barely even got to see each other.

He mixed the hot chocolate with milk, his eyes dull and unfocused. He was really tired. If he went back to bed now, he’d be late for work later, since he had to leave at half past 7 to get there on time. The anti-apparition wards around the grounds of the Institute, made it impossible to get there easily.

“Harry?” sounded Tom’s sleepy voice from the bedroom. “What are you doing?”

“I couldn’t sleep because someone stole the whole cover for himself,” Harry glared at his lover accusingly, going back through to their room.

“Well, get in here and go back to sleep. You’re making too much noise in the kitchen,” Tom grumbled. “I can’t sleep when you’re not here.”

Harry froze. He wasn’t sure if he’d heard that correctly. After a minute of contemplation, he smirked to himself. Tom had said it, although he would probably deny it to his dying day. But Harry had heard it and really, he couldn’t even stay mad about waking up from the cold anymore. He climbed back into bed and allowed his lover to drape his arms over him. Delicious warmth spread through his body and he snuggled closer, to feel Tom’s chest rising up and down in calm motions.

 

*

 

“Harry, how many times do I have to ask you to do the dishes?” Tom asked with annoyance, ruining his perfect, lazy, late Saturday morning.

“You can do it, you’re better at cleaning spells than me anyway,” Harry whined, turning his face back into the comfy pillow.

“Perhaps, but I, unlike you, work two jobs so we can live somewhat comfortably. I don’t have the time-“ Tom started and Harry groaned.

“I already do all the tidying and the laundry!”

“Yeah, but you also spend more time here.”

“I’m not your bloody housewife, Tom!” Harry huffed and turned away. A few minutes later, he heard Tom slam the door, leaving without saying bye.

“Hmph,” he curled up in the covers, trying to fend off the fast approaching guilt for taking out his frustration on Tom.

His lover didn’t return until really late, when Harry was starting to worry. Tom had a tendency to stir up trouble when he was angry…

Harry spent most of the afternoon pacing around the room nervously and fire calling his friends to ask for advice on what to do. Ron was useless, as always. Emotional range of a teaspoon, as Hermione succinctly stated after hearing what advice he had tried to give Harry.

She was a much better listener for all his worries and said to occupy himself with something until Tom got back, then simply apologise and talk it out.

Harry knew it was reasonable, but… she has never seen Tom when he was angry. He was downright murderous when something didn’t go his way. When he got like that, it was difficult for even Harry to placate him without risk of injury.

He sighed heavily. All he could do now was to sit and wait.

*

 

Tom’s anger had now been reduced to a slow simmer. He could never really stay angry at Harry for too long. He was on his way back from dishing out some punishment to his misbehaving followers, which, admittedly, helped relieve a lot of his stress.

He… almost felt bad for storming out of their flat in the morning. Harry had been unreasonable, but"
"with Smithly. Harry made sure to head home before Draco would come to pick up his son, and spent the night brooding alone at home.

 



 




The following weeks were quite busy for Harry. A group of young vampires was causing trouble in Knockturn Alley, and he had to supervise an Auror guard to keep the streets in and around Diagon safe for both the customers and the shopkeepers.

The combination of long days and restless nights was breaking him up, and when they finally caught the culprits red-handed, Harry was tired and unfocused.

It was stupid, really. He’d known from witness statements that the group was made up of five vampires, so he also should’ve known they weren’t finished when they bound four of them. Still, it didn’t occur to him until a pair of sharp teeth dug into his neck.

The little bugger was petrified by one of the other Aurors, but not before he’d drained a good portion of Harry’s blood.

He was lightheaded and staggered a little. Smithly was next to him in a flash, and pulled Harry’s arm over his shoulder, yelling at their colleagues that he was going to take Harry to St Mungo’s.

“Fuck, no,” he moaned. “Stop fretting, I’m fine. Nothing a good night’s sleep won’t fix.”

“But Harry,” Smithly whined, “you should see a Healer. I’ll take you, it’ll be alright.”

Harry pulled back his arm and pushed his partner away. “You’re not taking me anywhere. I’m going home. Tell Robards I’m taking a few personal days.”

He Apparated home and slumped on his couch. He would sit there for a little while, gathering the strength to drag himself upstairs to his bed.

 



 




The sound of the doorbell roughly pulled Harry from a most wonderful dream. He’d been in bed with Draco’s strong hands softly caressing his back, as a mouth traced light kisses over his shoulder and down his arm.

Harry blinked and looked around him, only to realise he’d fallen asleep on the couch, alone, in his Auror robes.

The doorbell rang again.

“Fuck,” Harry swore under his breath, but stood and made his way to the door anyway.

“Oh, thank God, you’re here,” Hermione said, as he opened the door and she rushed past him. “We need to talk.”

Harry slowly closed the front door and turned to face her. “Good evening, Hermione. How lovely to see you. Why don’t you come in,” he said dryly, and followed her to the living room.

“What on earth did you do to your neck?” Hermione asked, when he slumped back down on the couch.

Harry opened his mouth to reply, but she immediately cut him off.

“Never mind, it can wait. What do you know about Veela?”

She looked at him intently as he ran his hand through his hair. “Er, they’re beautiful and they have wings sometimes? Fleur is a Veela, isn’t she?”

“Fleur is only part Veela, but it doesn’t matter. A Veela is a being by the Classification Act of 1811. They are close to human physiology, but not completely the same. They mate for life. Once they do, they’re impotent to anyone else,” she said and kicked Harry’s leg. “Don’t you fall asleep, Harry! This is important!”

“Sorry, Hermione, but you burst into my house like there’s a bloody fire going on,” he replied, feeling rather irritated. “And then you go on about some useless trivia about Veela. Will you get to the point?”

“Draco’s a Veela.”

Harry cleared his head with a little shake and considered her words. “Er, no.”

“He is,” Hermione replied. “Hetty Ballard of the Being Division called in sick today, so I was filling in for her when the Aurors called for the registration papers for the vampires you caught this morning. It was when I was searching for Jenz Malfurion’s papers my eye caught the name Malfoy. Draco’s a Veela, Harry, and so was his father.”

He frowned. “I’m sorry to be crude, but Draco can’t be a Veela. He was most definitely not impotent when I fucked him, and he sure as hell fucked around on me enough to impregnate Scorpius’s mother. Unless you’re trying to tell me the boy is not his son.”

“No, what I’m trying to tell you is Draco is Scorpius’s mother, for all intents and purposes!”

Rubbing the palms of his hands over his eyes, Harry tried to process what Hermione was saying. Draco was a man, most definitely. Men didn’t get pregnant. Though, hadn’t she said something about near human physiology? Could male Veela get pregnant? Was that what she was telling him? But did that mean Draco"
"for Remus. His pallor hadn't gotten any better since school, though Remus supposed he was older and stronger and covered in a bloody lot more scars than he'd been then. That could've applied to the both of them.

They were both marked, one way or another. ""It is fortunately a very simple ritual,"" he said using a quill to scratch in a combination of Ancient runes into the soft tallow. ""But it is best to keep questions as simple as you can. You can ask what you wish once we begin, as long as you can stand the wax upon you. Would you believe Muggles try this by dropping it into water?""

""All they're divining is the fate of the water's source. Useful, I suppose, if one is very concerned about water."" He was watching, at least, some mild interest now that Remus as at work on it.

""A sanitized version of when they used to drop it into bowls of blood,"" Remus said as he finished the runes. ""There, that should do it.""

No doubt Severus was surprised he knew about such Dark magic, but he had more than a passing acquaintance. ""Are you ready?""

""Yes."" As he would ever be, and he was ready, waiting for Remus to crouch own closer, no doubt, and light the candle before he asked his question.

""Remember, the longer you can stand the wax dripping on you, the more powerful the divination will be, the more details and accuracy,"" Remus replied looking seriously at Snape. He chose to kneel then and with a flick of his wand, lit the candle, to channel magic within it and hold the flow of his own magic pouring into the candle. He muttered the spell's incantations under his breath, which he always suspected was just a ploy to make sure the wax had started melting properly and then held it over Snape’s chest.

White on white skin the first drop fell, splashing on the skin before becoming more opaque. It did not completely set, but instead flowed into the drop that joined it.

He watched Snape flinch, watching the wax fall on his chest, waiting for a few more splashes before he asked anything. ""Are my loyalties still trusted by the Dark Lord?""

The wax swirled on skin, still hot and fluid and Remus could only imagine what it must feel like as it shaped and sought the truth from bare skin to bare soul. It flowed first into the shape of spider what walked its hot wax body down the curve of the potion master’s abdomen. ""The spider -- spinning a trap with suspicion."" Not a complete answer and the wax dripped again swelling the hot wax pool each time it dropped.

The man inhaled. ""Does whatever is left of Tom Riddle still believe I serve him?"" That was a strange question, a strange wording, but important to the man, as far as Remus could tell.

The spider flowed hot wax into a long thin snake that turned and crawled back up to Snape’s chest. It slithered around his nipple flicking a tongue of stinging wax to lap at them before coiling over jealously over his heart, a trail of livid scalded skin behind it. ""The snake believes a heart is his, a service won through sensual gifts and secret moments.""

Remus felt his own face grow hot. He started to consider what that might actually mean and had to struggle to retain the divinatory magic flow.

""Does whatever is left of Tom Riddle believe I would betray him?"" Not could, no, because Remus was willing to believe that Snape could strangle his own mother one handed while reading a newspaper, but he also found it dubious and somewhat unlikely, even with the capacity. He shifted his footing, and more wax dropped, adding to the fluid heat that was the snake.

The wax had to burn; he could see the red trails on the pale white skin as the snake coiled and moved again. It raised up, the wax flaring into a hooded cobra in attack posture, even as the next stream of wax, surely painful, flowed into the shape of a dragon that seemed to try and usurp that place over Snape's heart. ""The snake believes his rightful place over your heart is shared or usurped by the dragon. A stolen heart could lead to betrayal.""

""Oh, bloody hell."" Snape closed his eyes tightly, and then exhaled raggedly. Remus was expecting him to ask him to stop, but he didn't. ""Now if only I knew what the dragon was supposed to symbolize.""

To Remus's surprise, the wax flowed suddenly down to Severus's navel and a second smaller dragon bubbled up out of the magically fluid hot wax. ""The dragon has young."" Remus watched as it rather alarmingly disappeared downwards out of his immediate sight. ""You have protected the young dragon.""

It had to be Malfoy.

Snape jerked a little, and Circe knew where that wax had gone. His thoughts about it twining and slithering in burning heat around Snape’s cock brought a flush to his cheeks.

It wasn't always like this, wasn't hurtful, wasn't a mess. It use to be fun to be around his father, every day a wonderful story, used to be safe at home. But After his mother died it became a living hell, his father a ticking time bomb. No matter how hard Theo tried to stay out of trouble His father would still beat him, he would still be scarred. He would Beat him Senselessly, would laugh as Theo Pleaded for him to stop, would jeer when Theo was nothing more then a pile of broken skin and bones, was a broken bird shaking in a pool of his own blood. His father would then leave, not to Get Towels to get the blood off and apologize. It was never that, it was always Him getting scissors, in which he would chop of Feather after feather off of Theo Beautiful Grey wings. Only atfer would theo Be able to get up, To stumble to the bathroom on shaking legs. Where He would Clean himself off with tears pouring down his Pale face, where he Would Look in the mirror and stare at his wings, he then would to his bedroom and lock the door. Then he would collapse into his bed with his thin sheets and Shake the whole bed with his sobs. His father used to be some what nice when his mother was alive, They still have pictures of Him and His father hugging with big smiles on their faces. Those days were now forgotten, only memories locked away. But after the death of his wife His father succumbed to the darkness that lies inside of everyone, and the only way to Push it back was to hurt his only son, but the darkness came back. It always came back. So he cut he wings and made sure His bird wouldn't fly away. He kept him caged while other birds Flew away. But No matter what Theo never gave up, He didn't bother to fly atfer all his wings Couldn't hold him. But he never did hate his father, he understood what he had to do So his father wouldn't go crazy. So he suffered, suffered while his friends flew away, suffered when his father beat him, cut his wings, suffered when he Would plead to god- to his mother- to save him, but no one did. Theo wings were the only thing that helped him remember his mother, his wings were her's in a way. But when they were cut his mother started to fly away, to vanish. Theo would reach for her crying, but no matter how hard he reached for her she still Flew away. Leaving him alone in this hell. So he suffered, the person he used to be was gone, he vanished when his mother died and left him alone. He didn't want to be alone as Selfish as it was- he wished It was different. He longed for The old days. He started to give up, atfer all he was a boy with broken wings. Then he met The love of his life who didn't care about his wings, didn't care that he was broken. They fell in love slowly, Like snow falling on the ground. They shared their first kiss under a tree in they shade, they lost Their innocence on Christmas Eve. He didn't care that Theo was damaged. He loved him for all his flaws. A boy with damaged wings found Comfort in the boy Who Had a bad past. They didn't care about the bad things, they only loved each other. Never fought never Yelled. A boy with damaged wings started to Fly with the help of Blaise
"
"Order’s Golden Boy aside, Draco still felt like an outsider amongst his new companions. After his father broke out of Azkaban the previous summer, his mother had disappeared and he hadn’t heard from either of them since. Draco assumed his parents, or at least his father, were fully involved in the strategy planning the Order was following through well-placed spies, but he didn’t know anything more than that and really didn’t want to.

Draco’s anger at being forgotten, and at not being as important as the Dark Lord’s cause sent him running to Professor Snape with promises to do whatever he could to help bring Voldemort down. The Potions Master had been sceptical at first, not quite understanding what brought about Draco’s sudden change of reasoning, but with time and many late-night conversations Draco’s allegiance had become understood and accepted.

So here he was, housed at Order headquarters with people who he’d never considered friends, listening outside the door to their private conversations. Not quite the best way to get off on the right foot.

When he heard the chairs scrape against the kitchen floor, Draco jumped, startled from his thoughts, Not wanting to have to explain his indiscretion, he tiptoed back upstairs, his mind swirling with information.

 

~*~*~

 

Harry went about his nightly routine quietly as not to wake Ron who was snoring loudly in the small bed across the room. His earlier conversation with Remus played heavily on his mind as he climbed into bed and pulled the cotton sheets up to his chin. He lay there for some time, his thoughts preventing him from sleeping as they often did.

After tossing and turning for what seemed like hours, Harry sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed. He needed to talk to Draco.

The two boys had an unconventional friendship, if you could even call it that. Harry couldn’t explain it really. Draco understood him, and wasn’t afraid to tell him what was really on his mind.

When things were confusing, or damn right awful, Hermione and Ron were almost too smothering with their good intentions and careful words. Draco wasn’t like that. He was the first to tell Harry if he thought he was being a git, or if he was angry for no good reason. It was refreshing, if not a little humbling on occasion. He could always count on Draco to tell him the truth.

Harry thought they had made great strides from enemies to friends, but not everyone else felt the same. Most of the order had a difficult time accepting Draco, but for some reason Harry trusted the other boy, and needed him in an odd way.

Sometimes Harry wondered if there was a little more to it; a snippet of something he couldn’t quite explain. Some of the things Draco said, some of the comfort he provided made Harry wonder just what Draco really did think about him. Generally he brushed it off, not wanting to think too much about things he didn’t really understand.

Toeing his feet into a pair of too-big slippers, Harry padded out the door and down the corridor to Draco’s room.

 

~*~*~

 

Harry knocked tentatively at Draco’s bedroom door. Although the boys talked often, Harry still worried about interrupting Draco or getting in the way. Draco called for him to come in, so he opened the door and glanced around the immaculate room. Harry was always amazed at how tidy Draco was. Harry wasn’t near as careful with his things, and since Ron wasn’t any better, their room usually looked like a bomb had gone off.

“Hope you don’t mind,” Harry asked, moving into the room and perching at the end of Draco’s bed.

Draco shook his head and kicked a few pieces of stray ribbon and a pair of scissors under the bed before he sat down beside Harry.

“What’s on your mind?”

Harry paused for a few moments to collect his muddled thoughts. Draco was always willing to listen when he needed to vent or sort things out, but he was never really sure how much Draco would really want to know.

“Remus was telling me about my parents again. I don’t know why I still let it get to me, but you know after Sirius died I really started to wonder more about what they’d been like.”

Harry lowered his eyes, the expression on his face matching the troubled tone in his voice.

“I felt the need to hang onto whatever memories Remus had to replace the ones that I can’t conjure up in my head. Sirius and Remus knew them so well and I never got the chance. When I talk to Remus, it’s like I can almost remember them, but not quite. It’s frustrating.”

Something about the pensive look in Draco’s grey eyes almost made it seem as though the other boy understood first hand what Harry was getting at and his reply was barely audible.

“Sometimes I think it’s better not to have known.”

Harry searched the blonde’s face for clues"
"Yes, professor."" Yes, but he was doing it anyway, which meant he should be bleeding. That or the house had best be on fire.

Severus groaned darkly, and turned from his cauldron, casting a holding spell over the mess mid boil. Draco could tell he was in for it, at least until Severus's eyes met his, and then, then Draco knew he had him.

Licking his lips, Draco drew in a breath and then dropped to his knees slowly before he began to crawl forward, his tail twitching behind him, ears perked forward with kittenish interest. This was a sure bet for dragging Severus back to himself most times, but he tried not to pull it out of his little bag of tricks until he had no other choice. He was desperate, so crawling naked across the floor with his tail twitching was actually a good plan, an excellent plan, particularly given the way Severus was watching him. He gave a quiet cluck of his tongue. ""You'll scrape your knees.""

Maybe. Probably, even, but he didn't give a damn, just moved closer and closer, back swaying with motion, and when he reached Severus, he sat up, lapped a tongue across the back of one wrist and smiled invitingly. ""Meow."" Silly, so silly, but also... fun and appealing and he could tell that Severus liked it.

The edge of his mouth quirked -- while he was still fighting it, he was also losing. ""The lab is no place for a cat.""

Leaning in, Draco rubbed against his leg, arm brushing at him through robes and trousers. It was a little too cool, that was true, and if something spilled it might be disastrous, but it was worth taking the chance. He mewled again and pressed himself a bit closer, tail twitching behind him.

""Merlin."" Severus sighed, and crouched down carefully, fingers moving immediately to one soft furred ear. The purr he gave was in no way a pretense; that felt much too wonderful for him to do anything but respond, lean into the touch and look up at Severus before putting one curled hand up on his thigh.

""Wait for me outside. I'll clean up and come out of the lab."" Which wasn't as much fun as being fucked over a worktable, but Severus said it while still stroking at his ear, so he'd obviously hit the right button. Leaning up, he licked Severus's stained fingers delicately, nuzzling them and then turning slowly, reluctantly, glancing over his shoulder with a saucy sort of invitation as he slunk his way towards the door.

It would be worth the scraped knees.

He headed for the library because the main chair was comfortable and he rather liked being fucked in it if he couldn't have a work table. Draco wasn't there long before he heard Severus coming down the hallway.

There was a familiar rhythm to it, the way he walked, steady, brisk, purposeful. He had always sounded like that to Draco's recollection, and he hummed in appreciation, curling himself in the chair and allowing his tail to twitch-twitch-twitch with the anticipation.

He didn't look up when Severus closed the door behind himself, just waited to feel fingers lingering at the back of his neck, stroking slowly down his spine. It had to feel good -- soft skin, fur blending in where his tail moved involuntarily with pleasure at the way Severus skritched gently, making him moan in pleasure. It was quite enjoyable for him, and he would do it more often, but then it might lose the power it had to drag Severus out of a Mood, and that wasn't worth it. It was much better to hold it as a tool -- and a very effective tool, from the way Severus lifted his fingers, curled them behind his ear. ""Sit up.""

Up, and he lifted onto his knees, making a little noise of pleasure at the steady rub of Severus's thumb. Oh, that was... yes. Yes, and he whimpered, thrusting his head into that caress more firmly.

Severus shifted, slipping and forcing himself in between Draco and the chair, easing in comfortably. ""Hmn. My unexpected lap-Draco.""

In all honesty, the idea of a lap-dragon was ridiculous, and yet. It was delicious, curling into that warm lap, all soft sounds and flickering furry ears and tail, allowing Severus to pet him. It felt wonderful, and he didn't bother to stop the little pleasured sounds he made. There was no point, and if it helped things along, well. All to the good. He liked being petted, regardless of the circumstances. He liked being petted by Severus, liked the way his long, stained fingers lingered reverently against his skin, liked the added side to side motion that touch took on when he had ears and a tail.

He was warm and ridiculously happy this way. He made no bones about it, and his tail whipped, wrapping around Severus's wrist and rubbing happily"
", took in his flabbergasted friend, and, with a strangled cry, he had turned around, presenting Sirius the back view of his pale and lean body.

There was a small thud when Remus let his forehead drop against the tiled wall.

''Sirius... I'm... what... can't you knock?''

Sirius was still too stunned to answer, all he could do was stare at Remus' firm globes, and the stream of water that ran down his spine and along his arse crack.

''I... I thought you were... injured...''

Remus turned his head, glaring over his shoulder at him.

''Well, as you can see, I'm not!'' he pressed out exasperatedly.

''But...'' Sirius swallowed, ''but you called my name!'' he complained, feeling strangely hurt when he should be glad that his friend was all right.

Remus eyes widened and he couldn't hide his face fast enough for Sirius to miss the deep blush on his cheeks.

''Why... ehm... oh...'' Sirius could feel his own cheeks heating up.

Remus whole body seemed to slump, his face hidden against the tiles.

''Padfoot... I'm... oh god... I'm so sorry... I...''

Whatever else, Sirius could never see his friend in pain. It was unacceptable. His hand reached out on its own accord, tentatively touching the glistening plane of Remus' back. Remus shuddered. A trembling sigh escaped from his throat.

''Siri... please... I...''

His whole body started to tremble when Sirius hand stroked down over his wet skin, still heated from the shower. So warm. There was an angry red mark just above his hip bone and Sirius hesitantly traced it with his finger tips.

Remus whimpered. ''Please... no... I can't...''

''Shhh...'' Sirius fingers trailed up Remus' spine, gently messaging his shoulder, the nape of his neck... He noticed the little ringlets Remus' wet hair was forming there, and he had the strange urge to press a kiss on that pale patch of skin just below. ''It's okay... Moony... it's okay...''

His hand glided up over Remus' neck, tentatively touching the wet ginger hair. Remus let out a sob.

''No, Moony...'' Sirius reached out to wrap his hand around Remus' far shoulder, pulling him against him, needing his friend to know that nothing, nothing ever could come between them. That he would always be loved, always be accepted.

Remus let his body fall limply against Sirius, pressing his face into his shoulder, mumbling, ''sorry, 'm sorry... I shouldn't... I... sorry...''

But Sirius wouldn't have Remus start with the apologies again. Grabbing his friend's head with both hands he forced Remus to look at him. The honey coloured eyes were wide and worried. Sirius let his thumb stroke along Remus' cheek bone. ''None of that, Moony.'' And then he leaned forward and pressed a soft kiss to that cheekbone. Remus inhaled sharply.

''There's nothing to apologize for, Remus,'' Sirius said, pressing a kiss further down on Remus' cheek, close to the corner of his mouth. Remus' lips trembled. It was a split second decision, and if asked, Sirius could not have given a reason why, apart from that they had looked so inviting and soft and pink, he couldn't help but press his own lips to them, inhaling Remus' earthy scent.

Remus moaned against his mouth, and there were arms wrapping around his back, and Sirius went with the flow and wrapped his own arms around Remus' trembling body, letting his hands glide over all that naked skin of his friend's back and his sides and his arse. He had no clue what he was doing but it felt good and right and Sirius wasn't someone to question a good thing.

''Love you...'' Remus mumbled huskily, ''Love you so much...''

And Sirius knew he did, there was no questioning of their feelings, he just never had thought it would be like this, but then he had been known to be clueless on occasion. Pressing Remus' body back against the tiles of the shower, he explored his friend's mouth, tasting Remus, so new and so familiar, not so different from a woman's mouth, and yet completely different because it was Remus.

His friend's hands were tugging urgently at his shirt, and he lifted up his arms to let his friend drag the offending garment off, and then Remus' skin was pressing against his own. It was a whole new feeling, closer, more intimate than ever before, a bit scary too, but so damn hot. He had never known that Remus was so hot.

He kissed him again, hungrily, and Remus responded with equal fierceness, his fingers digging into Sirius' back, one hand gliding down to cup his arse, pressing him closer against his raging erection. It was only then that Sirius became aware that he was hard himself. He didn't question it"
"Fuck.

That was all he could think. Fuck, because they had been at it for a while, fuck because Neville, that bastard, had been enjoying teasing him to the absolute and utter last of his ability to bear it.

He had even yelled. At least six times. Demanding, in fact, that he be allowed to come.

""I just want to... enjoy it, you know?"" Slow slide in and slow slide out, barely moving a quarter of an inch at a time. Or worse. He wasn't sure.

Draco couldn't keep himself from yelling again, squirming viciously. ""I've enjoyed it enough, now I want to come!"" 

""I haven't."" Neville eased his dick out again, and Merlin that was impossible. How on a earth was he even still moving? Draco felt like his bones were made of pudding, in sharp contrast to the stone-hard feeling of his cock, and he wanted desperately to make further demands. Wanted to come, and every time he got close, Neville muttered that damnable spell and he wanted to strangle him. Wanted to do a great many things, but there was also a sticking charm on both of his wrists and he couldn't very well reach down and do what he wanted.

The whole point of sticking charms was to keep him from doing anything fun, but it had seemed like a good idea. When they'd started, because now Neville was going to fuck his sanity out of him.

Bastard. ""Bastard, bastard, let me... Aaaahhh!"" Yelling didn't help; if it had, he would have been allowed to come by now.

This. This was what he got for having a relationship with a pureblood Gryffindor. A Mudblood would never consider the sticking charms, Draco was sure of it. Pure bloods knew everything, every spell, even if he'd been suspected as a squib for ages. There was probably a spell that was keeping his dick so fucking hard as well. ""Going to, uhmph, scream it out?""

""Yes!"" Yes, except Neville pulled out again, being deliberate about the way he did it, and Draco couldn't. Couldn't scream or yell, because all he could do was whimper and try to pull him in closer with his boneless legs.

Pulling him in only got him more dick, and Neville laughing slowly as he pulled back with ease. ""Draco, this hurts you more than it hurts me...""

Fucking Merlin. ""Yes, exactly! That is what I've been... nnnnngh."" Saying. What he'd been saying, and it had to end, didn't it? Eventually? Neville would have to let him come, surely.

""Just beg for it, Draco. Just a little begging..."" He leaned in, held still, and Draco just wanted a little more motion and to come

""No, no."" No, he was stronger than that, or he'd thought he was. Quite frankly, his pride was nearly worn down to nothing, and he wanted so badly to come. Wanted, and Draco drew in a deep, shuddering breath and moaned, fitfully. ""Please.""

Please, because he needed to come. Needed it like he needed to breathe, needed it like he needed magic running through his veins. It wasn't something he wanted.

It was something he had to have. It wasn't something he was going to get, he was fairly certain. Not anytime soon. Not until he was begging and desperate and cross-eyed from the endless pleasure.

If it weren't so amazing, he would kill Neville in his sleep. Thank goodness for Neville, it was, and he shifted again, making Draco moan. He thrust, a slow motion, and reached down to stroke at Draco's dick, tightening the spell on him.

It was going to be a very long weekend."
"all, Albus, I need to prepare classes fo-“

“Oh,” he says with wide eyes, “You thought- no, no, it’s my fault, I’m terribly sorry.”  Albus exhales heavily, as though the weight of the world is on his shoulders.  Minerva for one is almost positive it can’t compare to having the weight of a fifteen year old’s body around one’s shoulders. 

(In a manner of speaking.)

She takes the bait anyway, certain as she is that she’s not going to like the answer.  “What do you mean?”

He sighs.

Again.

“I can’t have my students taught by a fifteen year old girl, Minerva,” Albus tells her with a shake of his head.  “That would be irresponsible.”

“Even for you?” Minerva mutters with a sinking heart, thinking back to possessed turban-wearing weaklings, award-winning smilers, werewolves and crazy prison escapees.

(Lupin, Minerva acknowledges, was less a werewolf and more a cuddly teddy bear with a dark side of teeth and blood.  But still.)

“Yes, Minerva,” he says sharply with a hint of annoyance, “even, as you say, for me.”

“Well sh- wonderful – what am I expected to do, then?”

“Take a holiday, perhaps?  Unless…”

She doesn’t like the sound of that but steels herself.

“Unless…?”

She’s right, as it turns out.

 

~

 

This is so, so stupid, she thinks to herself as she signs the ridiculous and quite possibly illegal signup sheet for Potter and minions’ latest suicide attempt, trying not to admire the admittedly awe- spectacular Charms work that has gone into the whole thing.

 “Don’t you think it’s rather odd that there’s a transfer student?  And since when was there another wizarding school – that we haven’t even heard of – in Britain?” Granger says in a rather failed attempt of a hushed whisper to Weasley and Potter.  Minerva refuses to acknowledge that it is possibly evidence of the psychological impact of the potion that she finds Granger’s words annoying and obnoxious rather than insightful, and the fact that Granger is…

Never mind.

As Minerva watches out of the corner of her eye, Potter shrugs.  “Give her a chance, ‘Mione.  She’s been sorted into Gryffindor, she can’t be that bad,” he says patiently (obviously, if he has to deal with Granger with her bushy hair and regrettably straight teeth and Minerva really has no idea why all the guys seem to think she’s that-)

She winces, resists the urge to clutch too obviously at her head.

“Here, Mi- Hermione, wasn’t it?” Minerva says loudly, smiling at Potter as she shoves the piece of paper back at Granger.

It’s a grateful smile, she insists to herself, and she absolutely isn’t resisting the urge to bat her eyelashes at him like she hasn’t done since that bastard Riddle back in sixth year.

“Alright, everyone, today we’re going to be covering…”

Minerva is far too preoccupied with trying to remind herself that she’s past menopause, not sixteen, to actually listen to whatever it is that Harr- Potter is telling the students.

 

~

 

Even though it took Minerva all of about five minutes to determine the exact nature of Harry’s (Potter, he is still your student, Potter) suicide attempt for the year, she still finds herself going to those ridiculous meetings (and really, Dumbledore’s Army?  As though the man actually needs an army) and mouthing spells that she’d mastered by third year. 

She finds herself forced to admit sometimes that perhaps Albus was a little remiss in actually providing the students with competent teachers.

(Just a little.)

(Maybe.)

(And there is absolutely nothing appealing about the way Harry (goddamnit) frowns when he’s duelling.)

(And she’s definitely not sinking into the pits of adolescent mentality.)

 

~

 

Alright, perhaps she is.  But Harry’s got the most gorgeous green eyes – even Hermione thinks so, when she’s not too busy mooning after that moron Weasley – and honestly, she’s sixteen, she deserves to give herself a break.

(And she is really careful to ignore that frustrating little voice in the back of her head that keeps insisting that she’s more sixty than sixteen and should really not have gotten drunk – something about arteries, and their apparent importance – and made out with Ginny Weasley for five Sickles when classes finished for the Christmas holidays.)

 

~

 

Christmas is the best time of her life because that’s when it happens.

“Hey Minnie, um.” 

Harry shuffles from foot to foot as, wand still raised after barely remembering to actually speak the spell when she knocks out Ginny, Minerva looks up at him from under her eyelashes. She’s very careful not to bat them (yet) as she answers, “yes?  Is something wrong with my technique?” Eyelashes, flutter, now!"
"It had seemed like a good idea at the time.

Of course, Draco was fairly certain a lot of things could be described that way; he was also fairly certain that this idea had never actually been a good one, and his heart was in his throat as a result. Relaxing was going to be utterly impossible, no matter how many times Severus repeated that soft murmur.

""Just take a deep breath slowly."" He kept saying that, but Draco swore he could feel Severus's pulse in his ass, his spell-enlarged dick was so tightly squished inside of him.

Somehow, he managed to pull in a single shuddering gasp and then exhale it noisily, the sound a high-pitched whine. Fucking hell, it was... just huge. Severus had done it carefully, of course, but even so. It felt as though he'd been stretched beyond all reason, burned and stung, and fuck. Fuck, but Severus was fondling his cock, and the weight of it, the fantasy of it, the dark husky whisper of Engorgio Severus had given at the start of it, they almost made up for the hurt.

Almost.

He could feel every shift of motion, the way it pulled and pushed in with just bare breaths from Severus, struggling to hold still. ""You did ask for it bigger.""

""Yes, well. I have often wanted more than I could, in fact, handle."" So what if his voice cracked a bit, or if he couldn't stop clenching down on the width of it. Fuck, but the more Severus shifted, the bigger it seemed, and the more he stroked his cock, the more Draco thought he might explode just from the steady stretching pressure of it.

""It's not too much more than you can bear."" He shifted firmly, deliberately, then squeezed Draco's dick as if to stop him from exploding from the inside out.

The sound that broke from his lips was shameful, truly, but he couldn't stop it any more than he could stop the desperate squirm that got him utterly nowhere or the tremors that shook him. ""Please, Severus!"" Please what, he couldn't say.

Another slow half motion, more of a suggestion of fucking Draco than anything powerful. ""More, or less?""

Fuck. As if he knew. All he could manage was that whimper and writhing motion, and then Severus pushed forwards again and oh. Oh fuck. Oh, Merlin, that was. That was ridiculous, an explosion of pleasure that ripped through him, made him yell, and fucking god, he was going to die spitted on that cock. He was going to die screaming and covered in precome and sweat, because Severus gave him another stroke, squeezing firmly as he rocked his hips slowly backward.

He was fairly certain that he was gibbering with the force of it, nails scrabbling at the sheets, and he was never suggesting this again. Not ever, because his arse was never going to be the same.

He knew later that he'd marvel at the size of cock he'd taken, how large Severus had swelled out and stretched him, but in the moment it was all he could do to breathe, to ride it out as the sensation overwhelmed him. The world whited out in a wash of orgasm that shook him to his very core, pleasure ripping down to his bones so fast and so hard that he thought perhaps he had died from the sheer force of it.

When he managed to drag open his eyes, he was still lying face down, pillow nestled beneath his left ear, and he could still feel the twitch of his hole, slick and clamping and just... it felt huge. Draco whimpered, made a vague scrabble of his hand, and felt Severus's long fingers close around his own.

""Beautiful."" He squeezed firmly, and gave another luxurious thrust in that made Draco gasp raggedly. Merlin, that was... He was going to die before it was all over and done.

Whether from the size of it, or the pleasure, he wasn't entirely sure. ""Please...."" He wasn't even sure what was going on any longer, but he felt when Severus started to carefully shrink himself back to normal size, pulling out. It was an almost delirious relief, and the hand clutching his didn't let go. Thank Merlin. Oh, thank Merlin, and he shifted slowly, curling into Severus, luxuriating in the petting of long-fingered hands.

""Anything you want, Draco.""

Anything. That sounded just perfect."
"Hermione slammed her heavy satchel down on the bed, scattering schoolbooks and rumpling the freshly pressed sheets.  How could she just leave like that?  They had the whole afternoon planned.  She knew how much time Hermione had put into revising for her NEWTS, she knew they needed to spend some time alone, lost in thoughts of only each other, but she had gone anyway leaving Hermione alone with only her books again.

Damn Ron for needing to talk to her NOW!  Hermione wondered what kind of Weasley emergency he had conjured up this time.  Ron was having a difficult time with his sister’s sudden interest in his best friend, and he would stoop to almost any length to keep them from spending any time alone.  Hermione was beginning to get quite annoyed, but Ginny hadn’t even seemed to notice.

“Mum’s having a crisis over Fred and George’s latest antics Hermione, I have to go this time,"" Ginny had pleaded as she sat across from her girlfriend in the library.  “I can’t always leave Ron to deal with it, especially where Mum is concerned.""

Hermione pushed the books off the bed onto the floor as she remembered the conversation.  She didn’t usually treat her things so poorly, but right this minute she was not in the mood to be tidy.  Running her fingers through her wild curls, she sighed and lay back onto her soft pillow.  The sun shone through the window of the Gryffindor dormitory reminding her of the picnic they had planned by the forbidden forest. 

Her eyes fluttered closed and she smiled at the thought of Ginny laying beside her on one of Mrs. Weasley’s handmade patchwork quilts and she couldn’t stay angry with her.  The wind would tousle her soft red hair, the sun making her freckles even more prominent.  A soft sigh escaped Hermione’s lips as she imagined their tentative kisses and hesitant touches.    Everything still felt a little new to them, their relationship barely four weeks old, and both girls still marveled how those light caresses, and softly mumbled sentiments could quicken their heartbeats and leave them breathless so fast.

Without realizing it, Hermione’s hand had left her side and moved lightly across the front of her jumper causing her to jerk slightly as it brushed her nipple.  Warmth rushed through her body as she remembered the red haired girl’s feather soft fingers in the same place.  Her body’s reaction surprised her a little, but not enough to make her move her hand away. 

Ginny often took the lead in their lovemaking, and Hermione was happy to let the younger girl control things a little.  She thought about that now as she could almost feel Ginny’s silky tongue circling her obviously erect nipples, causing her to moan softly and her breath to quicken. 

Almost on their own accord, her fingers traveled slowly down to the waistband of her skirt as the heat of her body became more intense and she could feel the wetness begin to build between her thighs.  “Mmmm Ginny,"" she mumbled as her hand moved under her skirt and brushed just lightly over her cotton pants.  She could feel the dampness there and it surprised and excited her.

Hermione imagined Ginny’s long fingers lazily pulling back the soft material and sliding quickly inside.  Her own hand mimicked her thoughts, and the touch caused a jolt of raw feeling to pulse through the young girl’s body.  Giving no thought to the fact that someone could come strolling in at any moment; Hermione began to slowly rub her fingers over the now firm nub between her legs. 

She gasped as the wetness spread around her fingers and one slid inside her, causing her to lift her hips to meet the palm of her hand.  Her breathing had become ragged and her head felt foggy, but yet her body was reacting beyond her control.  She knew her climax was not far off, and she started a rhythm with her fingers and her hips that she knew would bring her there faster. 

Suddenly she was aware of hurried breathing in the room that wasn’t her own.  Was someone there?  A moment of panic washed over Hermione as she realized she was being watched, and that she was too close to orgasm to stop what she was doing.  Her eyes opened slowly, and she glanced over to the doorway of the girl’s dormitory.  What she saw made her breath catch in her throat, and her muscles contract around her fingers, bringing her to immediate climax. 

Ginny Weasley leaned against the doorway and moaned softly as her own passion overcame her, moving her fingers quickly under her grey skirt and keeping her eyes fixed directly on Hermione’s gaze.  Neither girl could break eye contact as together their breathing began to slowly regain its usual rhythm.

“I’m guessing you missed me,"" Ginny said softly, a silly grin widening across her rosy freckled face."
". Identical boys froze, looking for the source of the noise. When they found you in the gloom, there was even less movement. You eyed the one on the ground, George, critically. Whatever he was carrying was heavy... ""Is that for Charlie?""

George nodded slowly, thinking fast on how to talk his way out of being caught in the middle of a prank.

""Yeah, yeah, that's it! It's for Charlie!"" the one in the window, Fred, replied.

You smiled good-naturedly. ""Let me help you."" They nodded as you pulled out your wand and levitated the sack up and through the window.

""Excellent. Thanks!"" George grinned at you before taking off to a door that would permit him to enter the Burrow. Fred pulled up the rope and waved down at you. ""Have a good night!""

You waved back and leaned on the side of the house again. What nice brothers Charlie had, bringing his stuff to him. Although... as you thought about it, Charlie hadn't brought a sack like that with him... And why would it matter if he woke up...? You looked up at the closed window. What were the twins really doing up there?""



~*~

""Love the hair Charlie!"" one twin cackled.

Charlie pulled the strands into his line of sight and a vein throbbed in his temple. Nobody messed with Charlie Weasley's hair and got away with it. Not fire-breathing dragons and certainly not two younger brothers. He gritted his teeth and turned to the pair, ready to explode. Sensing the imminent danger, you piped in, ""It looks good.""

He turned to you and sighed. ""This is why I tend to avoid my family."" He shot the twins another glare before pulling out his wand.

""I wouldn't do that if I were you,"" the other twin snickered.

""Oh? Watch me,"" Charlie growled, touching the wand tip to his green hair.

With a large cloud of green smoke, Charlie's hair turned bright blue and grew another foot in length. Your mouth fell open as the twins burst into laughter. You were so out of there.



~*~

Confrontations were not your thing. Thus, even when you saw one of the twins heading out, broomstick in one hand, sack in the other, you didn't call out and confront him about what had happened. Charlie, however, had no such qualms. He opened the window and yelled at the twin. ""You'd better not come back any time soon George! When I catch you, you're as dead as Fred!"" He looked down at the top of your head. ""Same with you (Name). I can't believe you'd be so childish!"" You cringed as he slammed the window shut.

Now what were you going to do? Charlie had promised to take you sightseeing, but since he was mad at you, there was no way he would want to take you anywhere.

""(Name)!"" the twin Charlie had been yelling at called. You looked up in surprise. ""Want to come with?""

You nodded frantically; anything to get away from a miffed Charlie. When you caught up to him, he turned and led you towards an orchard in the distance.

""George, right?"" you asked tentatively. You were horrible with names and faces to begin with, so twins were always a nightmare.

He grinned at you. ""Correct.""

You offered a small smile in return. ""Where are we going?""

George tossed a bag to you. ""To practice Quidditch.""

""Where's your brother?""

""From the sounds of it, Charlie got him,"" George mused thoughtfully.

""Shouldn't you go help him?""

He laughed. ""And miss the chance to have the broom all to myself? Naw. He can handle big, bad Charlie by himself.""

You nodded absently as you slung the bag over one shoulder and continued to try and match pace with George. He was taller than you by a good six inches, so naturally his stride was longer.

""So you work with dragons?""

""Yes. The hatchlings.""

""It's hard to believe. You don't have any scars.""

It was your turn to laugh. ""Only careless people like Charlie receive scars. If a person pays attention all the time, there's nothing to worry about.""

""Huh.""

George set down the other bag he was carrying once the two of you had reached the middle of the orchard. He continued to hold the broom as he motioned for you to set down the bag he'd given you. ""You fly at all?""

You shook your head. ""I've only ever flown on dragons.""

""Want me to teach you?"" he asked, proffering the broom handle.

""I thought you needed to practice?""

George shrugged. ""Suit yourself."" Quickly and efficiently (with no long, complicated sentences you might have difficulty understanding), George explained what exactly he wanted you to do with the sack of balls on the"
"preferable to the female senses than armpit and crotch sweat, or so he’d been told on most occasions.   The sleepy little village felt peaceful, few lights still lit in the windows he passed, while he was wide awake and rarin’ to go, and a wicked smile played about his lips as he thought, She may be in bed, but she won’t be asleep this soon. We both expected the match to go on much longer.  Thus, as he came upon the newly renovated Potter household, the idea filled him to surprise his would-be-wife and proceed to ravish her to within an inch of their lives.  He shrunk both bottles then and slid them into a pocket, a quick, whispered sticking- and silencing charm muting any clinking that could occur. He checked to be sure the perimeter klaxon remained primed around the household and carefully toed his way through it, nudging this way and that past the wards using the field experience acquired during his brief stint as a curse breaker under Bill's guidance several years ago. In no time at all he was on his merry way, door gliding silently shut at his back, tiptoeing past the stairs to the upper floor and the bedroom adjacent it, and through the doorway into the kitchen.  He added two shrunken wine glasses, a bottle of powdered cherries and can of cream from the pantry, and a dish towel for cleaning up afterward into his pockets. Then he made his way around to the remodeled first floor bedroom, alohamora’d the bedroom door and swung it open, beaming, only to stop dead in his tracks at the sight that greeted him.  Ginny sat on the edge of their bed in her soft pink nightie, a gradually filling bucket between her spread legs, her hands wrapped around the finest set of udders he had ever seen on a feathered cow. “Oh!” she exclaimed between motions. The cow mooed distressingly, turning a shapely head that contoured more toward the avian than the grass-eater. Hard fiery blue eyes glared at him.   “Is that…"" a magical cow in our bedroom at a quarter to eleven, what kind of secret kink is this? He decided against blurting that out and asked instead, ""... what is going on?”  Ginny's nimble fingers resumed action, tugging on the fat udders. The cow mooed again rather moodily. ""I know you weren't expecting company, Harry. But she found me at the hospital at the end of my shift and I couldn't just leave her there, not after the ceremony."" Nonplussed at the situation, all he could do was stand there watching. She squeezed, another rich burst of milk gushing into the already too full bucket, and as a result over splash dashed across her pale legs from mid-thigh to ankle.   ""Oh. Dear, won't you lend a hand?"" Ginny reached down to wipe carelessly at the glistening milk with her fingertips, edge of her nightie jumping with the movement.  Harry felt his pulse do a little jig. Thank Merlin this isn't some mad fetish. This isn't the norm and I can get clearer answers later. ""Sure thing, Gin,"" he said.  He took out the towelette in one hand and his wand in the other, a few choice spells loosening his belt and slinging it over the nightstand. He vanished the contents of the bucket without much concern for where exactly it went. Then he knelt down, passed his fiancee the cloth, and took the nearest weeping teat into hand.  Ginny knew how to play her audience. She spread her legs further, leaned back to offer more light, lifted one leg up to better reach her sole, and with his emerald gaze burning intently on her every move Ginny wiped up the proxy for his cum. She smiled wickedly at the rising in his jeans, the rush of his breath, delighting that he was always so pliable after a hard match.  Harry's grip momentarily yanked instead of firmly pulled. In response, the cow's sturdy tail swung ‘round and clocked him on the side of the head. Harry winched at a blow to shame a bludger and lost his balance, stumbling backwards, his hands reaching out for the nearest available surface as he fell - which just so happened to be the front legs of the feathery bovine. His wand clattered somewhere to the side as it rolled away and the cow mooed in desperate protest.  Then they thudded to the floor together, and most of the air in his lungs exploded out in a violent, ""Oomph!"" of protest. But when Harry blinked opened his eyes he found those startlingly bright orbs up close and glaring at him from the hawkish lines of the creature's face, only scant inches over his own. So close that, had he not known better, he would have sworn on his godfather's grave that they really were human underneath.  Ginny stifled a laugh at his consternation. “Oh, Harry, how do you keep getting into these situations?”   He motioned desperately for Ginny’s assistance as he tried to no avail to push the cow up by physical force alone"
"the way the drink burned down his throat. He didn’t sit down until Voldemort did so and stared at him. “Are you uncomfortable, Mr Potter?”



Biting his lip, Harry shifted in his seat and nodded.



“Why?”



‘Because you could kill me without a word?’, ‘Because I’ve seen you Crucio your followers for looking at you wrong?’, ‘Because I have no idea what you want from me, and no one saw fit to tell me?’



Harry shrugged. “I don’t know.”



“I think you do, however it’s fine should you not wish to discuss it. I merely hoped to bring you more at ease.”



Voldemort’s smile came with a show of teeth, making Harry blurt: “Lulling me into a false sense of security?”



The smile instantly became more genuine. “There’s the Harry Potter I know,” the Dark Lord said. “I was afraid you’d lost that brilliant sense of defiance. It is as enlightening as the burning love you feel for those who care about you.”



Harry just stared at him. He never thought to hear something as startling as a compliment from Voldemort.



“I do admit I once wished to squelch those emotions until you were nothing more than a frightened mess,” Voldemort continued. “But now that I sense that trepidation in you, I find it to be quite alarming.”



When no response was forthcoming, Voldemort sighed. “I wish you well, Mr Potter.”



“Oh,” Harry said and took another sip of brandy. “Alright.”



“What was the nightmare about?”



Harry brought his feet up on his chair and hugged his knees to him. “It’s nothing,” he said. “Not really. I mean- It’s not like the fact that someone is out to kill me is a new thing, right?”



Voldemort didn’t respond to that last little jibe. “It’s most certainly not nothing if it keeps you up at night.”



Running a hand through his hair, Harry looked down at the floor. “It always starts with Dumbledore. He really would’ve killed me, you know. And then I think of all the people who gave their lives to see you stopped. Sirius and my parents. And in my dream they come at me, screaming at me that I’m an ungrateful brat. That they had the strength to lay down their lives, and I don’t.”



“One,” Voldemort said, beckoning Harry over. Harry didn’t move. “Your parents did not die to stop me. I killed them because they protected you. They died so you would live, so I cannot imagine they would want you to die now.



“Come here,” he said next. Harry reluctantly dropped his feet to the floor and stood up to stand awkwardly in front of the Dark Lord, who took one of his wrists and pulled the boy into his lap. Harry’s head came to rest against Voldemort’s bony chest.



“Two; Where I regained much of my sanity in the past few months, Dumbledore has sadly lost sight of the bigger picture.”



Harry thought over the words for a minute. “What are you saying?”



Voldemort stroked his long fingers through Harry’s hair. “People are happy, Harry. I wish it were safe for you to go out into the world and witness it with your own eyes. The monster Dumbledore has been fighting the past two decades no longer exists. Only he does not wish to recognize it.”


They spent most of the night talking, until Harry fell asleep, his head resting against Voldemort’s shoulder.


Harry wasn’t promiscuous in the least, but within a week they had shared their first kiss. A week later Harry moved into the Dark Lord’s rooms. He slept so much better when he wasn’t alone, when he was wanted.



Now Harry wasn’t sure he was wanted anymore.



Christmas morning was supposed to be perfect. Harry spent days on end trying to magically syphon his love into a small sphere. It wasn’t safe for him to go to Diagon Alley and shop for presents, and while he had no qualms about making a shopping list of presents for Voldemort’s elves, he wanted to take care of his love’s present himself.



The sphere would act like a protection charm, like the protection his mother had given him upon her death. It required true love of the purest kind.



Harry felt silly now, making Voldemort a present like that. It just showed how pathetic he really was, to fall for someone who didn’t reciprocate his feelings in the slightest.



This morning he was so happy, so excited to give Voldemort the charm, to see his face when Harry presented him with a token of his tremendous love. But the man had already left the bed and the manor by the time Harry woke up.



Still, he didn’t want to spend the night alone. Even if Voldemort’s passion was all he could hope for, Harry wanted it, wanted him."
"she needed and made her way into the bedroom where Lavender was waiting.

""Are you ready, sweetheart?""

Lavender smiled up at the young woman she loved.

""I've been ready for five years.""

Setting down her supplies on the bedside table, Parvati walked over and took Lavender into her arms.

""I've waited so long for this,"" she whispered, and kissed Lavender softly.

Curling her fingers around Lavender's, Parvati lead the other woman to the waiting bed. Parvati had taken the time earlier to drape the bedposts in red silk. Long ornate scarves with gold embroidery and tassels surrounded the bed, and the entire room was bathed in the glow from what seemed like a million tapered gold candles.

After gently laying Lavender down on the silk sheets, Parvati began to sing softly. There was no tune really, just a melodic chant, and the candles flickered just slightly as magic began to envelop the room.

As she sang, Parvati removed Lavender's clothes, pausing inbetween each piece of clothing to kiss lips, shoulders, stomach, thighs, carefully avoiding those places she knew would make Lavendar cry out. She would get there, but not yet, not until the song was complete.

Once Lavender was completely unclothed, Parvati stood and unwrapped the gauzy silk sari that covered her own naked body and loosened her long black hair from it's golden ties. Still chanting, she reached over to the bedside table for her quill and an ornately decorated porcelain bowl.

Lavender's eyes grew wide and Parvati knew her lover was wondering what the quill and bowl were for.

""Don't worry, love,"" Parvati whispered. ""It's just Henna. I altered it a little so it's not gritty and I can apply it with my quill.""

Lavender still looked a little confused so Parvati continued her explanation.

""Henna is used to stain the skin with intricate designs. It's considered lucky, and it's an Indian tradition for brides to use it to ornament themselves before marrying. Of course I changed the properties a little so it does a little more than just that.""

Parvati smiled at her final words. Lavender was in for an amazing experience if what Parvati had spelled the Henna to do worked correctly.

Lavender visibly relaxed at Parvati's words, so Parvati dipped the quill lightly into the bowl and paused to let any excess Henna drip back down the sides. Starting at the left side of Lavender's long neck, Parvati began to draw. The quill dipped and danced in circles over Lavender's skin as Parvati worked her way down over the blonde woman's round breasts. Lavender let out an audible sigh as the quill circled her nipples, leaving a reddish-brown spiral in it's wake.

Continuing down across Lavender's flat stomach, Parvati twirled the quill and chanted, covering Lavender's body in ornate designs stopping momentarily, just short of the mound of soft blonde curls between Lavender's thighs.

Lavender's moans were becoming louder and more frequent. Parvati knew the spell was beginning to take affect. She sang as she worked, gently caressing the top of the quill over Lavender's thighs and knees, down to the curve of her ankles. The last few words of the chant were the most important, and Parvati's voice rose in octave as finished the last of the designs ending just before the pink toenails on Lavender's tiny feet.

Reaching for her wand, Parvati whispered the final spell, causing the Henna trail to glow in the candlelight. She knew that as the Henna burned painlessly into Lavender's skin, every nerve ending in the other woman's body would be on fire. Within moments, Lavender was arching her hips calling out Parvati's name in breathless gasps. Parvati could feel her own body responding to the spell and the sight as the identical pattern she had just painstakingly created on Lavender's body replicated itself on her own.

Gazing down into her lover's eyes, Parvati could see the heavy-lidded passion and knew she couldn't wait any longer. Kneeling over Lavender's thighs, Parvati quickly thrust two dark fingers into Lavender's hot entrance and began to move. The wet heat travelled straight to Parvati's own core and she heard herself cry out with the intensity of the spell.

Lavender's orgasm was almost immediate and watching her sent a stream of shivers straight down Parvati's spine. Parvati carefully lifted herself over to Lavender's side and caressed Lavender's hair as her lover came down from her orgasmic high.

""You look incredible,"" Parvati whispered, taking in the glorious sight in front of her. Lavender's body was bathed in golden light which reflected the intricate patterns on her pale skin.

Lavender smiled softly.

""That was amazing, love.""

Parvati leaned in to kiss Lavender gently, but her own release was still imminent causing the kisses to become heated and urgent. She soon found herself pressing insistently against Lavender's thigh, the friction setting off thrills of pleasure through her dark skin, the spell giving every movement even more intensity"
"cut him off. ""You know what you did, Dumbledore! 'For the Greater Good,' wasn't it? No more. Don't try your befuddled old man act on me any longer.""

Professor McGonagall stood then. ""Mister Potter, what is the meaning of this?!"" She shouted. ""You can't possibly-""

The Boy Who Lived raised a glowing sapphire. ""Silence, Minerva."" He snapped his wrist once, and McGonagall fell senseless, the sapphire glowing even more sinisterly for an instant.

Dumbledore's benign smile vanished. Harry smirked back.

""No more blandishments about my mother's love, Dumbledore? Maybe you can send me to live with the Dursley's again. Oh wait,"" Harry's smirk grew wider. ""I killed them already. My real family aren't a bunch of muggles. They weren't even the Potters.""

""Harry, please."" Dumbledore said. ""It is not too late to change things.""

""The only changes we'll have today is your end."" Harry shot back. ""Harry Potter is dead. Call me... Harry Arcturus Neverborn Extremis Black!""

The other students in the hall began muttering among themselves. A few snickered at Harry's new name.

""Now,"" Harry said. ""Will you fight me, Dumbledore? Or will you lay down and die?""

He pocketed the glowing sapphire and raised a new magical artifact. A demon's sword, heritage of his true father. Forged in the flames of a nonspecific, probably vaguely Judeo-Christian Hell. Baptized in the blood of Harry's Veela mother and tempered with angel's tears. The blade did not glow. No, it was filled with unlight. The hall grew darker for its very presence.

Dumbledore sighed. ""I see. If it must be this way... Mister Black, then it shall be. However..."" Dumbledore paused for a moment, stroking his beard. ""May I inquire if that is the particular demon sword that was sealed away in-""

Harry interrupted him again. ""Yes! In the ruins of my father's home- the Iron Death Ice Fortress! My birthright, but for your interference!""

""I see."" Dumbledore's smile returned.

""What?"" Harry snarled. ""You dare smirk at High Overlord Black?!""

Dumbledore raised his hands defensively. ""Oh no, Mister Black. I was just thinking of the last time I saw that sword.""

""When you banished my father and usurped my-""

This time it was Dumbledore who interrupted. ""And I suppose that you read the book of spells sealed with it?""

""Yes, but-""

""And you did the accompanying rituals?""

""Yes!"" Harry shouted triumphantly. ""Even the Dark Rite of Fakshite!""

""Ah."" Dumbledore's smile grew a little wider. ""Well then, stop me if you've heard this one.""

Dumbledore snapped his long fingers once, and then spoke a single word.

""Hubris.""

At once, Harry's sword snapped in two. The pieces rusted into nothing in a matter of moments. The High Overlord Black found himself suddenly dizzy, barely able to stay standing. His new-found power deserted him in seconds; most of his magical trinkets fading and falling to pieces. Dumbledore simply stood there, still smiling benignly.

""Tell me, Mister Black, did you ever wonder what I was doing all these years as Headmaster?"" Dumbledore chuckled. ""You think you're the first special boy to come to Hogwarts? Oh no. It must be every decade or so that one of my students gets it into his head that he could do a better job. Tom Riddle was only the latest. Or... second latest, if we count you.""

""What?!"" Harry gasped. ""But what about the Greater Good and all that?""

""The Greater Good?"" Dumbledore shook his head pityingly. ""I move our society towards the-"" Dumbledore made air-quotes, ""Greater Good, with every student who passes through our doors. A proper education and good friends are worth more to wizard kind than any magical rituals or silly artifacts.""

""And the Sword of Greater Deathbane?"" Harry said. The weight of his artifacts grew too much and he fell to his knees. Around him, students were finally backing away, deserting their spots at the long tables like rats deserting a sinking ship.

""Planted."" Dumbledore said. ""As was the Ritual of True Ascension, the Jewel of Grinding Souls, and most every other mysterious artifact you can think of. I wasn't sitting on my laurels this whole time, oh no."" Dumbledore snapped his fingers once more, and one by one, Harry's remaining items crumbled away into dust.

""You really should have listened to Miss Granger some more,"" Dumbledore chided. ""She'd have known that you can't be half-demon, vampire, veela, and whatever other silly races you've filled in the blanks with at the same time.""

""Ah bollocks."" Harry swore.

Dumbledore nodded. ""Yes."" He drew himself up;"
"leading him to the one he wished to find.

A shimmering purple dress, blond hair… it had to be Luna Lovegood. Why did he have to dance with her, of all people? Although he had to admit, it was very much like him to choose someone unpopular and a bit odd as a partner. Half to avoid suspicion, half because he felt she was a kindred soul or something like that. Yes, he always liked to say such nonsense.

His deep green and gold mask was glistening in the low light, hiding his scar and his beautiful green eyes. Most of his face was hidden – Tom had made sure of that when he had it custom made – but he would never mistake another for him. Even if he had not known every inch of his lover’s face so well it vividly haunted his vision day and night, the small bite marks just under his collar were a complete giveaway.

The couple in front of him was spinning around slowly, not dancing too closely like some of the others around them. It was obvious they were not flirting or even remotely attracted to each other as anything more than friends. Then why did he feel such a powerful wave of jealousy? He wanted to twist her pale little arms until they snapped. He wanted to pull out all of her hair. Burn that shimmering dress. Why did he have to be surrounded by so many teachers and students, unable to act at once?

This simply would not do. Not at all.


Lord Voldemort does not share. 


 

*

 

Luna smiled at Harry.

“It was lovely of you to ask me to the party, Harry,” she said dreamily, twirling around in his arms to the music. Her face was hidden behind a yellow and sparkly mask, but behind it, her eyes were staring at him, wide open. He always felt like she could see right through him.

“It’s my pleasure,” he replied politely, letting the corner of his lip lift up slightly. “I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.”

They danced somewhat awkwardly for a bit, never getting too close to each other. Before the song even finished, Luna was pulled away for the next dance by a tall, somewhat bulky boy with a pale grey mask.

Harry’s stomach seemed to flip and clench dangerously when he realised that it was most likely Nott, an older Slytherin and one of his followers. They made the strangest couple ever, Luna dressed in a bright dress and walking with a skip in her step and Nott, stiffly following her lead with hunched shoulders as though he’d rather be anywhere else on the planet.

He wasn’t given time to go rescue Nott from his overly enthusiastic companion, when a pair of strong arms wrapped themselves around him from behind.

“Hello,” said a deep, soothing voice right in his ear. “Dance with me?”

Harry did not immediately turn around. He allowed himself to be pulled closer, feeling the soothing touch of his Horcrux in the ring hidden underneath his captor’s gloves. His familiar scent enveloped Harry and he smiled, finally turning around to face the man behind him.

His gaze fell upon the smooth, perfect lips of his lover which he had senselessly kissed in abandon all too long ago, during a few stolen moments in a broom cupboard. His body reacted to his lascivious thoughts accordingly and he pressed himself even closer to him, burying his face in the man’s loose black cloak.

“Tom,” he whispered, his voice trembling with need and grabbing onto his waist firmly. He heard his lover chuckle pleasantly.

“Missed me?”  the Slytherin almost purred, letting his hands travel down Harry’s body and place themselves in the pockets of his trousers.

“Shut up!” he retorted in frustration. They never had the time to sneak out to meet anymore, not since Tom had made Head Boy at the start of the school year. Once every two weeks really wasn’t enough.

“Shh, love,” Tom whispered. “We can’t be recognised, remember?”

“I know,” Harry scowled into the dark material, but he knew his lover could tell anyway. He always did, somehow. Maybe it was another side effect of the scar he’d given Harry two years prior, when he stumbled into the girl’s bathroom on the second floor by accident. Tom tried to kill him, but the curse rebounded, seriously hurting them both. Harry was left with an odd, lightning shaped scar which seemed to act up whenever Tom was feeling extreme emotions. He also started to be able to speak Parseltongue and afterwards, Riddle trailed after him all the time to make sure he wouldn’t spill to any teachers about what he was doing and that he had tried to kill Harry. They had somehow fallen in love after that, initially driven by lust for each other, which then turned into something deeper when Tom came to save him from his abusive muggle uncle.

“Dance with me?” his lover asked, pulling Harry along as he moved to the slow music. It didn’t take long for the"
"end of the bed fully dressed with his arms crossed over his chest. It made Draco want to hiss because that, the way he stood, it was one of the ways that turned him on the most. Just seeing him like that made him hard, made him weak in the knees, made him want to do whatever he was told, and so he obeyed. The wood of the headboard was rough, but he managed somehow to wrap his hands around it and hold on.

""Yes, sir.""

""Good."" He circled to the side of the bed, and idly dragged a hand over Draco's chest, like he was checking dried herbs for dryness. He panted his way through it, aching, almost unable to bear that single, steady touch. The idea of it continuing seemed difficult, impossible, he didn't know what, and yet.

And yet.

""Tell me what that feels like."" He repeated the gesture, expression schooled, no hint to Draco of what he wanted except compliance.

That was going to be the most difficult thing; obeying, when everything felt... so much. Too much, and he whined, licking his lips again before managing to pull himself together enough to speak. ""Strong."" His voice was hoarse. ""Too... too much. I can feel everything.""

""More. What does too much feel like?"" His fingers strayed from bored stroking, to tweak Draco's left nipple tightly. He couldn't stop himself from whimpering, his hands tightening on the headboard, and he panted his way through it, unsteady aching breaths that made him, made him.. he didn't know.

There was only one word for it. ""Overwhelming. Too much. Too much, it's..."" He couldn't keep back the little sounds, whines and whimpers, pleading noises. ""Oh. Sir!""

""Shhh. Tight hold on that headboard. I'm going to fuck a new hole into you before this is all done, and I want you to think about every moment, every touch."" He stepped back, stopped touching Draco entirely, and started to slowly unbutton his robes.

Oh, fuck. Maybe he even said as much, and he wanted to stop. He wanted to say no, and yet he also wanted to do as he was told. Conflicting desires were nothing new in Draco's world, but this terrified him just a bit. Maybe even quite a lot, because just the shift and touch of velvet prickling against his skin made him want to yell. The idea of stretching around Severus's dick...

Fuck.

""Be quiet for a moment,"" he goaded gently, setting his outer robe aside carefully, before starting at his shirt.

Quiet. Quiet, quiet, and he had to bite down on his lip to even begin, and that. That was, it hurt. It hurt, brought tears to his eyes, made Severus fuzzy just to see, but he managed it. Somehow.

Barely.

""You can make noise now,"" he granted as he stepped back closer to Draco, naked again, and it broke from him in a rush, little whimpers and sounds, nothing he could hold back given permission. With the first touch of a hand brushing against him, he moaned and tried to arch away from it, fingers just barely retaining their hold on the slats.

""If you let go, I stop,"" Severus reminded him, shifting, sliding his hand down to Draco's hip.

He wanted him to stop. Wanted it to be over, and he didn't, because he wanted... more than anything, he wanted to please. He wanted to feel, and he felt everything, too much, so much, and maybe he was saying it, maybe he was begging for it, hot and the stinging in his eyes could be tears or sweat. He couldn't be sure. ""Please. Pleasepleaseplease.""

""Shhhh. I'm making this quick, and it feels like forever, doesn't it?"" He was smiling as he asked it, wrapping fingers around Draco's dick.

Forever, eternity, and his entire body slammed upwards, and that. That sound, it couldn't be him, that sound. It was too much, far too much, and he was begging, pleading desperately, and he didn't know if he could bear it.

""Remember."" It was hard to remember what he even needed to remember, but he clenched his fingers, rough wood under his palms as Severus knelt on the bed, wand in hand.

All he had to do. All he had to do was obey. Obey, and keep holding on, and he wasn't sure what the reward for that was, not really, or maybe he just couldn't remember it, and then he screamed because that was. That was much too much, magic like electricity and he thought that he wouldn't be able to do it. Couldn't, but Severus wanted him to, and that as much as anything seemed to"
"company of friends who made her laugh. 

It began to rain just as they reached the main street of the village, so they ducked into Honeydukes to while away the time until Andromeda was supposed to meet Ted. Andy bought candy to send to her young cousins - Peppermint Toads for Sirius, Chocolate Frogs for Regulus - and a packet of toffees for herself. 

The downpour had slowed to a drizzle by the time they left, and with the hoods of their cloaks pulled up they hurried down the street towards The Three Broomsticks, dodging puddles and trying not to slip on the wet cobblestones. As they neared the entrance to the pub, Andy recognized the four figures sheltering in the doorway: Ted, Edgar, Alice, and Frank. Ted wore Muggle clothing, as he usually did in his leisure time. His dark grey coat highlighted his broad shoulders far better than a cloak would have, and untidy wisps of blond hair stuck out from
under his knit cap. When he spotted her at last, his face lit up with one of those dazzling smiles that never failed to make Andy smile, too. 

Edgar had noticed them, too. “Ruth! Delia! Anwen!” he called, waving them down. Ted’s best friend was a handsome boy with reddish-brown hair and an aquiline nose, shorter than Ted and usually more serious. Today, however, he looked downright cheerful. “Care to join us? Alice needs new quills, so we’re going to stop in at Scrivenshaft’s. Give these two some time to themselves.” He nudged Ted, grinning, and Ted’s cheeks - already pink from the cold - turned red.  

“Alright,” Anwen said, “but I want to go to Spintwitches, too. I’m nearly out of broom handle polish.” She took Delia’s hand and bounded forward to join the others. Ruth followed them, turning to wave to Andromeda before falling into step with Edgar, and soon the whole group passed beyond the building and out of sight. 

Ted and Andromeda looked at each other for a moment, then Ted opened the door of the pub and held it open for her with an elaborate bow. “After you,” he said in the stuffiest accent he could manage. Andy giggled, then stepped into the noisy warmth of the pub.  

She went to the bar and ordered two Butterbeers, paying for them both before he could protest. What was the point of being from a wealthy family if you didn’t treat your friends? The knowledge that her parents would probably both drop dead from shock if they knew that their most marriageable daughter was going on a date with a Muggle-born would only make the drink taste sweeter. 

The Three Broomsticks was packed with students and townsfolk alike, but they found an empty table in a back corner, far enough from the center of the room to give them some semblance of privacy. Andy took off her damp cloak and shook out her hair, and Ted’s eyebrows rose. 

“You look nice, ‘Dromeda,” he said. Ted had been dropping the first syllable of her name for years, both to tease her and as a gesture of affection, but now hearing it in his deep voice made Andy blush. “Muggle clothes suit you.” 

She twirled around, showing off, feeling triumphant when she made him laugh. “The skirt is Ruth’s,” she admitted, grabbing the back of her chair to steady herself and sitting down. 

Ted removed his coat and hat and joined her. “Still, lose the cloak and you’d fit right in at one of my Mum’s parties. She’d love that sweater. You should come to Easter dinner, I’m sure you’d be a hit - my parents are always on about how I should bring my school friends to visit more often.” 

“I wish I could,” Andy said, imagining what her parents would say if she told them she wanted to spend a holiday at a Muggle house. “Your family sounds awfully nice, Ted.” 

He must have caught the wistful note in her voice, for the laughter in his face turned quickly to sympathetic concern. “Bellatrix still not speaking to you?” 

Andy shook her head, staring down into her mug. She hadn’t meant to talk about her family troubles on their first date, but Ted knew plenty about it already, and he was such a good listener.

“She’s barely said two words to me since I refused to stop spending time with you and Ruth,” she murmured. “Whenever we pass each other in the corridors she looks at me like I’m something nasty she just scraped off her shoe. Narcissa will still speak to me if we’re alone and I talk to her first, but when she’s with Bella or her friends she just walks by me like I’m not there. My own sisters.” Andy sniffled, trying to blink the tears out of her eyes. “I’m sorry, Ted, I didn’t mean to get so upset.” 

Ted rummaged in his coat pocket, pulled out a handkerchief,"
"have used it. Maybe then, some of his friends would have survived the First War…

Voldemort looks at him like he’s grown another head. Oh, yeah, he spaced out a little. Overdosing on magic enhancing potions tended to do that. Got a little high sometimes….

“So are you going to kill me now?” he asks with a smirk. The Dark Lord should be happy enough to acquiesce.

“Should I?” Voldemort drawls and puts away his wand instead. Harry gapes and then, after a moment, realises there is a pressure on his mind. Damn it, he’d forgotten all about using Occlumency – hadn’t needed to in years. Muggles aren’t exactly skilled in the mind arts after all, and who else did he have to hide from when they were all dead?

“Damn,” he breathes, but  within moments, decides that he doesn’t actually care. He’d jumped into the Veil prepared to die. Whatever happened now… wouldn’t change anything.

Voldemort takes several moments to look him over. Harry can feel the magic crackling around them and marvels at the feeling or wholeness it brings him. He even marvels at how he’d been stupid enough not to notice it until it was far too late. They could have done such great things together…

The Dark Lord paces around Harry, who is still sprawled out on the floor lazily. He’s watching him carefully, intimately and calculatingly. Every step, something new is decided and Harry knows the fate of this world, of a different future, is decided.

“This isn’t the first time you’ve been here,” Voldemort murmurs, fascinated. Harry just blinks up at the man uncomprehendingly.

“Magic is… timeless,” Voldemort says, sensing his curiosity. Harry’s mind is wide open, though he doesn’t have the strength or the motivation to shield it either way. “It always leaves traces. No matter how much the timeline has been distorted, there will always be traces.

“You’ve been here before, in a different past and a different future. Your indecision and inability to do what is necessary have always brought you back right… here.”

Harry mulls this over in his head for several moments. Really, he just feels tired. He’s had the fate of the world on his shoulders for what feels an eternity, but now he really doesn’t give a flying fuck. He’d tried saving the Muggles, but they’d destroyed themselves and the world around them in the process. Like cancer, they’d spread and burned through every last spark of good in the world until life everywhere had been extinguished. The Wizards weren’t much better. They were selfish and overconfident. They’d spurned the Muggles into action, driving and feeding the flames of their fear. No matter what he’d do, no matter how hard Harry would try…

“Harry, look at me,” Voldemort commands, almost kneeling in front of him. The cool, crimson eyes are a familiar, soothing sight for Harry’s confused, tired mind. “There is another way.”

There is a silence.

“Remember, under the dungeons of Hogwarts, I told you that together we could accomplish anything?” Harry nods numbly, trying to push away the pain these thoughts bring him. Ron, Hermione, Ginny… they all died, torn apart by Muggle weapons. “I did not lie to you. You can still change the future, avoid the inevitable and carve your own path…”

It’s terrifyingly charismatic and Harry wants to believe him. He wants this sliver of hope to hang on to, but it’s too good to be true. He’s scared of losing everything again. Years of fighting and losing had turned him into a wreck, a coward and a liar. If only Dumbledore could see him now!

Voldemort is calm, collected, compelling. The speech sounds almost rehearsed and Harry feels the drop in his gut when he realises that it’s probably because he has said it many times before. How many times? How many times had Harry chosen to condemn the world due to his own unreasonable apprehension to the man who had taken so much from him? The thought makes him shudder. He used to hate Voldemort… no, he thought he had. Hate, strong and consuming, had been unknown to him all those years, until he saw Wizards stripped of their powers, burned from the inside out by their own bodies, unable to cope. He had hated Muggles then. Voldemort’s coldblooded, although relatively humane by comparison, murder of his parents had faded in his mind. He had not known his parents. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, Neville, countless others… he’d known them and seen their last, suffering moments as they begged for mercy.

If he had a chance, however slim, to prevent the slaughter of the people he loved…. He would… Harry strangled the thought right there. He told himself, it would all be over now. He"
"swift Finite, looking around at the few scattered implements he still had to put away in his trunk. ""Yeah, Draco?"" he called back as he strode over to the door and pulled     it open. The Malfoy heir stepped in after a moment and looked around   the   rather small guest bedroom, as if seeking something. ""I  see you haven't gotten the train ticket anywhere in sight- which is   good to   see you've remembered- only you haven't gone and misplaced it,   have   you?"" he asked rather haltingly all at once. Harry  recognized it as faint anxiety, and it was good to know that he     wasn't the only one. ""No, I packed it away with most of my books a   month   ago."" He answered. Draco nodded.

""Alright,  then. Breakfast is ready and mother said to  have   everything packed  up beforehand, so we can head out at ten  o'clock   sharp."" His gaze  lingered on the items sticking out like sore  thumbs. Harry nodded in turn.

""Thanks, Draco. I'll be down in a minute."" He    responded and turned  to rush over to his trunk. Draco sighed at the loss    of proper stance  and the haste of his sort-of-cousin- the books were    rather vague and  the Wizengamot hadn't clarified in easily digestible    terms. At best, it was Draco's own mother that was Harry's nearest-cousin,   just   as it was Harry's godfather that was his own nearest-cousin. What  they were might not even technically count by law given the distance between their respective branches. Whatever the case was, however, they were still relatives, and Draco     respected that and the effort Harry was making to adapt to their way of     life. He waited until the last book and the clock were set  nearly-neatly into    the trunk at the foot of the bed and then shut  before he stepped up  to   help drag the lumbering weight down the  stairs with him. Harry smiled gratefully.

 

 

 

Apparition was among the worst sensations Harry thought he would ever    encounter. He gasped and nearly collapsed to the ground when they    arrived on the platform, shrunken trunk in pocket.

Draco helped to steady him even though his own eyes were wide and  nearly   stunned from the feeling. It was unlike the effect Dobby had  used,   though still near enough for him to have gotten used to. It  seemed Harry   had no such stomach or fortitude for that method of  travel.

Lucius and Narcissa helped prod them along and through the stone  barrier  onto Platform 9 3/4ers a few moments later, where several other  earlier  arrivals were standing around chatting.

""Now, Mister Potter, I believe that there is but one further thing in   which you must acquire."" Lucius stated calmly, calling out for the   semi-useless house-elf a few moments later.

Dobby appeared instantly,   bowing and kissing the hem of his masters robes, nearly to the disgust   of said wizard if the sneer on his face was much to go by.

""Take this sack of gold and select two of the finest Owls in Diagon   Alley for purchase. I expect it to take no more than fifteen minutes-   and ensure you acquire the other items required for proper care and   ownership. Go!"" He ordered after drawing out the same small red velvet   sack of Galleons and Sickles that Draco had used at Madam Malkins a   month  prior.

Hesitantly Dobby reached up to accept the gold and silver before  sparing  the two boys a quick glance and vanishing far more quietly now  than  before. Harry watched the creature go with a feeling of pity.

""Seeing as we are very nearly upon the train and toward Hogwarts  itself,  I trust that you two may entertain yourselves enough to pass  the  remaining time easily. Before much longer the rest of them will  arrive,  and I unfortunately have a job to perform- your mother shall  convey all  the sympathy and such necessary for the both of us. Good  luck, Draco,  Mister Potter."" Lucius told them simply and rested a hand  on either of  their shoulders for a moment, lingering more upon his own  childs before  disapparating just as quietly as Dobby had managed.

Harry felt heat rushing into his face at the touch and partial-kindness   of the act, and he smiled without realizing it. ""Well, come on then,   Potter, lets find somewhere to duel and make sure we can show the other   brats a thing or two,"" he said confidently, completely at ease now and   not nervous in the slightest about performing even more  technically-illegal magic at that point.

Harry nodded a little bemusedly and trotted after him as Narcissa   conjured a seat all to herself and drew an envelope from her pockets to   peruse again.

A short time later and things began to pick up quickly.

Dobby delivered a  magnificent black eagle-owl whose name was to be  decided by Draco,  along with its gilded golden cage and the finest owl  treats available,  while a slightly less majestic tawny and black dotted  owl looking rather  like a transfigured leopard sat within a paler  white cage for Harry  himself.

""M-masters owls, Ma'am,"" the house elf told Narcissa quietly and set  the  cages down. She barely looked up"
", safe little fantasy!

""Drove. It's a rental but... What do you do?"" He set the glass down, and stood up with Draco. ""It's a sports car, though. Even if I can't really open it up on the streets around here.""

""Perfect."" It was remarkable, the way Severus was going all out. Just thinking about it made Draco feel warm somewhere in his chest. He wiped a hand over spotless black pants and headed for the door just ahead of... Well.

His 'stranger'.

Once they were on the street, the man led the way towards a very well kept looking red Muggle car, the sort they always seemed so proud of. It was stereotypical enough of Muggles to make Draco smirk as the man held the passenger side door open for him. He slid inside and breathed in deeply, the familiar scent of leather and distinctly unfamiliar smells of plastic and cleaning solutions mingling pleasantly. ""Oh, lovely,"" he purred to himself as his 'stranger' walked around the bonnet before climbing behind the wheel. ""Take a left. It's six blocks down, a new street.""

""Every time I come to this city, there's five or ten new streets."" He was following directions well, though. Driving Muggle vehicles seemed so very over complicated to Draco, and Severus had blended in with them seamlessly. He had never understood how he managed it, but it was entertaining, at the very least, and extraordinarily helpful as well.

""Oh, I can hardly find anything. All of the streets seemed to be named some form of fruit, from what I can tell."" Draco watched as the car slid through the dark, streetlights providing the occasional bright splotch along the way. ""Here, turn at the next street.""

""Got it. Yeah, I've noticed that. I've gotten lost about ten times just getting here from the airport."" Airports, god. Draco didn't even want to consider that absurdity, because cars were already absurd enough. Muggles certainly made do with their circumstances, but airplanes were too much.

He glossed over any reply to that and said, ""Second house, on the left."" The light was on outside as well as a few lights inside. If he hadn't known better, he'd have thought he saw Severus's silhouette against the dining room drapes.

That was just absurd, his eyes playing tricks on him while the man pulled smoothly into the driveway and turned the car off. ""Nice place.""

""Very. The neighbors are..."" Completely psychotic, in some cases, Draco was certain. He suspected that Mr. Angeles was a serial killer in hiding. ""...incredibly charming.""

""Somehow I don't think that's what you wanted to say,"" the man laughed, grinning sideways at him while they started up the walk to the stairs at the front door.

""Somehow, I think you are correct,"" Draco agreed. He tugged a keychain from his pocket and paused to unlock the door. It was a strange sort of custom, much less charming than one's door knowing one and opening automatically. ""So."" He turned. ""I'm sure you'd love to see my...."" Wait. They were pretending to be Muggles. Offering his potions lab wasn't the thing. ""...well. Whatever you'd like to see, actually, I'm sure we can find it.""

""Etchings?"" The man's eyebrows  waggled at him. ""If you want to, sure, but I'd rather just..."" He moved in close to kiss Draco, backing him up against the foyer wall. That was nice, more forceful than Severus normally was, and he moaned into the kiss, shivering with the pleasure of it.

Delicious.

Forceful and different, appealing in its own way.  He held him there, kissed him hard, and leaned in to grind his crotch against Draco's. God, that was good, and he groaned, slipping his arms around those broad shoulders and using Seeker's balance to draw himself up harder against him. He might not spend time on a broom that much anymore, but some skills were thankfully natural.

Extremely useful when things got so very different from what he was used to getting with Severus. He liked it, though, this new roughness, hands cupping his ass tightly and hitching him in closer. ""Fuck, yes.""

Giving a breathless grin, he cocked his head to the side. ""Shall we find a bed or is here in the hall good enough?""

""A bed's good, but I can do a lot with a little,"" the man enthused, taking a step down the hall, just one, with Draco half wrapped around him. Merlin, that was awesome, too.

Reaching between them, Draco managed to get a hand wriggled between that flat belly and the waistband of his pants, earning himself a delicious sound. ""Clearly you have more than a little to work with,"" he offered breathlessly.

""Hah, there"
"tingling sensation at his spine. “So what stopped you?” he asked defiantly.

Lucius sighed. “What good would it do me, if I cannot go beyond the wards of this hovel? Your little friends would take one look at your dead body and lynch me before the Aurors could arrive.”

“You tested the wards,” Harry said flatly. “And I’m only alive because you couldn’t break them.”

He saw Lucius’s eyes darken as he lowered his head slightly and curled up his upper lip.

“Could you even blame me? Leopards don’t change their spots, Potter, it is you who should have been more careful. But no harm done, you were once again lucky.”

Harry shook his head, turned on his heels and left the kitchen. He wasn’t hungry anymore.

He couldn’t let Lucius win though, not if he wanted to maintain the status quo. He was master of this house. He’d be the one who made the rules. Only he would decide what was and was not acceptable behaviour.

When Lucius had asked for clothes the night before, Harry had briefly considered buying him a new wardrobe in Diagon Alley. It would even be the quality clothing befitting a Malfoy, a sort of ‘thank you’ for his gentle treatment during the bonding.

Harry rushed up the stairs for the fourth floor. He’d stripped and changed almost the entire house over the summer, but he’d left the top floor the way it had been when Sirius was alive. The one door still read SIRIUS, but it was the other door he pushed open.

Kreacher had taken almost everything in his despair, holding on to his dead master’s favourite items. Luckily he’d left Regulus’s wardrobe alone, and it was filled with soft silks and rich cottons. The designs were dated and the colours faded by time, but high quality nonetheless.

Harry folded enough of them into a rough pile to last a week, and stuffed them under his left arm. He was not going to let himself be lulled into a false sense of security again. Lucius was a Slytherin, and he had years of experience over Harry.

He held onto the railing as he rushed downstairs, sliding down the last two steps, almost falling flat on his ass.

Lucius wasn’t on the third floor, so he quickly dropped the pile of second hand clothes on the bed in the smallest bedroom, and retreated to his own room on the first floor. Maybe space and time wasn’t what he needed. Maybe he just needed to pick up his life where it had left off before Malfoy.



 




Lucius stayed out of his way as requested. He only showed up for dinner, after which he grudgingly took up a scrub sponge. They didn’t really speak at the dinner table, apart from Harry’s polite ‘good evenings’. At least, not until Saturday.

“Potter,” Lucius said. “I’d like to be permitted to use the Black Library.”

Harry looked up from his meat and two veg, only to see the unreadable expression Lucius always wore on his face.

“Uhm, no,” he replied and took another bite of carrots.

“I will not spend my days in my room, waiting for one to blend into another, boy. I have read that book on Magical arts and crafts seven times already. And let us not even mention the fact that I have no interest in crocheting Charms to start with,” Lucius couldn’t hold back the indignation from showing through his iron mask.

Harry smiled to himself. So that was what that book had been about.

“That’s all very well, but I’m not allowing you into a library that’s filled with a million ways to cause mayhem without a wand,” Harry replied, staring into the distance for a minute, his fingers resting on his bottom lip. “I will pick some books for you to read.”

“Magnificent,” Lucius muttered. “How I look forward to sampling your literary palette.”

“I do promise there will be no books on magical knitting or embroidery.”

The glare Lucius shot at Harry only made him chuckle lightly.



 




He owled Draco.

The reply was a rather large package, heavy too, if the way the black owl was struggling with it was any indication.

When Harry opened it, it proved to be a small stack of books on topics varying between English Poetry, Scottish Deerhounds and Rose-Breeding.

It came with a short note:

“I’ll be over for tea at three.”

Harry sighed. He’d known that at some point he would be entertaining Draco as a guest. He was worried about how the man would feel about his father shacking up with his former adversary. He was also worried that the two Malfoys together would prove more than he could handle.

Harry wasn’t entirely sure why, but he didn’t tell Lucius his son would be over for tea.

Still, when the doorbell rang at three, he called him down into the living room.

“Harry,” Draco said immediately"
". He considered it most seriously until he was down to his skin. ""I do enjoy doing as you tell me. Sometimes.""

""Then you should close your eyes, Draco."" Severus stepped in closer, finally undressing. Finally, because Draco was always nervous if Severus stayed fully clothed. It might mean unpleasant things, although he supposed that unpleasant things could happen just as well with him naked.

Carefully, he curled himself onto the bed, casting a smile before he shifted pillows, settling himself comfortably before closing his eyes and leaning back to wait as patiently as he could manage.

It didn't take long. He heard the tray move, felt Severus settle at his side, seated beside Draco. ""Sometimes, I tire of sitting across from you at the table at dinner.""

""Well, now you are sitting across from me in bed. I expect this is a great deal more enjoyable. At least I think so."" Yes, and then some.

He felt fingers, no, a thumb, linger across his cheek. ""It is. Even if you're insisting on being a brat about it.""

Turning his head to the side, he caught it, sucked it into his mouth. There was salt there, and sweet, and he had no idea what else.  Delicious, and he hummed, finally pulling away again. ""You love me best when I am."" There was no doubt in his mind about that.

He felt Severus shift in a little closer, even as he pulled his thumb away. ""I can't agree with that, or you'll use it against me worse than you already do,"" Severus noted lightly. ""Take a sip of this.""

The cool rim of a glass pressed against his lower lip and he opened his mouth carefully. The warm slide of something crossed his tongue, apple and spice and something with a surprising little shock of a bite. It made him hum and want to open his eyes, but he managed somehow to keep them closed. He swallowed and then sighed. ""Nice.""

The glass was lifted back, and he could hear Severus taking a small sip of the same. ""It's a tea, steeped in cider. I'm becoming rather fond of it.""

Of course he was. Severus loved things with a taste to them, something that had a presence. Just thinking about it made him smile. ""I'm rather fond of you."" And feeling much more patient at the moment, besides.

The taste lingered at the sides of his mouth, the edges of his jaw, tart and tang and spice still filtering through his senses. ""Ha ha, flattery won't get you any more or any less food.""

He couldn't help laughing. ""You still won't let me starve.""

""Never."" He felt faint movement on the bed, and then the announcement, ""Appetizer first. Let me know when you need more to drink.""

Opening his mouth, Draco waited patiently. He managed not to smile, which was quite difficult. ""You know I have nothing against declaring when I want something.""

""The least of your problems."" He felt a touch to the edge of his mouth, another morsel of food against his lips. It felt round, smelled crisp, and the first taste was sweet coated in a fine film of salt. Apple, and he loved apples, the contrast of salt and fruit on his tongue making him shiver and hum. Good, unexpectedly so, and he chewed slowly, licking his lower lip when he was done.

Simple, stupidly simple after the tea and apple cider that was stupidly simple as well, but so tasty. Just a contrast of flavors, lingering against his tongue long after he'd swallowed. ""What do you think of that?""

One more time, he ran his tongue over his lower lip, then reached up and rubbed a thumb along the edge of his mouth. ""Delicious."" Unsurprising, really. Severus, for all his stern and unbending appearance, was a master of sensual delights. It was the little things, really; things like salted apples and who knew what would come next.

The next sensation against his lip was also firm and round, but he could smell the tang of balsamic, and maybe it was tomatoes. He wasn't sure until he bit down, the burst of cherry tomato on his tongue accompanied by the faint pop of the skin bursting, and oh. Oh, that was very nice indeed, made him want to open his eyes to see what came next. He swallowed before he spoke. ""My curiosity is becoming a bit.. overwhelming.""

""I don't want you to get bored. You might not be able to guess the next one, though."" And it wasn't immediately there. There was a lingering stroke of hand against his stomach, fingertips trailing lightly against skin.

""Should I be guessing?"" He couldn't help shifting. The touch was simple, just like the things he had been fed, but it was perhaps all the more arousing because of it"
"to him. It was quite a bit nicer, though, to have his mouth covered with a motion of his wand, muffling the words. Besides, it wasn't as if Draco had any particular options available to him as protests were not going to work. Severus was going to do what he wanted to do. ""I think you're going to enjoy this,"" Severus reiterated, smiling as he bent Draco's right leg at the knee. The bindings adjusted automatically, holding him in place. Such a pretty sight. ""I've been informed the sensation is quite intense.""

Hmmm, yes. Muffling him was going to work out quite well, because Draco was still making the most delicious noises, partially protest, partially lust. He did seem a bit worried about the ginger in the bowl, but then, Draco had always been very good at potions. Very good at projecting them forward into what they might be, which had taken some skill to teach, but he was surely already imagining the properties of ginger in relation to his sexual organs. He lifted up the wet ginger and smirked as he made sure Draco was looking at it.

The whimper was extraordinarily gratifying, and so he leaned down and gently pressed a kiss to the tip of Draco's nose, just for that sound. ""All mine,"" Severus sighed. He pressed the tip against Draco's ass, slightly slimy and slick, and just slowly pushed it in. The point wasn't through penetration, after all, but the sensation that would build soon.

He held such delight in those soft sounds, the pleading that Draco was clearly inclined to do despite the spell keeping him from doing so. The noises in his throat and his chest were delicious, however, and he hoped they would only get better as the evening continued. The rocking, squirming motion of Draco's hips, slow though it was as yet, certainly implied that was the case.

""Does that feel interesting?"" He waited for the nod yes or the headshake no. Either way, he was going to carry on, but he liked to have a gauge.

No, no, no was the answer from the shake of his head, but Severus had always been able to tell when Draco was lying, and when the lie was told out of dread for whatever might come next if he told the truth. That had been extremely irritating when he was a child. As a very attractive young man in his bed with interesting sexual practices, it was something of a delight.

It was the no no no that actually meant yes, because real nos from Draco held a note of something else to them, something too familiar to Severus ever to press at actual nos. A look in his eyes, terror at the concept. This was a much nicer shake of his head that encouraged Severus to pick up the slimmer piece of ginger.

Draco's eyes widened so prettily at that, though it was clear that he had no real understanding as yet of what Severus planned. The rocking of his hips did seem to be increasing, and with it also the strength of his erection. His beautiful hard erection that Severus gave a few strokes with one damp hand, smearing water and ginger oil on the outside of Draco's dick. Severus took his time, and then brandished the bulbous ended ginger sliver. Draco was already shaking his head violently, and there was a certain sheen to that lovely gaze that was certainly inspiring.

With a flick of his wand, he tightened the bonds, keeping Draco still. It didn't keep him quiet -- moans, whimpers, no words -- but it did give him the opportunity to carefully, gently begin sliding the ginger into the small opening at the tip of his cock.

Draco shuddered violently and shook his head again, eyes shutting tightly. The pleading made Severus want to kiss him desperately. Instead, he seated the ginger and reached down to cup Draco's testicles in his hand, roll them gently back and forth.

""If I ungag you,"" Severus offered, letting it trail off because he wanted to hear that sweet whingy begging, the discomfort in Draco's voice.

That seemed to get him the response he wanted, a nodding of Draco's head. His entire body shimmied for a moment, struggling violently against Severus's magic before he stilled, dropped his head back and gave a sob.

After that little show, how could he not ungag him? Severus twitched his free hand, and pulled the gagging spell off while he gave Draco another stroke. ""What was that?""

The shaking increased, and Draco drew in a hard breath through his nose before opened his mouth, letting out another sob. ""Burns. Burns, Severus, it, please. Please, I'm sorry....""

""There's nothing to be sorry for. You're beautiful like this."" He stretched his fingers out, smiling at him as he gave Draco's dick another stroke. It was still just as hard as it had been to start, implying that it wasn't so very painful."
"I know every word in the books which line the walls in my room. Everyone else in this place wonders why I wear my torn up trousers for the fifth year in a row – my ankles are showing, too – and instead of asking for new ones, I ask for a book every time the matron manages to spare some money for us orphans. It’s because they’re stupid and don’t understand the true value of the printed word. No matter, they will come to regret those choices one day. They seem to think that the orphanage will always be there to provide what little there is for them. I know what the world out there is like. Homeless men die on the streets every night. Homeless women whore themselves out to anybody willing. That’s just how it is, but I have no intention of following this cursed pattern. I might have nothing to truly call my own – except for my body and mind, but that is enough.


It will be enough for me to show them all my superiority. I will climb this rotting, broken ladder of society and find a better place for myself. 


I have a sharp mind, an agile body and good looks – that is plenty of proof. I belong above this pile of maggots who eat each other for a few scraps of material. It’s all here; in my head.

Long hallways and many, many doors hold my knowledge. There is still plenty of space; I know my mind has no limits. There are colourful books here and a warm fire which comforts me whenever I’m exhausted after using my powers to keep those fools in line. There is also a small picture frame on the impressive mantelpiece in which I can see a moving, ever changing image as crisp and bring as the real world. It shows a boy around my own age, with bright green eyes full of sorrow and a mop of unruly black hair. His forehead bears the strangest scar I have ever seen, in the shape of a lightning bolt. It strangely warms me to see it etched onto his pale skin so clearly.

He’s thinner than even me and his clothes are almost as bad. He’s made to do chores after his family has gone to sleep and isn’t given food for weeks at a time.

His world looks so much different than mine. There are many strange machines which I have not seen before there and sometimes I wonder if what I can see the future. I don’t let it bother me though. I will find my answer sooner or later, as I always do.

For now, I will settle for watching the green-eyed boy as he curls up to sleep on the broken bed in the cupboard under the stairs. He’s so peaceful when he dreams – a small smile appears on his lips as he whispers something I cannot hear. Wishfully, I imagine his lips forming my name silently.

Maybe I could meet him one day and make him say it and claim him as mine.

Such an imbecilic thought. With that, I leave the luxurious chambers of my mind and settle back into bed, with a fantasy book about time travel and magic tightly gripped in my hand.


Later that night, I dream of him again. 
"
"more depressing, however, is the proclamation that wakes him. 

It’s Christmas.

Oh, Remus thinks glumly, bother.

 

It isn’t that Remus hates Christmas.  He doesn’t have a fervent dislike of everything to do with it, he doesn’t avoid it (though more out of impossibility than from any other reason), he just…doesn’t like it.  And sort of hates it.

At first, it was the memory of what Christmas used to be like that left him bitter and annoyed by the whole affair.  Back before he’d been foolish to wander out into the garden at night, after Father had explicitly said no, the monsters will eat you.

…Bother.  Don’t think about that.

And then there was Christmas After.  Christmas After was terrible because, for whatever reason, the lunar cycle seemed to dislike him enough that more often than not, he would pass it keening in his bed, almost out of his mind with agony while his mother fretted by his bedside.  Recovery was always hard, but there was something about the weariness in his mother’s eyes and the frustrated distance in his father’s every movement which made Remus curl within his wolf till his physical recovery was complete and he had no choice but to emerge, reluctant and human.

Hogwarts was better and worse at the same time.  Better because he was away from his parents, and worse because of the same.  Better because the Marauders were with him – loyal from the start. 

Worse because of the pile of presents at the foot of all their beds, and the meagre collection he would wake to find awaiting him.

 

The best thing about this Christmas is that Sirius can – and does – bound over and shift into dog form in time to pounce on top of Remus and lick his face; not slobbery for once, but light and ticklish instead.

(Still just a little disgusting, of course.)

It’s been a few months but there is still something a little strange in not having to worry about James and Peter-

“Padfoot, you berk, if you’re going to snog the poor thing then at least don’t give him rabies!”

It’s the opposite, in fact – Sirius only gets a few good licks in before James is hauling him off of Remus by the scruff of his neck.  Halfway to the ground, Sirius shifts back in time to grab James by the shoulders.

The bed sinks slightly – it’s Peter, watching the two taller boys wrestle, slightly wide-eyed.

“I don’t believe rabies transmits quite like that,” Remus informs his friend mildly, though whether James is actually listening is quite up in the clouds.  “And even if it did, I’m sure that being a werewolf must-“

“Moony, stop talking and help me out!” Sirius yelps, far too dog-like, as James head-butts him in the stomach. 

Peter shifts his weight slightly.  He smells like chocolate and sweat, even this early in the morning.  “Hey, Remus…You don’t suppose I could just start unwrapping my presents?”

 

The moon isn’t due for another five days, so the muscle pains haven’t started yet. 

The moods have, though; the moods that leave him spiralling further and further down the black hole of self-pity that he feels when he takes stock of the presents at the foot of his bed. 

Five presents; one from James, one from Peter.  One from Frank, wrapped in bright blue paper.  Lily’s is neatly tied with an elegant ribbon arrangement that must be hers, because none of the boys could ever hope to do that.  And one from his parents, in the same brown wrapping they always use.

Nothing compared to the veritable mountain that James is sorting through with far too much enthusiasm (though Remus notes with a certain vindictive satisfaction that none have Lily’s distinctive touch). 

And…nothing from Sirius.

Abruptly, Remus stands.  Only Peter seems to notice, making a slightly muffled questioning noise around a mouthful of chocolate. 

“Breakfast,” Remus says shortly.

It’s almost full moon; not his fault that the door slams shut.

 

There are enough people staying this year that the House tables are still stretched across the room.  Remus is sitting alone at the Gryffindor table, staring at a sausage with little enthusiasm, when a book lands on his head.

If he’d been human, it most probably would have given him a concussion.  As it is, he merely scowls at a poor Ravenclaw girl, sitting a table away from him.  She pales.  He almost feels guilty.

Religion and Magic in South-East Asia: An Introduction, it reads.

Inside the front cover, someone has written a series of painstakingly perfect Runes.

They read: Thine ass is most pleasant, oh resplendent goddess of the moon.

 

 

Four gifts (a book, a beautiful everlasting silver collar and two boxes of chocolate), two injuries and one fall-down-a-flight-of-stairs later, Remus still isn’t sure whether he"
"did, but his nine to five at Gringotts left him completely bagged by the end of the day. Staring at the telly didn’t help, and neither did reading. Both just left his eyes fuzzy and usually ended with him slumped on the sofa when Harry returned late at night.

He’d begged Harry to quit, telling him he’d done enough in the fight against Voldemort, but Harry wouldn’t hear of it. Draco suspected he still had some of that hero complex left over from his Hogwarts days, or maybe it was just that Gryffindor need to help anyone who asked nicely. Harry didn’t need the money, and his daily Auror work left him tired enough. Draco just didn’t think helping new Auror recruits with field work was really necessary. Not to mention what it was doing to their sex life.

By the time Harry got home each night, Draco was sound asleep and there was no hope of rousing an exhausted Harry at seven in the morning for a quick shag before work. Draco didn’t even like to think about how lonely it was when Harry was gone in the field for days at a time.

Draco stared at the half-empty take-away containers on the coffee table and yawned as he checked the clock. Half past ten. He only had another hour or so to go. He’d promised this time; even went as far as leaving Harry a note that morning.


“I promise to wait up for you.”


It’d seemed like a great idea that morning: a bottle of wine, some Muggle classical music, a roaring fire in the grate. Everything a couple needed for a romantic Friday night. They’d had so little time together lately, Draco had almost forgotten what it was like to make love into the wee hours and fall asleep in a contented haze.

Quarter to eleven. Draco raked his fingers through his hair and down over his eyes, rubbing them awake. Maybe a cup of strong coffee would help.

The kitchen was quiet but for the low hum of the refrigerator. Draco poured himself a cup of the coffee he’d made after dinner, deciding against adding milk or sugar. The coffee had been there several hours and he hoped the thick, black liquid would be enough to keep him awake just a little longer. He’d promised, and this time he wasn’t giving in to his overtired body and stinging eyes.

Making his way back to the sofa, Draco glanced once more at the clock. Eleven. If Harry was on time, Draco thought he might just make it. Only thirty more minutes. He could do that. He settled himself on the sofa, kicked the leftovers to the side of the coffee table making room for his slippered feet, and waited. Maybe if he just closed his eyes for a minute…

The gentle softness of fingers carding through his hair woke Draco with a start. He opened his eyes slowly to see Harry looking down at him with a silly grin on his face. “I knew you wouldn’t make it.”

Draco wasn’t giving in to defeat that easily. “I’ve been awake the whole time, Potter. I just wanted to rest my eyes for a moment.”

Harry just laughed. “I’ve been sitting here watching you sleep for almost fifteen minutes, you prat. You looked so peaceful I didn’t want to wake you. Anyway, it doesn’t matter anymore.”

Draco sat up a little and reached for the coffee he’d poured a few minutes ago. He took a large sip and promptly spat it out. Maybe he had been asleep for a while; the coffee was like ice.

Draco considered Harry’s words. “What doesn’t matter anymore?”

Harry grinned. “I quit. You don’t have to wait up for me anymore. No more late nights. No more trips away. I’ll be home every night for dinner. I might even be home before you.”

Draco looked at Harry with trepidation. “Why? Why did you resign?”

Harry looked at Draco with a gentleness that Draco hadn’t seen in some time. He hated to admit he’d missed it, but the truth was he had. Harry’s voice was soft and quiet when he finally answered. “I missed you.”

Harry seemed to lower his gaze as if missing Draco was a weakness he was embarrassed to admit. Draco had to agree it was pretty soppy, but that didn’t stop his heart from doing flip-flops at the thought. Truth was, Draco missed Harry too. Not just the sex, which was definitely spectacular, but he missed just spending time with the man he’d lived with for six years.

Draco pulled Harry down beside him on the sofa and gently trailed his hand down his lover’s back. “I’m glad you’ll be home more. I miss the blow jobs.”

Harry laughed as he snuggled in beside Draco. “Admit it. You actually like having me around.”

Draco started to protest, but the tone"
"hear you if they were close enough, you will yourself to breath slower, and hope that the castle halls are as deserted as they seem.

The sight of her leaning against the statue near the library is what keeps you leaving the warmth of your bed each night; her long, wild curls framing her face, and her dark eyes that melt you to the very core. Your breath hitches as you take in the sight of her, the beauty that is her, and you approach slowly, taking her outstretched hand.

“The library tonight.” she whispers, sending chills through every nerve ending in your awakening body. You nod slowly, knowing you will follow her anywhere she wants to take you as long as she doesn’t let go.

You never really understood why she comes, and why it’s you she wants. You are proud of your house, but you are a Slytherin, which in her eyes should be a danger sign. But as her Gryffindor bravery would suggest, she is never fearful, only passionate and loving and willing to give you a chance.

She leads you through the looming shelves of books, into the restricted section. Your face must show your uncertainty at the location because she runs her palm lightly across your cheek and whispers softly. “No one will find us here Pansy, I promise.” You relax into her touch and her soothing voice. You trust her; you always have.

Pushing you gently against the towering shelf of books, she removes her hand from your face, and you shiver at the loss of contact. Just as quickly she fills the void with her warm lips, kissing your cheek and slowly making her way to your waiting mouth. Your fingers reach up to tangle in her hair, and she pushes forward, gently parting your lips with her tongue.

A quiet moan escapes you as her hands trail down your back, pulling you into her and deepening the kiss. You can already feel the wetness building, dampening your cotton underpants and causing you to press your hips closer to her warm body. She responds by moving her mouth to your neck, and trailing kisses from just below your ear, down your collarbone, to the opening of your blouse.

The feel of her tongue on your flesh is intoxicating and you breathe deeply, taking in the scent of her hair brushing your skin. Her hands move around to the front to work on the buttons covering your taught nipples. Each tiny button brings her closer to your bare breasts, and the thought of what happens next has your head clouded with want.

You have done this many times before, but every time is as thrilling as the first. You can’t get enough of her hands, her lips, and her audible sighs as she lifts your blouse from your shoulders and lets it slide to the floor behind you.

Before you have time to breathe, her fingers are on your nipples, rubbing them gently between her thumb and forefinger, causing them to stand out and eliciting a moan of pleasure and acceptance from your swollen lips. Her fingers are quickly replaced by her beautiful, full mouth as her hands work down to the waistband of your skirt, sending shivers of excitement straight through to your core.

Within moments, but what feels like a lifetime, your skirt is pooled at your feet, and your knickers are circling your ankles. Her eyes move appreciatively over your naked form and you can see the heat in her flushed cheeks. She is as aroused as you are, and the idea makes you even more so.

Deciding your nipples still need her rapt attention, her mouth continues where it left off, her tongue mapping small circles around the hardened flesh. You gasp as her fingers trail slowly down to the patch of soft, wet curls where your thighs meet, and she slides her long finger slowly over your swollen clit. Your hips roll involuntarily, needing her touch, and never wanting it to ever stop.

“Hermione, please…” you hear yourself whimper, your legs threatening to give out underneath you and send you both sprawling on the floor. “Inside me, please.”

She moans at your words and pushes against you, positioning her still-clothed body against your thigh, pushing into you with her hips and then with her finger, sliding deep inside your wetness with a single thrust.

Her body stills for a moment, feeling the heat of your walls tight around her finger, then, unable to control her excitement, she begins to move, rubbing herself against your thigh. She slides her finger in and out of you, the heel of her palm brushing against your clit with each stroke.

You know you’re almost there. You can feel the intensity building deep inside you, your breathing ragged, and your hips moving in pace with her hand. You close your eyes and just feel, feel the fire explode, igniting every nerve ending in your body, covering her fingers with your sweet release.

She pushes against you one more time, watching you come, causing her to moan out her pleasure from the friction, as she too reaches the pinnacle of her orgasm and shudders into your shaky arms.

Somehow you both"
".

""Why am I not dead yet?"" he asks, closing his eyes, keeping my safe from their accusing glare for a few short seconds. He looks so broken, yet ready for a fight to the death.

No, not ready, not ready by any stretch of the imagination, with his pale complexion and his bony cheeks. He could hardly stand on his feet if he had to, but he'd fight. I know he would. He'd fight until his last breath, and he's ready to die fighting. Expecting it even.

""We're all trying very hard to keep you alive, Potter.""

Confusion flashes through his eyes and I can see his mind rattling for answers, trying to figure it all out.

""Why?""

""We're not done with you, we're not giving up on your mind yet.""

""You won't get in, Snape taught me. There's no way you or that son of a bitch Voldemort are going to break through my barriers!""

That same fury as earlier brightens his green eyes to an almost fluorescent shade of acid green. I wonder if it's his magic, being bound like his body, but trying to get out.

I can't blame him. I'd be mad with anger if I were going through what he's going through.

""Where's the bastard anyway? Hmmm? Thought he'd drop by to try some of his usual taunts.""

I take another deep breath and hold it in as long as I can, past the point where my lungs become uncomfortable with the lack of oxygen. The pressure in my nose almost makes me sneeze and I breathe out.

""I've got to go, Potter, hang in there.""

With a few short strides I walk out the door and listen as the Wards on his room flick back into place.

""Mr Malfoy, a moment please?""

Healer Greenberg gestures me into the observation room and I watch through the shimmering wall as Harry retreats back into himself. After a moment the door opens and an orderly walks in with a Healer. They remove the Magical straightjacket and check his vitals before leaving the room.

Harry gets up and moves to the Window, pressing his somewhat dirty fingers against the shiny sill, smudging it, before wiping it clean with the sleeve of his plain white shirt.

I can't hear him from here, but I know what he's muttering. 'Dirty, dirty, dirty.' It's his mantra when he doesn't know I'm in the room.

""Mr Malfoy, I watched your visit from here, and I couldn't help but overhear,"" Healer Greenberg starts, but I interrupt him.

""You mean to say you eavesdropped.""

""Yes, well, I noticed you telling him you've not given up on his mind yet.""

""Stranger things have happened."" I look away from the man and watch Harry rocking back and forth.

""Mr Malfoy, Harry is extremely schizophrenic, has no conception of reality and seems to be stuck in a constant loop of traumatic events. He's unreachable. We've tried everything, but his Occlumency is too strong, and due to his paranoia, we cannot get him to trust us enough to let down his barriers.""

""Yeah, well, he thinks you're all Death Eaters, doesn't he? Of course he won't trust you.""

""We are aware, Mr Malfoy. However, knowing doesn't change the fact that we have no way to treat him.""

I sit down on a wooden chair, leaning my forehead against the shimmering wall.

""He almost seems normal when I'm in the room with him. He's starting to trust me, you know? He's trusted me before."" I swallow thickly, knowing that my words are nothing but make belief and hopeful imagination.

""I'm not telling you to give up on him, however I am telling you to prepare for the possibility he's lost to us forever.""

""Have you even figured out why he is the way he is in the past few months?"" I ask, because I've hardly spoken to the Healers since we brought him in. I leave that up to aunt Andromeda and Molly Weasley. They are the mother hens. I'm just the delusional boyfriend.

Or maybe the delusional boyfriend would be him.

He's been here for six months, and before that he was with me at Grimmauld place for a year, where we all hoped he'd just snap out of it eventually.

""There's no way to tell. It might be something You-Know-Who did during their battle, or maybe it's a pre-existing condition that was aggravated through trauma. There's also the possibility that it's just trauma itself.""

Healer Greenberg sits down calmly on another chair and folds his hands in his lap. I can feel his eyes on me.

I don't get it. I hate the bloody war"
"still wearing a cool smile. He turned it on the adder in his hand.

“ That’s quite enough, Blackscale.”

XXX 

“You- you speak parseltongue, Professor?”

“I do. Something I picked up in my travels. It has its uses, as I’m sure you can attest.”

Quirrel passed Blackscale back to her. Harry took him with numb hands, returning him to around her neck. Blackscale no longer hung limply; he was coiled now, attentive to the wizard in the room.

“Now, Harry, how would you like to summon snakes as well? It normally picks the closest living serpent, but with a bit of practice, you’ll be able to leave your familiar alone.”

It was a tempting proposal. But it wasn’t really a choice was it?

Not because this was detention, but because Quirrel’s smile was plastic and fake, and she couldn’t forget the way his magic had enveloped her before.

Harry nodded slowly. “Alright, sir.”

XXX 

“Hold your wand a bit higher. The motion is- close. Right there. An S-shape. Childish, I know, but it was designed to be idiot-proof. Do that five times or so. Until you’ve got the feel for it.”

Quirrel circled her. He was walking and talking once again, but it was all around her this time. Every time he moved, passing out of her sight, Harry tightened up. It was involuntary. Tensing for a blow that had yet to come.

“Long curve at the top of the S. Better. Start over. Now, focus. The intent is the important part. The wand motion is just window dressing.”

Harry looked up, eyes wide, her terror momentarily broken. “I’d been wondering that.”

“Most wizards are simply too incompetent for anything more than the very basics.” Quirrel’s eyes glittered, catching the torchlight as he turned to speak to her. “All that truly matters is intent and power. That is why magic is the purest strength there is.”

A pause.

“Cast now. Show me your strength.”

When she moved, it was not for him. Quirrel was right- magic was strength, but her magic was hers. Not his. Not the Dursleys. Not all the people who adored her for something her wasn’t.

Letting him have that would be handing over the one thing that was truly hers in this world.


No.


Harry drew the sign in the air, using her wand like a conductor’s baton. Her magic welled up within, surging like white fire, hot enough she thought her breath would ripple in the air, and vast enough there was a sudden flash of fear- a mortal body couldn’t hold this in.

She needed a snake. A snake that wasn’t Blackscale. The snake needed to be here. Right here. Right now. Right now. She needed. She WANTED. 


 “Serpensortia!”


XXX

A tiny, green grass snake wound between her fingers, tongue flicking out to kiss her fingertips.

Quirrel held out his hand for it. Harry hesitated for a moment before letting the serpent slide from her palm to his.

“Most children wouldn’t be able to cast that so quickly.”

“Is she going to be okay?” Harry asked, indicating the grass snake.

Quirrel raised an eyebrow. “I will return her to where she came from. The spell for that is, oddly enough, more advanced.”

“Oh.”

He snapped his fingers and with a pop, the grass snake vanished. “Would you like to learn it?”

She went still.

This had been detention. She’d had to be here. But any more would be on her own.

With him.

Quirrel was still an unknown quantity. He went out of his way to teach her an incredible spell, but also did things with his magic, and the way his personality had shifted was downright eerie.

She knew nothing about him, and he seemed to know everything about her.

He was a parselmouth too- and wasn’t that supposed to be really rare? And genetic, not learned? Padma had said that. She needed to talk to Blackscale about this.

“Why? Why- all of this?” she said, surprising herself with her sudden directness.

For the first time, something genuine crept into his smile. “I enjoy teaching. And you seem to be a more apt pupil than most of your peers.” Quirrel turned and began walking to his desk. “If you have misgivings, feel free to think on them. If you would like to return… I have office hours every day from three to six.”

He shuffled through a few of the pages before looking up at her. “You may leave at any time.”

“Oh. Ah- goodnight, Professor.”

Harry grabbed her bag, pocketed her wand, and made for the door.

“Miss Riddle.”

His voice stopped her with her hand on the knob.

“You wear the name well.”

Time rolled onward."
"him drained.

When Draco started doing what he’s doing, he thought the procedures would be the hard part; and they were, because for a long time he didn’t know if they were possible (but he dug through piles of books and it was, it is, and he has to do something to fight the nightmares, even if they’re never going to let him go)..  But it’s what comes before, the three pre-consultations that the Ministry insisted upon – that Draco himself insists upon – as a condition of him opening up business.

Nott was right; he doesn’t need the money.  If he did need it, there were most probably a myriad of different, easier (less painful) ways of getting it.

Maybe this is penance, he remembers thinking to himself after the seventh enraged attempt to kill him left Draco with strangulation marks around his neck (and he could have healed them but he didn’t).

But-

Suddenly, the wards sing out, humming through his veins; not in warning, and so after the initial shock Draco lets himself relax into the couch, feeling the fire soak into his skin.

“Winky!” he shouts out, request (no more commands, to no one, ever) implicit as he tries to figure out just who would be here at this time.


No more patients, not as far as I know – Blaise came by last month so he won’t be around  for three more – and…


He clamps down on that last because Draco hasn’t seen his father in two years and nothing’s changed

(and isn’t that always the problem?)

Hush, he tells himself, pushing himself to his feet as Winky opens the door to his private living room.

“Mr Malfoy, sir, it is Miss Hermione Granger who wishes to see you, sir,”

He falls back onto the couch.

 

~~~~~

 

In retrospect, he shouldn’t be so surprised.

But he is, because he can’t understand how they’ve gotten from a slap in third year to this, five years after the old world ended and the new began, as gut-wrenchingly tedious and brutal as before.

(Where this means sitting across the small dining table that Draco has in one of the many rooms in his wing of the Manor, tentatively and awkwardly mouthing at food that Hermione Granger has cooked for him.)

(He doesn’t know whether to be more surprised at the fact that he’s eating Granger’s cooking, or the fact that it’s good, some sort of rolled-up lasagne that he’s too afraid to ask the name of.)

She makes a small sound, a cough or something that seems more an attempt to dispel the thick, repressive silence than a genuine need to clear her throat, and Draco barely restrains himself from flinching.

“This is good,” he tries feebly.

Granger smiles, slight but sincere.

“You don’t have to lie,” she says softly.  He didn’t realise it back in the street the night before, but now he does; her voice has changed, lost its arrogance (confidence) and fervour, become quiet in a sense that doesn’t change with volume.  “I’m not a particularly good cook,” she continues, and her lips quirk before the smile falls away altogether.  “Ron used to…”

Shifting in his seat uncomfortably, Draco racks his mind for something to say to that – but before he manages to come up with anything, she shakes her head.

“Thank you for last night.”

He shrugs, taking advantage of the mouthful of food in his mouth to give him time to think up a response.  “No problem,” he settles for.  “I was in the area.”

Draco winces almost as soon as he says that – over-casual at best, crass at worse – but she laughs slightly.  “You’re not going to ask why?”

Why what is painfully obvious; not just why she was being attacked, but why she couldn’t Disapparate, why someone had tattooed binding symbols onto her collarbone with raw magic.

For lack of anything better to do, he shrugs again.  “It doesn’t matter, Granger.  Eight on one isn’t fair, and they didn’t look like Aurors.”

(Not that that means anything anymore.)

“Thank you, Malfoy.”  It’s the first time she’s used his name since the last time they met, a year ago.  “And it’s Hermione,” she adds, almost as an after-thought.

Draco looks up to meet Grange- Hermione’s eyes across the table, warm and hazel.  He doesn’t realise he’s staring till he finds himself comparing her eyelashes to those of her dreamself – with a start, he looks away.

“No problem,” he mutters again, taking another bite of the food.  It doesn’t feel like it’s enough, so “and Draco, please.”

The silence stretches, but it’s not quite as uncomfortable as before"
"heavy weight of it; to palm the cane where he sat and watched, gaze heavy and aroused because god. Yes.

Just... yes. 

Every button came apart slowly, and then Severus just let it slip to the floor, the heavy fabric hitting the stone almost noisily. Merlin, but he did love that stiff material, loved to rub against it when he was entirely naked and Severus was completely clothed. Later. That could come later. For now, he stood and tipped his head to the side, considering Severus with serious mien. ""Against the table.""

He hesitated, stared slowly before he turned and bent over the table.

Severus was lean and pale and scarred, and Draco walked closer, leaned out and laid his hand against Severus's spine, stroked his way down to the curve at the small of his back. ""I love to see you like this.""

He didn't give himself the opportunity to give in completely, and Draco had to repeat the motion to get a response, a shiver as his fingers slipped around old scar tissues.

""Not everyone would see what I do."" They never had. ""That is to my advantage. I see what they don't, and that means that I can have you. That I can give you what you want.... or perhaps what you need.""

His shoulders bowed slightly, but he continued to brace himself against the table, waiting and quiet except for a hum of agreement. Leaning in, he pressed his lips to the nape of Severus's neck, then another against his right shoulder blade, then another against his spine.

""Are you prepared?""

""I am."" He stretched his legs carefully, and rocked his hips back slowly, offering.

Waiting.

Stepping back, Draco raised the cane and struck through the air, letting the sound of it whistle viciously. He could see the flinch of Severus's shoulders and he hummed to himself, and raised it again.

Raised it and waited, watched Severus tense in perpetration for a blow that would only come when he wanted it to, because he could control himself. He could control all of it, and Draco smiled, let his mouth curve in pleasure, and he waited until Severus relaxed before he brought it down with a wide motion of his arm.

Severus hissed, squirming hard, a twist of his shoulder and hips as if he could get away. He could have, but he stayed leaned against the table.

""Aren't you going to count?"" It was a bit sarcastic, and he would pay for that eventually. Draco didn't particularly care.

""I, uhm, two..."" Belated but wonderful to hear the strain in his voice, hesitation in it.

""Two,"" Draco agreed in a purr of sound, leaning in and tracing a thumb down the line of the first one. It paralleled nicely to the second, and the hiss of breath Severus gave made him moan. God, that was delicious.

Sometimes he strapped him, and it was lovely, and warming somewhere deep in his chest. Severus always returned the... well, perhaps favor was an inappropriate term for the matter.

Highly inappropriate, in fact, and he knew that this was going to earn him an uncomfortable evening of his own eventually. Even knowing that, he stepped further back and raised the cane, head tipping to the side before the next judicious strike.

Severus waited for the blow, lips parted to say 'three', waiting and wound up in the tension. He let it settle in his chest slowly, spread to his arm, and then he swung. The immediate blossom of red across skin, the sound it earned him, made Draco breathe in sharply and bite his lip.

""T-three."" There was a groan and a biting noise, and Severus's head hung down sharply. He panted, and he was shaking, arms trembling, and Draco was hard as nails, didn't know if he would manage to keep from coming in his trousers as a response.

""Three. Would you like another?"" Mocking, perhaps. Maybe a bit too much.

He could imagine Severus at ten, at twenty, his back flayed from the blows, muscles tenderized and the bruising deep. He could take five, leave Severus with five solid, good blows. The man inhaled sharply, and started to shake his head before he stopped. ""Please...""

Five was a good solid number, and Draco drew back his arm and laid on the next. It earned him a cry that broke in the center, and Severus nearly buckled then. Almost.

He held himself up, barely, arms shaking, breath heaving raggedly as he tried to brace himself long enough to utter four. Draco could hear wild emotion in Severus's voice, threading through the background.

Merlin. He was hard as a rock, and he bit his lip, watching, planning, eyeing the welts across Severus's skin. One more. Just the one, and he knew that this was far beyond what he could bear. Incredibly far, and yet Severus wanted it, Severus"
"bed. He was sure of it, that this was his punishment for some past indiscretion, that he was going to be fucked and fondled and stroked to death, that he'd shake himself to pieces.

""Please. Please, sir, please, Severus, please. Please, no more."" No more, and it wasn't that he was in pain. It would be ridiculous if he were because he slept with a fucking potions genius, a man so brilliant that he had managed to fake his death and hide from the entire magical world for years before Draco had stumbled across him at a bazaar in South America.

Right at the moment, he honestly wished that he hadn't. Hadn't, because it had been hours. Hours, and he had come three times, three. His balls were empty and twitching and hurt, and his ass was fucked open and wide, and he just ached everywhere. Ached and wanted it to stop, but he also hated for it to end, just a little.

He wandered back into the room with a glass of wine in hand and a relaxed expression that made Draco want to howl. ""Yes?""

""Would you just. Would you just please, please."" He didn't even know how to beg properly anymore; he was scattered and shaking, trembling, and he had no idea what time it was or if it was even the same day. It didn't feel like the same week. ""Please, I need this to be done."" He didn't want to come again, he didn't, but he was still so hard. Hard and hot and sweaty and Draco thought he might well kill someone if they stood between him and the bath once this was finally done. ""Please, I can't. I can't.""

Then again, as worn thin as he felt, he might not have the energy to bathe.

""You can't.... take anymore? Come again?"" Severus was smirking slowly as he sidled into the room. ""Specifics, Draco.""

""I hate you!"" Seething, yes, and that was stupid. ""I hate you, Severus, I hate you, I can't. Please, please stop. Please, n... uh!"" Uh, because that was touch, that was hands sliding over him, so many, and he couldn't help sobbing.

Severus was smirking and drinking, smiling as he sidled in closer and added his fingers to the touch against Draco's flank. ""Beg. Make me know how ready you are.""

Fucking Merlin. How, how could he, how, there was no way that he could, he couldn't do more than he already had, and he was fairly certain that he babbled out something nearly hysterical. It was a combination of whimpers and sobs and, ""Please, please, please, please. I can't, I can't, I need, I need this to be over, I can't anymore, I can't!""

""You can't what?"" Fuck, fucking tease, he was going to rip Severus to pieces if he didn't break the spell soon, because everything ached and hurt and he was sheathed in sweat and cold and over-warm.

""I can't anymore. I can't, it's too much, I can't."" It was a gibber, he knew it, and the sweat mingled with tears, and he couldn't stop shaking. ""I can't take anymore, please!""

He felt the ghostly brush of lips against his skin, and then it all stopped with the weight of a train crashing. Just stopped, and the sensation on his skin, his dick, his ass, fell away. The sudden loss of sensation was orgasmic, utter bliss, and Draco couldn't help crying out because fuck. Fuck, he was coming again, and he laid there, gasping desperately for breath, exhausted and trembling and drenched in bodily fluids.

Severus pressed loose fingers against his back, tracing his spine before offering the wine glass to him in a slow motion. ""Drink.""

More like guzzle, a desperate need to slake his thirst, and he whined in between every swallow, trembling. It tasted dry, bitter and sharp, too strong a red to be chugged like that, and somewhere in there it began to turn to water.

By the time he couldn't drink anymore, the most he could do was go limp and tremble. Honestly, Draco was fairly certain that it would be a miracle if he moved for days. ""Hate you."" Except he didn't, and from the utterly pleased expression he could see through bleary exhausted eyes it was apparent that Severus knew that.

""If you were less stubborn, I'd have to put in less effort to hear those noises from you,"" he countered, a drawl, a bare sound of amusement as he stroked Draco's flank.

""Despise you,"" he moaned, and shivered, oversensitive and still catching"
"clearly had some straps in fascinating places. It didn't look like anything that would get him fucked, but then again, magic could be strange. ""All right, so....""

""So, sit in it. It should be comfortable,"" Severus smiled, giving a waving twitch of his wand.

It made him extraordinarily distrustful. ""I find myself slightly suspicious...."" If slightly actually meant a great deal.

""I find you're going to enjoy this when you sit down."" Severus gestured at him, gave him another zap of sensation right at his elbow. Draco squeaked and jumped, shooting him a sullen glare and then settling onto the stool... carefully.

Very carefully.

There was nothing at first. Nothing except a chair that quickly snapped locks over his legs, his arms. ""I don't even have to touch you. It's gorgeous.""

Draco's breath caught, and he automatically started pulling at his arms and legs to see if he could get loose. ""Severus!"" He was pretty sure that was a protest, but then again... It was sort of hot.

""Oh, this is out of my hands. Except for a slight modification or two, of course -- it was originally designed for a woman."" Severus pulled a chair up, and sat down in it, leaning forward slightly.

""A woman?"" He squeaked and looked down when his knees pulled apart, one to either side, and he squirmed fitfully. ""Severus, women bloody...!"" Lubricated naturally and also, the hole wasn't in the same place, and he was actually worried about this, even if it was hot.

He squirmed, and couldn't move, couldn't lift his hips. It was like a full body immobilizing spell, except he could still move. There was just no getting anywhere with it. ""Yes, yes, I took care of that. See?""

See, because there was something slick probing at his ass, teasing at him, and Draco gasped, mouth opening wide. ""Oh!"" Oh, shit. Shit, because that was accompanied by the feel of hands stroking up over his immobilized knees and up his thighs, one curling around his cock as the other stroked up his side.

Severus hadn't had to cast a single spell, hadn't lifted a finger to inflict that sensation on Draco. He was watching, though, while invisible hands stroked the length of Draco's arms, idled over his fingertips in a gentle caress that slowly made its way back down to his hips. He couldn't help biting his lower lp and then letting go, licking them and drawing in a deep breath. Oh, stars. Merlin, that was so nice, so good to feel, and he rocked slowly before realizing that the movement made the teasing between his cheeks... shift.

Shift away, and then back, teasing at him while he tried to move again, while he tried to get more of the sensation. There was a touch, like a lick against his ass, and he looked at Severus, shuddering, mouth open. He didn't know what to say or what to do, and he needed some kind of cue. The hands were still touching him, sliding up his back now, finding spots that he didn't even know he had.

Severus smirked and arched an eyebrow at him. ""Oh, don't look at me. It's responding to what you need.""

""What I...?"" Oh. Oh fuck. Oh fuck, because the fingers were sliding further down his back, teasing him, opening him up, and whatever it was that rose from below seemed to have its mind clearly set upon getting inside of him. Draco moaned fitfully, pulling at the restraints and trying to get a hand free, because it was big. It was so big, and he didn't think he could take it, couldn't help making soft, pleading sounds and squeezing his eyes tightly shut. ""Please, Severus!""

""You're gorgeous like that. Beautiful."" Severus scooted his chair further, clearly to get a better look. He exhaled shakily. ""I wish you could see it. It should fit.""

Oh god. Oh, god, it should? He jerked, and it surged upwards, into him, splaying him wide, legs almost paralyzed with the sensation. It seemed to take all of the breath out of him, and then he managed to gasp sharply and yell. Sweet Dallben, the burn and stretch was intense, so sharp that it brought heat to his face and tears to his eyes and he struggled momentarily, trying to get free. Perhaps he begged, even, but Severus only watched him take it, watched him getting fucked. The hands were back, stroking his flagging erection, pinching his nipples, and Draco sobbed, rocking hard as if that could help. It did, a little, because there was something like withdrawal, but then he was filled again, hard and impossibly thick, and he cried out, dropping his head back.

Then it started to"
"The door was locked.

Severus was unclear on exactly why the door was locked, or what it was that had prompted this particular little snit. He was halfway tempted to force the door down and take Draco over his knees immediately except that he had a vague suspicion. Just a feeling, of course, but sometimes that worked out well for him.

Instead, he leaned against the door. ""Draco. Unlock this door.""

""No!""

He could tell that he was on the other side, leaning against the door. He just wasn't entirely certain why.

There was definitely a spanking in their future.

""Draco Maledictus Malfoy, you will open this door immediately."" That wasn't going to work, either, but it was a step that needed to be taken.

""Shan't!""

Bloody hell. It was like dealing with a two year old only with an infinitesimally larger accumulation of words. Then again, he didn't seem to be busy there, and the vague shadow coming beneath the door implied that he was leaning against it, calm as anything.

Interesting. ""Is there any particular reason why not?"" If he were a sane man, he'd simply leave.

Draco was very quiet for a long moment, and when he answered his voice was almost a purr. ""I want you to ask me to come out. Nicely."" He paused. ""Very nicely.""

He wanted him to beg. How intriguing, and yet how mundane. Still, it wasn't something he ever expected to hear out of Draco. ""Draco, please come out.""

""That's not nice enough."" No, likely not, and he wondered if Draco had some sort of mirror spell so he could watch him while he was at it. ""Yet.""

He tried not to roll his eyes when he leaned against the door. ""Please, Draco. Please come out of the bathroom in which you have locked yourself because you're more melodramatic than your father.""

""That's not nicely."" No, it wasn't, and Severus drew his wand, considering what to cast. ""Ask me nicely.""

He exhaled, and lowered the wand. ""Draco. Please. Please just open the door.""

In all honesty, he could practically feel the response that got him, door or no door. Draco shifted against it, legs spreading out if the shadow was any sort of indication. ""Ask again."" Yes, there it was. Breathy, just a little excited.

""Please, Draco. Please open the door. There are things I want to do with you that I can't if you're locked in the bathroom."" More of a wheedle, with promises attached now. Never mind that a hairbrush and Draco's ass were the primary objects on the list.

""Ohhh, sir, that..."" Definitely getting off on it, and while it was a terribly mundane sort of kink, it was at least tempting. It would be more appealing if he had some way to watch. ""One more time.""

He leaned in close to the edge of the door, and exhaled. ""Draco, please open the door for me.""

Hitch of breath, just loud enough to hear. ""And when I open the door, sir? What then?""

""I promise I'll make it worth your while. Please, Draco. Just open the door for me."" He waited, listening for the hand that came to the doorknob. Finally.

Soft metallic sound, and then there was Draco looking up at him, face flushed, lips bitten, clearly deeply aroused. ""All right.""

He leaned in, kissed those lightly bitten lips, and lingered there for a moment. ""Thank you."""
"finally dozing off when the sound of the Floo startles me, and when I hear footsteps on the stairs I try to quickly, but carefully, extract my body from underneath my children. I don't want to rouse them, but I'm in no position to protect them like this.

It's only when I hear a soft 'Harry?' in Molly's warm voice, that I fall back and relax.

""In here,"" I softly call out, and only Jamie moves, his eyebrows knitting together in a frown, his little hands briefly clenching.

She appears in the doorway and raises a hand to her heart with a soft smile on her face.

""How's Draco?"" I ask her, and my heart clenches as her smile falls slightly.

""I considered giving him a dreamless-sleep Potion, but ended up doing some meditation exercises with him instead. He's asleep for now.""

""Good."" I close my eyes and run a hand over Lily's soft hair. ""Don't give him any Potions, the Healer said it could set him back.""

Finally managing to shift my children away from me, I sit up and scoop Scorpius up in my arms.

""Here,"" Molly says, holding her arms out to take him. ""I'll take him back to his bed, shall I?""

I nod and I bring Lily back to hers myself, hovering slightly longer than necessary and kissing the top of her head before I go. When I step back into the hallway, Molly is holding a drowsy James.

""Dad?"" he asks.

""G'night, Jamie,"" I say and kiss his cheek before Molly brings him to his own room.

The decision to go to Dray's room is unconscious, but that's where Molly finds me when all three children are fast asleep and tucked in their own beds.

""He's remembering your marriage,"" she says and takes my hand as she sits down next to me on Dray's bed. ""He's having a hard time trying to rhyme his husband with his father figure.

I guess my jaw looks like it's about to drop off my face by the way it's hanging so far beneath its regular pose. I'm gobsmacked. It wasn't the memory of an insane Dark Lord, or a sadistic father, that sent him into a full out panic attack. No, it was me, or rather his memory of me.

Isn't this what I've been trying to avoid the past few years by having him call me Harry? By forcing him to not see me as his father?

""It's understandable, honey. He'll come around when he's able to get everything into perspective. You've found each other against all odds, you'll manage to find each other again.""

I burry my face in her shoulder when she wraps her arms around me. I can't help the tears escaping my eyes, though I try my very best. It hurts. It hurts so much. It's like the tight band that's been around my chest for the past few years is only getting tighter, making it harder and harder to breathe.

Because Draco is my air, I can't be without him. I can't lose him, not now, not after all we've been through trying to get him back.

It's the doubts that hurt the most. I can hear what Molly's saying, that he'll be back when his memories are fully returned, but I can't help but feel that nothing ever really went my way. I've always had to pay a high price for my happiness, and I've been waiting for the hammer to fall ever since Draco and I got married. With having James, Lils and Scorp, Draco's accident just hasn't been enough to tip the balance.

But that's my fear talking, the fear of ending up alone. I can't let that fear strike me down. Gryffindors are brave, they fight their fears and stand strong in the face of defeat. So I do the only thing I can think of and pull back from that comforting hug and dry my tears.

""Yes, we will. I'm not going to give up on us, not ever.""

Molly pats my cheek and smiles encouragingly. ""There's my Harry,"" she says, and pats my cheek some more. Her smile is forced though. She's worried about him. About us.

""Try and get some sleep, honey, you'll need it. I hope you realize what you are in for, giving Blaise and Ginny carte blanche on the party?""

I groan when I remember their wedding. Their grand, two-day-wedding. The one that had all the guests needing a honeymoon to recover from. With Blaise and his Italian traditions, and Ginny as the family's Benjamin, not wanting to be outdone by her elder siblings. They"
"looked a bit confused not sure how to answer the question ""How many of those did someone else give to you?"" Tonks rephrased the question. ""All of them?"" Tonks asked taking a guess. Harry nodded.

""How many happened at Hogwarts?""

""One or two"" Harry replied quietly. ""Please don't tell Sirius about them"" Harry said as he started walking out of the room.

""Oh no you don't, I'll tell Sirius and Remus if you don't tell me how you got them"" Tonks threatened, feeling a bit bad using that as leverage. Harry sighed and figured Tonks had already seen them so he explained his life at the Dursley's.

""Hey is everyone alright here?"" Sirius asked

""Oh sorry I blew open this door and it knocked Harry back and there was a nail sticking out of the boards"" Tonks explained leaving out what she found out about Harry, as he requested.

""Well Remus is going to leave now so..."" Sirius said tailing off.

""Oh yeah we'll say goodbye but do you mind if I stay here, I feel a bit bad about Harry and I wanna make sure he’s gonna be fine""

""Sure why not we've got plenty of room"" Sirius grinned.

⍭⍭⍭⍭⍭later that night⍭⍭⍭⍭⍭

""Tonks what’s wrong?"" Sirius asked.

""I don't know what you mean.""

""Ever since you've chased him you've gotten really defensive about him"" Sirius said crossing his arms.

""Look he told me something and made me swear not to tell you, I only found out by accident, I'm sure he'll tell you later, but right now I think he just wants a happy life with you.”

Tonks had started coming over more often to see Harry. He found it nice because he had someone to talk to about his troubles since she already knew. Tonks was also the first person that knew about the beatings.

""Harry you have a crush on anyone"" Tonks asked. Harry nodded.

""Who is it then"" she asked.

“Its embarrassing"" Harry said his cheeks turning red

""It’s ok you can trust me who is it"" Tonks asked again. Harry shook his head. ""Fine i'll find out eventually"".

Christmas time was near again with everyone leaving to visit their family, and finally Harry did to. Harry had gone to the Weasley's house once and it was quite pleasant of course, but when he saw them celebrating it reminded him that he didn't really have his own family to spend Christmas with, well back then at least.

""Hey Ron I’m gonna go with Sirius for Christmas tell your mum I'll be there on Christmas eve"" Harry told Ron as they walked back to their room.

""You better mate or I won't be here after break due to the lack of skin on me"" Ron said knowing it to be mostly true.

""Hey, you guys are going to study over break right"" a voice from behind them called.

Both Harry and Ron groaned when they heard the voice. ""It's Christmas Hermione I don't want to"" Ron groaned.

Hermione grinned ""You don't think I'm that mean do you.... wait do you?"" she asked worriedly.

Harry laughed ""Well it's almost like you're another teacher that follows us around except more fun to hang with.""

""Just as long as you guys don't think I'm mean"" Hermione replied.

""Only sometimes"" Harry said and Hermione smacked him on the shoulder. ""Hermione why don't you stop by Ron's on Christmas eve i'll be there as well"" Harry said.

""I might just have to I haven't spent a Christmas with you guys yet"" Hermione replied, smiling after she thought about it.

""Well I'll try to be there at least"" Harry decided to mention. 

""Well why is that?"" Ron asked impatiently. He really didn’t want to blamed for Harry not showing up.

""Well I'm not exactly sure how to get there"" Harry admitted. Seeing a look on Hermione's face he knew that she realized the same thing.

""Oh well I bet I can get my parents to pick you guys up, after what happened second year with the car I don't think I'll ever be let near it again"" Ron said sadly, he had liked driving the car and everything, well apart from the part where he crashed into the tree and broke all the windows bent the wheels, and axles... that tree was surprisingly strong. Harry grimaced as he remembered that night also. Hermione looked a bit annoyed because she didn't really know exactly how it happened because she wasn't a bad student, well that's how she thought of it at least.

Hermione noticed a girl with pink hair walking towards them ""Ah Harry"" Tonks smiled.

""Oh hey Tonks"" Harry replied.

""Harry who is this"
"hold on, to fight back. They were hardly in a position to retaliate though.

Hermione wasn’t taking the loss of her boyfriend well, making less and less level-headed judgements about where they should go next. Harry hadn’t even had the time to mourn his best friend, though he felt strangely empty and... incomplete. He was always keeping his mind busy, thinking of ways to get in contact with any remaining Order members.

And yet, he felt a strange itch whenever he picked up his wand. His magic didn’t feel right, his memories of the battle for Hogwarts were a jumbled mess and he didn’t know what to make of it all.

He was so, so tired and confused. Confused was the worst. It made his mind vulnerable to attack. He couldn’t afford to be so careless, so he pushed all the concerns aside forcibly, focusing on finding the next place to hide and consoling a brokenly crying Hermione.

 

Exhaustion was creeping up on him, but he fought it relentlessly. If he gave in… he could kill another one of his friends while sleep walking again.

 

*

 

In his dreams, he wandered cold, empty halls of Voldemort’s manor. It was always so silent.

Nagini would slither up to him sometimes and perch herself on his shoulders, her huge mass feeling somehow right. He wasn’t scared; it was a dream after all.

Then there were the whispers. Shrill and jittering, they seemed to crawl out of the shadows, always finding him. There was no place he could hide from them.

Tonight felt different though. His magic was unsettled and the whispers, louder than usual, seemed to wrap around him, heavy and suffocating.

 


Don’t tell me what to choose for my Horcrux, Tom. 



How much longer do I have to stay at Hogwarts? Those idiots are driving me crazy.



Marvolo, could you…. Yes… Right there!



 


The whispers wormed their way into his ears, no matter how he tried to shut them out. It was his own voice; he didn’t want to hear it! What the hell was this, some new trick of Voldemort’s?

 


Could you teach me how to control the Inferi?



Don’t say that. I might have killed Cedric, but there is no need for you to spit on his grave. 



Here, it’s… for your birthday.


 

The whispers were getting louder, echoing in his mind over and over again, endlessly. He had no choice. He would follow the damned little voices, consequences be damned. They led him through many long hallways, all devoid of life and light. Harry’s feet felt cold and numb, but he kept on going, urged by the whispers hovering around him.

 


I wanted to at least be there when you killed Dumbledore. It wouldn’t have been suspicious, the old man adored me and everyone knows it.



Voldemort… No, I can’t say it. It would be like you calling me Potter. Just - no. Marvolo, the Heir of Slytherin sounds much better. Mar-vo-lo….



 


Nagini slithered up to him, her cold scales rubbing against his bare feet.

“Tonight, young master returns to ussss… Welcome back,” she hissed at him, turning down her head in an odd sort of bow.

He recoiled, his heart beating so fast it could jump right out of his chest. His head hurt. What the hell was all this? It had to be a nightmare, but if he was asleep, why were his feet so sore? Why could he feel the smooth, cool scales of the snake? Where was he, even? It wasn’t a place he had seen before.

 

The whispers were surrounding him now, echoing in his mind so loudly he could not think.

Follow, don’t think, they said. He waits for you each night, you know?

And there, through the final oak door, was Voldemort. His features looking peaceful, he breathed in and out slowly. He was asleep.

Harry almost did a double take. He had never imagined the bastard doing something so… human. He’d always seemed so far above everyone else, it seemed almost as though he did not need to do any of the things all others did. Draped over a large, luxurious chair in front of the fire, he was relaxed and his right hand was unconsciously caressing two rings on his left.

 

It’s yours, said the whispers excitedly, reverberating in the silence of the room. Voldemort did not wake. Take it. Come back.

 

His mind was reeling, trying to grasp onto anything that made sense in this bizarre dream. His body moved on its own though, instinctively knowing what to do.

The golden ring on Voldemort’s finger had a phoenix engraved on it. It had rubies for eyes and suddenly Harry was grasping it in his own hands, transfixed by it.

Everything fell silent. There were no whispers.

Voldemort’s ruby coloured eyes were looking at him, through him, right"
"sighed.

""Isn't there another way to do this like civilized beings? A good old duel to the death?"" A beat later Draco dropped unconscious to the floor. ""Well. That was easy.""

Ziggy halted him with a reluctant noise and said, ""Draco Lucius Malfoy has begun his trial. Now sip.""

Is it really worth touching a rim that has borne the kiss of a Malfoy? Of course, he would have felt the same had it been Narcissa. Some blood is tainted. On the other hand… His mind made up, he said so that all in the vault could hear him, ""Let it not be said that a Potter-Black should refuse to walk where a Malfoy has not so graciously gone before."" And he took a swig, the sour, diffusive, coppery taste strong on the tongue and hard down the gullet.


How do vampires get off on this?


Any further sass that he'd had in mind faltered. The vault wavered. He laid a steadying hand upon the desk, seeing double - the surly master-goblin, and a scene of some far away gloomy English day. ""Uh."" He said intelligibly.

""Awaken, or forfeit. The Grail shall answer if you do not.""

Harry sank to his knees, grip still present upon the desk yet quickly slipping, until he had fallen to his rump with his gaze panning up to the swaying lanterns. He could just make out the conversation growing around him as a part of his mind fell away into long centuries past, while another part of his fading thoughts kept his tongue from lolling out the side of his mouth and stopped his eyes from closing.

And then he lost track of the latter.

With a sound like a muggle train-wreck, Harry snapped back into awareness in the middle of a forgotten English field surrounded by hundreds of medieval soldiers in arms shouting war cries. Full iron plate and steel crashed together, maces, war hammers and shields colliding like an orchestra from hell.

Harry clapped his hands to his ears with a curse that would have made Sirius' proud. ""What in the name of Morgana's everlasting rack is going on?""

Several variations involving the remainder of her lovely figure followed as he rolled aside of a handful of knights locked quite literally at the hip and still pummeling each other brutally. Blood leaked like a sieve through mail and ran in thick rivulets down the outside of battered joints, splashing loose with each ringing thud.

Harry's eyes leapt around the violent battlegrounds for a chance to get to his feet and get away. It took him several more moments of narrowly dodging on his hands and knees and, at last, being partially trampled by a pair of yowling jousters, before he remembered that he was a wizard. He closed his eyes and rolled on the spot, feeling that welcome, crushing clutch of Disapparition squeezing him through a pinprick of reality over the literal crushing sensation of iron boots undauntedly stamping his ribs apart. A moment later he could breath again as he reappeared in a grassy plane only a little removed from the brunt of the clashing.

He sat up with a grimace. This was no time to be ginger about the bruising and worse now spanning generously underneath his shirt, as a quick pat down proved he had nothing poking through where it did not belong and everything still attached where it should have been. A shard of splintered wood the size of a Quaffle spun through the air and gouged out the dirt only inches from his left hand as a reminder that this was no place to be for a comparably speaking, naked wizard.

""What did I get myself into now?"" He patted his jeans down and with triumph found his wand holster still tucked away just where he had left it, following Igh'rhuuk's orders in the lobby of Gringotts. And like another train barreling through his brain, he remembered what had lead up to this unfortunate set of circumstances. ""Oh you son of a Quintaped, Ziggy,"" he bit off as he scrambled away from another piece of shrapnel and snapped the holster into place around his right forearm. The supple leather conformed comfortably into place, ready for the correct amount of tension and intent to eject eleven inches of holly and phoenix feather into his awaiting palm.

Finding his feet as the knights continued to bash each other senseless, Harry circled far around them, then began to sight the surroundings for more information. No sign of two particular commanders in charge, or even much in the way of camps, which he assumed meant that the opposing forces had marched and decided to commence battle at once.

No trace of Draco skewered on the end of a pike, more's the pity.

As he examined the dismal landscape further outward, a glint of silver off of a decent knoll to the... north-west, he approximated, caught his eye. Aha. Two horseback men ensconced in unsullied, glistening armor sat there observing the bloody chaos taking place below. Only the taller of the two wore a crown, which meant a noble of some sort. The banners flapping in the cloudy breeze at their backs gave him a moment's hesitation.

"""
", he pulled away. 

""I'm sorry, George."" 

He'd seen more than enough of this girl in school, starting his fourth year. No matter where he and his brother were, she wasn't far off. Very quiet, always trying to hide behind a group of passing Slytherins, or pretending to ignore them, but it seemed like she was always there. 

""I don't want your pity,"" he grumbled, continuing to ignore her. 

The first time they'd spoken, she'd said the same thing. Bullied by older kids in her own house, she'd been left outside without a coat or her robe. Taking pity on the poor first year had been Fred's idea, surprisingly. Pranks were one thing, he'd said, being mean was quite another. Even if she was in Slytherin. 

They'd snuck out and draped a quilted blanket their mother had made over her shoulders. She'd stood quickly, pulled the blanket close around her shoulders, and glared at them. ""I don't want the pity of two Gryffindor fourth years!"" She had kept the blanket, though. 

""I'm not asking you to take my pity,"" she replied, fiddling with something in her lap. 

""Oh?"" 

""You're not the only person who lost someone that day, George Weasley."" 

George couldn't bring himself to care; Fred had been the only person important who died that day. Aside from Voldemort. And only one of those men's deaths made the world a better place; the other darkened it. 

""You keep asking yourself, 'Why wasn't it me?' don't you?"" Trissie asked, her voice quavering. ""You want to take back the whole battle and hope you can protect him. Keep him from leaving you."" 

George's ear perked up. She was speaking some of his recurring thoughts aloud. 

""I... I feel the same way, George. About Collin. About Fred. About every single person that died in that damn castle."" She lapsed into silent sobs. ""But, there isn't much we can do about it now, is there?"" Tris asked finally, wiping her eyes. ""I'm not saying forget Fred. I'm not saying don't mourn him. But you have to get on with your life."" She took his hand again with both of hers. 

George looked over at the girl; she was no longer the innocent little Slytherin he'd given the blanket to. The scar that marred her face made him wince, and he had to look away. The pretty face of a sheltered sixth year school girl was gone; the tortured face of a woman who'd lived through hell had replaced it. 

""Look at me, George."" 

George refused to look. He had to deny that there were people worse off than him. Nobody could truly be worse off than him; he was only half a person. Nothing could be worse than half a person. 

""It'll get better, George, you'll see."" 

""I doubt that,"" George shot back bitterly, turning to look at the girl again. 

Tris dropped his hand and stood up. ""Fine. Be the pessimist. But let me tell you just how great a life you have. My family disowned me for standing against the Dark Lord. My boyfriend, who was coincidentally my only friend in school, is dead. I'm not old enough to do magic for another month, and I'm homeless. I have no money to buy my school supplies for next year or any way to get a job!"" 

Tris stood there, fire in her eyes as she refused to cry in front of this older man. The man who had been her idol in school. ""I used to look up to you, George. You didn't let anything get you down. Not even Umbridge. But right now, you're being pathetic."" She threw the bundle that she'd been fiddling with at George before storming back into the house. 

He just sat there staring at it, even after Ginny came out and chewed his remaining ear off. ""I mean, really, George? Tris was only trying to make you feel better. You didn't have to be a prick about it!"" 

Ginny eventually went away. George was still staring at the bundle. It was the blanket he and Fred had given Trissie so many years ago. It wasn't the first time they'd passed it back and forth. 

At the end of his fourth year (her first), she'd found the pair stewing over Ginny's disappearance in a corner of the Great Hall. In silent understanding and apology, Tris had draped the blanket over their shoulders and left before any Slytherins would notice her. 

They passed it back to her when they found her crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom the next year. And she'd given it back after she heard that Professor McGonagall had managed to confiscate all of their dung"
"Every night they brought them.  New sacrifices to feed the ravenous ache and dull the pain she felt inside.  The ache in her chest became almost unbearable.  The mixed feelings of hunger and necessary surrender enveloped her every night just before they came.  Ginny hated feeding with intense passion.  She loathed the hunger that claimed her body, but she needed the sustenance, and that awareness surpassed the hate.

Eventually she knew they would stop bringing them to her.  They would expect her to be the predator; track down her own prey and drink without mercy.  She would do it, not because she wanted to, but because each night it became easier to mask her repulsion at what she had become.  She mourned the loss of life for a while, but she was learning to accept it as inevitable, a part of her altered existence.

They told her she didn’t have to kill them; that she could control it, but she didn’t know how.  The hunger was too powerful and all consuming.  The metallic taste on her lips was like a drug, an addiction she couldn’t deny, filling her and giving her strength.  She couldn’t understand the want of control when her every desire was being met at that moment.  But she needed to learn, because the guilt was waning.  If that happened, Ginny knew she would lose that small part of herself that still remained.

On the seventh night they fulfilled her greatest craving and deepest fear.  Hermione had never looked so beautiful or so afraid.  Ginny’s resolve strengthened.  This was the time the control really mattered and she would master it.  She had to.  She ran her hands through her lover’s stubborn curls, inhaling the scent she knew so well.  Her heightened senses deepened her longing.  This time it was real.

One finger trailed down a milky smooth throat.  Skin so lovely it was almost too perfect to mark, but not quite.  Ginny’s lips pressed gently in a kiss meant to soften the pain, but it wasn’t enough.  She could feel the tense shoulders indicating Hermione’s fear, and she tried to reason with her lover’s pleading whispers against her pounding heart.  A strangled moan escaped Hermione’s lips and Ginny felt the girl fall into her embrace as she began to drink from the warmth of her veins.

The taste was intoxicating.  Better than anything she had ever known.  How easy it would be to take her fill, drink until her hunger was completely satisfied, and feel the lovely girl collapse in her arms. 

She had to stop.   Now.  Before it became impossible.  Battling her deepest urges, she pulled away slightly, dipping her tongue into the wound to catch the last coppery taste.  Ginny relaxed and felt her body slump to the floor, pulling Hermione to her side and holding her close.  Her fingers trailed softly over Hermione’s pale face, and she whispered endearments and apologies that would never be heard.  She rested her hand on the sleeping girl’s chest, feeling it rise and fall, knowing she had finally learned; knowing that love was what it took to make it real."
"old obsession. Tom Riddle. Older, changed – with a distinct reptilian aspect which only made him more striking. He hissed tales of death and the existence as a ghost, of what secrets he had uncovered during the years he’d been gone… of how Dumbledore had manipulated him, but was too afraid to let him know too much. He said Harry knew nothing of the true extent of his manipulations.

The low, sensual hisses were tormenting, forever echoing in his head. If Tom Riddle’s sixteen-year-old self had been charismatic, this incarnation of Voldemort was able to weave his words a hundred times better, leaving Harry enraptured with every word as they spilled smoothly from the pale, almost lipless mouth.

They discussed so many things, it was just so easy to talk, forget of all that transpired between them before that Harry often found himself disbelieving that such a charming, intelligent man was a mindless mass murderer without purpose.

 Until the news came that Voldemort had returned… Confused, scared and excited, Harry had to make sure for himself. He threw himself into spying on all of the old Death Eaters, waiting for a chance to tail one of them to a gathering. And there was the Dark Lord, terrifying and cruel as Harry had remembered him, but considerably more sane. Well, Harry’s own standards may have been slipping, but Voldemort seemed much more in control of his emotions and magic than at the height of his second rise to power – in Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts. It felt as though it was a lifetime ago that he watched Cedric Diggory drop lifelessly to the ground and then witness the rebirth of the most powerful Dark Lord of the century.

Voldemort’s eyes seemed to follow him, even under the invisibility cloak. Yet he did nothing, but smirked at Harry, before continuing with the welcoming speech to his minions.

Something strange happened, then. The pain in his scar stopped, vanishing altogether.

The anxiety that was tightening his chest, making it hard to breathe, was replaced with excitement instead. He felt lightheaded and aroused, to the point of his entire body shaking involuntarily. Confused, he fled the old manor, unnoticed by any of the present Death Eaters. He ran straight home, his heart racing.

“Voldemort is back,” was all he could say, his feelings too intense to put into words otherwise. His mind was racing, trying fond find any explanation for the Dark Lord’s return, but unable to make sense of any of it. He reappeared virtually from nowhere, even though almost ten years had passed since Harry had killed Nagini, the last Horcrux and then duelled with Voldemort himself, barely coming out of it alive.

“How?” she choked out, her eyes brimming with barely held back tears. He felt something within him break at the sight of her, unable to move forward to hug and comfort her or say it will all be ok. He didn’t know why he felt so unmoved by her tears or why he didn’t simply tell her he’d seen Voldemort and that he’d suspected he’d been back for months already. His lips formed a thin line, self inflicted silence sealing them firmly. He felt numb and detached under Ginny’s crestfallen gaze, unable to call forth the warm affection he once held for her. So he left, his movements almost mechanical, closing the door behind him to shut out the image of his wife curled up on the bed with tears streaming down her face.

He shut himself away after that, perusing the depths of his mind for answers. Voldemort hovered in his thoughts; in all his dreams and then even every waking moment. He felt haunted, but the Dark Lord’s presence was comforting at times. He revealed to Harry the true extent of Dumbledore’s machinations. He even told Harry how he came to possess a real body once more. The parts of his soul in the Horcrux did not die upon its destruction. It is beyond wizards, even in this day, to eradicate a soul.  Instead, they dissipated, their power lost, but not gone. As long as even one piece of his soul remained living, the others could not leave this world either. He spent a decade as a hopeless ghost, searching for his lost Horcruxes. They were the weak parts of him, parts he wanted to cast out, but he had to welcome them back out of necessity. He merged back with them, slowly regaining the strength to wield his old magic and used an ancient sacrificial ritual to obtain a young, healthy body. It had once belonged to a muggle, but changed upon infusion of his dark powers. With more of his soul back came back the clarity of thinking, his old feelings and memories. He remembered his true purpose behind the hatred of Muggles. None of that mattered to Harry though. Having lived in the wizarding world for almost twenty years, he now truly saw the difference between magic and non-magic human. Muggles treated each other like filth, bred like rabbits and destroyed the very planet they lived on."
"
 


“It’s not Voldemort I’m scared of,” he says to me one evening, when the sky has been veiled with clouds and the earth smells of fresh rain and the plants slowly waking to life after the cold of winter.

“It’s me,” he admits, not daring to look in my direction even now. “It has always been me.”

I would ask, but deep, heavy silence has sealed my lips for what seems like forever.

“It’s the darkness growing inside of me,” he has trouble saying, even though he knows I could not judge. “It’s the part I’ve always shunned, that which craves subjugation.”

I feel one of his tears fall upon me, heavier than the barrage of rain from the night before.

“I went to him willingly,” he grinds out, clenching his hands while his body shivers uncontrollably in the biting cold. “His words, they had crawled inside of me, taking root before I had even noticed. The worst of it is… I believe them now. He was always right, trying to show me the correct path, even when I fought against him with every ounce of my strength.  I used to believe that everyone could be saved. I tried to save you, too… but that’s not how the world works. He tried to warn me, but I was too stubborn to listen until it was too late. I knew that the only way to protect those I love was to run away, to prevent the war, but I didn’t believe him. I wanted to see the best in people.”

His lips twist as an odd, strangled noise escapes him involuntarily.

“But then the Order decided you were too dangerous. Even Voldemort treats his followers better than that. He gives everyone a chance to reach their potential, instead of throwing away the lives of those who are our future. He has plans, you know. For many centuries from now. He will always do what is best for all of us. Maybe not every one of us, maybe not me, but for the World. He won’t ever stop. I could thwart him at every step, I could fight until my wand was broken and my bones turned to dust, it wouldn’t change a bloody thing.

“You see, there’s one thing he has always had that I could never achieve. He believes in himself and in his goals. I’ve never had this conviction. If I did, we wouldn’t be here now. He has showed me how to fight, how to live. All the Order ever wanted was for me to die to save them. I couldn’t do that…. Voldemort, he… understands. Better than anyone ever has. Better than anyone ever will. We were always meant to end up here, I think. We belong together.”

The tears slowly permeating my skin have stopped now. He looks at me, like he can actually see me, standing there.

“I love him, Ginny. And… I’m sorry.”

I watch silently as he turns back to the stone path, vanishing into the distance slowly. My feet lay anchored in the ground, heavy as the earth itself. I wish I could follow Harry one last time.

 "
"I?”  “Ugh, you know he'd be more likely to work with you.” And like that, though the moment of seriousness should not have passed so soon, they were back to their usual banter.  “Is he still bitter over your colors at our first World Cup? Honestly mate, just challenge him to a wand measuring contest and let the matter be done, everyone knows you supported Ireland as a whole and Viktor for his own merits.”  Ron waved a hand dismissively in his direction. “Sure, let's get into a pissing match for the whole Ministry to snicker about. Sorry blighters don’t have enough rumors in the mill as it is?”  Harry sighed.  That, however, was hardly the correct choice of response to a man who went to sleep nursing a headache and woke up drunk instead of the other way around. Ron set his expression the way Ginny would after a row, and under that withering stare Harry held up his hands in surrender.  ""Okay, I'll deal with Rourke."" 

 



Later than expected Harry’s feet carried him before the closed door labeled Emery S. Rourke, Director of Magical Transportation. As expected the man’s wireless was reporting on the finale between Egypt and Bulgaria loudly enough to make out each call clearly, and Rourke’s mutterings underneath when the announcer paused to breath. With such a ruckus Harry did not see much point in knocking. He turned the knob and stepped inside of the wide office overflowing with Quidditch memorabilia and only as many markings of station and books pertaining therein to Portkeys and Floo powder as to satisfy the standard set by Rourke’s predecessors.

“Morning, Emery.” The older wizard, reclined in his seat and staring up at a poster of Ireland on the ceiling overtop the department seal seemed to not hear Harry. I suppose it was for the best that Ron didn't come here today. Unfortunately Harry was also not in the mood to wait around for very long, and when still the director had not acknowledged him even after striding right up to Emery’s desk, Harry drew his wand and silenced the radio.

“-bloody Seeker couldn’t catch a Snitch if it was right underneath his nose--” after a moment Emery’s swearing against Victor Krum paused in mid complaint and he thumped his chair legs back to the carpeted floor, shaking his moppy brown hair into his blue eyes. “What the blazes do you want, Potter? Zaghloul has him on the edge of his wits!”

“Morning, Emery,” Harry repeated dryly. “I need to secure transport for myself and Ron overseas.”

“Oh, that prick?” Rourke scoffed. “Then he can come down here himself unless you’re under orders from the Minister. Now if you would I’d like to return to the match-” and he jabbed at the wireless with his own wand from the folds of a sleeve and the noise returned.

Harry was not amused. “No, we aren’t under orders. This is a personal favor.” He had to raise his voice to be heard, and Rourke waved his hands as if the matter was thus inconsequential compared to the finale and kicked back from his desk again as Egypt scored. It was quite tempting to bewitch the radio to dance through the other stations until it found Celestina Warbeck’s 21 hour tribute to love, but resorting to such a tactic would only be a short lived satisfaction.

One way or another Ron and I are going to be meeting with Charlie tomorrow. Still, he’d rather do this legitimately. A quick Portus might save them a few minutes of wearing down Rourke’s resistance, but crossing the borders would certainly send up sparks somewhere in this and another office and then they’d be receiving a few strongly worded admonishments signed in the Minister’s name at the very least.

He took a slow breath and on the exhale decided to pull a page out of the late Albus Dumbledore’s playbook, and conjured up a large plush armchair. Then he sat down, kicked up his trainers over Rourke’s desk, and folded his arms behind his own head to listen to the match. There were worse ways to spend time than listening to the latest World Cup coming to a close.

For almost half an hour Rourke attempted to ignore him. Harry quietly rooted on Victor and Bulgaria as Rourke swore about both teams, particularly whenever Egypt lost the Quaffle and the score rose in Bulgaria’s favor, on which occasion Harry would whistle softly in appreciation of Victor’s teammates. Rourke kept glancing at him from the corners of his eyes on such moments and his muttering would momentarily pause, then resume with more vigor. Eventually as the hour drew on and the referee called a break following a collision between the Egyptian chaser and one of Bulgaria’s beaters Rourke sat up with a dissatisfied curse.

“Damnation! Alright, Potter, spit it out before the match resumes, and then get the hell out of my office so I can enjoy this in peace!”

Finally. Harry unfolded his arms and lowered his feet to the floor. “We need to be in Bucharest"
"a lot of shit, right? Like, students doing lots of stuff, saying things, trying stuff out, um… experimenting and stuff?” You nod, wondering where on Earth this is going. It almost feels like Malfoy is about to come out to you, which wouldn’t exactly be a surprise, except for why on Earth he would be telling this to you of all people. “So my so… my… my child, Scorpius, came to me today to… talk about something. And…” Malfoy sighs, finishes his beer, and motions for another. You do so, but switch to the lighter (and amusingly named) Kelpie Spit - after all, once you’ve reeled them in, you don’t want them passing out before finishing the story.

He takes a sip and continues. “Have you… have you ever had a wizard come to class, and then the next day, they’re a witch?”

This is not at all what you expected. “You mean, like with a polyjuice potion?” you ask.

“No, not like that,” Malfoy says irritatedly. “I mean -”

“Well, I have heard that stewing and ingesting horklumps during an eclipse on a rainy dew while wearing a particular shade of chartreuse can cause a variety of amusing effects, including a brief reversal of genders -”

“I’m not bloody talking about pickled horklumps!” he spits, making you glad you started him on the lighter stuff. “Stewed,” you mutter under your breath.

“I mean, the wizard shows up to class the next day and he looks pretty much the same, but he says he’s a witch now?”

Ohhhhhhhh. Now you get it. You must say, your experience in such matters is minimal, though a pleasant but not particularly applied (at least in Herbology - Ancient Runes was apparently a different story entirely) Ravenclaw student in h… his fourth year at Hogwarts started asking to be called simply “Alex” instead of “Alexis”. You didn’t think much of it, but you did notice he- him, wearing more male-oriented clothing (though with Hogwarts dress code it’s not like there’s too much of a difference - he’d never been one to wear skirts anyway), and overheard Madame Pomfrey muttering on about cooking up an usual type of potion for Alex (though Madame Pomfrey did a lot of muttering these days, and usually of the not entirely coherent variety). You tend to let your students be students and just focus on their school work unless they come up to you - and while you’ve mentored many a student in your relatively short but varied time as a teacher at Hogwarts, Ravenclaws have been the most reticent to ask for your advice - even more so than the Slytherins! It probably has something to do with your rather convuluted way of explaining some thi- oh shit Malfoy’s talking again.

“Like, I could understand being into wizards. It’s the 21st century. It’s… it’s a new era. Look at me - I’m, I’m a changed man. I don’t…” he pauses, hiccuping slightly, stares confusedly at his hands for a brief moment, and then continues. Yeeaaah, probably just gonna give him water from this point forward. “I don’t call muggleborns mudbloods any more. I don’t. I promise. And like, we’ve all thought about it. No wizard hasn’t. If they say they hasn’t, haven’t, they’re a liar. And not a cool one like me. A... a, whatchamacalit. A dumb one. I mean, we’ve ALL been there, in the showers after a quidditch match, and you jusht HAPPEN to look over and you know maybe you don’t hate what you see!” Malfoy’s hands are really getting into it now, and he’s starting to draw attention from the few remaining bar patrons.

You do your best to hide a snicker - Ron is gonna love this story (on second thought, he might love it too much - maybe you should keep this one to yourself), and Malfoy manages to somehow combine a scowl and a blush into a single gesture. “The point is, I could understand if he, you know, flew for the other team. But this… I mean, I’m obviously not mad or anything, I just… I - I don’t have any, wazzit called, any rame of feference, any fame of deference, any, any… I just don’t quite get it.” He take another drink, and continues, fortunately with slightly less exaggerated hand motions. “Was I… am I… a bad father? Did I do something wrong? Why’s… why’s my beautiful boy got it in his head that he’s a witch?”

Hoo boy. There it is. You… you’re going to be honest, you really have no idea how to respond. Brief encounters with Alex notwithstanding,"
"capable of scoring the same as him if not occasionally higher. He’d tried to talk to Potter a number of times, even to get a rise out of him to get him into trouble, but nothing seemed to phase the young prodigy. He usually just shrugged him off an vanished out of sight. He didn’t seem interested in much of anything, which puzzled the ever-ambitious Slytherin.

“Alright, what proof do you have?” Riddle risked asking, leaning over slightly, eyes narrowed and suspicious.

“I've stored away memories of your conversations around the school. Notes you’ve passed on to your…Knights,” Potter chuckled a little at that, making Riddle scoff. He’d known the name would have to go eventually, but it wasn’t that bad, was it? “I have a few confessions of coercion and blackmail from students too.”

The boy seemed calm, not at all like was accusing him. More like stating a fact, but it really only annoyed Riddle more. How could he be so casual about this? The Slytherin’s entire career and life were on the line here.

“Impossible,” he sneered. It was a bluff, but a good one. He had been careful.

“You’re not as subtle as you think,” Potter said as though he’d anticipated Riddle’s reaction in advance. “I’m curious though. Do you put yourself at risk on purpose?” He titled his messy mop of a head to the side, eyes wide and seemingly innocent.

Riddle’s jaw clenched almost painfully.

“Of course not,” he bit out, growing quickly impatient with this conversation. His wand was just in his sleeve…

“Don’t.” Potter warned, his eyes narrowing just a little. Riddle wasn’t buying his innocent, quiet façade any longer. The kid was smart, observant and sneaky. Why he wasn’t in Slytherin was beyond him. He can’t have tricked the Sorting Hat…? He had underestimated Potter though. He’d let his guard down, thinking he’d had everyone in the school figured out. He’d been careful around the teachers, knowing he couldn’t control them – well, other than Slughorn, the old fool.  “I have taken certain measures to ensure to my safety while I speak to you. If you try anything, the Ministry will know.”

“I see.” Riddle furrowed his brows in concentration, focusing all his brainpower to get a read on Potter. The boy was smart, he’d begrudgingly admit, but he was smarter. “So, you want to turn me in?” He decided to go in for the attack. As good a move as any other at this point.

“I might,” Potter sounded genuinely contemplative for a moment. “I’ll admit, I first set out to catch the rising Dark Lord purely for my own gain,” he admitted without a hint of hesitation, it almost shocked Riddle how easily he admitted to it. “But then I became curious. You’re quite brilliant, you know.” Potter’s burning gaze was unwaveringly studying him for any weakness; Riddle could feel it crawling all over his skin.

“I know,” he nodded with a cocky grin. “But you’re not bad, yourself.” Riddle didn’t really know what had possessed him to switch tactics so suddenly. He felt suddenly uncomfortable under the green eyes’ scrutiny. Potter’s unexpected assault on his position was a welcome intellectual challenge, but the close proximity and the quiet staring were…

“Unnerving,” Potter said suddenly, startling Riddle again. He checked his Occlumency shields quickly, fearing that the brat was reading his mind. “How easily obsessed I get with things that catch my interest,” he continued almost casually. Riddle exhaled shakily, this wasn’t going at all how he’d liked it to. Then the boy picked something out of his pocket. A ring, with carvings in it. Rune carvings. It was his Charms project from the previous year!

“I stole it from the professor before the summer holiday,” Potter shrugged, twirling the little thing in-between his fingers. “It’s quite ingenious. I’d never would have thought to charm it to return to the owner’s pocket the next day, should it ever get lost or stolen.”

“I’m sure you’d have figured out something equally interesting,” Riddle replied somewhat tersely, not intending to make it a compliment, even though it certainly was one. Potter’s lips quirked upwards a little.

“What are you trying to achieve, Riddle?” he asked in that calm tone again, but his eyes sparkled with curiosity.

“Haven’t you figured it out by now?” The Slytherin heir smirked mirthlessly, still tempted to hex the boy into oblivion.

“Of course I have. Every ‘Dark Lord’ wants the same thing, though they use different means to achieve it. I’d like to hear it from you, though.” Potter’s head was"
"he was happily away from them and really they didn’t cross his mind all that much and he would gladly continue ignoring their existence instead of going back to that horrid place.

 

After quickly trying on a few of the glasses, he chose a frame similar to his old one. It was thinner and better made, but the lenses were still round, although smaller and fitted his face better. They didn’t hide his face; instead they framed his eyes nicely. He requested a charm, which would adjust the strength of the lenses, as his eyesight would get worse over time. He paid a total of 45 Galleons (he had been saving pocket money for an occasion such as this) and hurried back. It was already getting late and he knew Sirius would be livid when he found out what he had done. And he would find out. Harry had locked his room under the pretence of hiding the whole day. Sirius wasn’t an idiot though and he’d more than likely have barged in there by now. Breathing in deeply, he steeled himself for the hell that was to come. Not that he regretted it.

Stepping out of the fire, he found the house oddly…silent. The lights weren’t on.

Harry walked through the room carefully, fingering on his wand a bit nervously. Nothing in the hallway, nothing in the kitchen. Silence. His breath seemed loud and his footsteps were almost deafening. Swallowing thickly, he went on as quiet as possible, his wand out. Going up the stairs, he stepped as lightly as he could, trying to stop them from creaking as much as possible. There was no sign of Kreacher or Sirius anywhere. His heart started to beat faster and faster; his breath hitched suddenly when he heard a high pitched noise of a door closing somewhere behind him. He stilled for a moment, straining his hearing, but he couldn’t hear any footsteps. His wand hand was starting to shake a bit, either from fear or holding it up for too long, perhaps both. It was dark and he could barely see, every shadow he could see out of the corner of his eyes seemed to be moving, just waiting to jump out at him. Heading towards Sirius’ room, he was desperately willing his whole body to stop shaking, with little success. He was going past his own room when he noticed that the door was open, only slightly. He pushed it open slowly and hesitantly, still not daring to make any noise. The things in his room were knocked over all over the place and the curtains had been ripped off the window together with the rail they’d been hanging on. It was a very unpleasant sight and Harry gulped loudly, the skin on his neck breaking out in cold sweat.

 


It was dark, his Aunt and Uncle were asleep. Dudley too. It was late and he was tired…very tired…his hands were blistered and they felt like they were burning, he’d been scrubbing the kitchen clean all night…his eyelids were falling shut…if he could just sleep for a little while…he shook his head and splashed his face with some cold water. He needed to make the kitchen sparkling clean or else his Aunt would shout at him and tell him how useless he is, a useless freak just like his father and mother…and then Uncle would whip his hands again…if he was lucky…he continued cleaning the gap between the floor and the oven thoroughly, but his hands were so sore already, he could hardly feel them. Only a few more hours and he would be locked in his cupboard again and able to sleep. His Uncle wanted him out of the way while they had guests, so he’d likely not be allowed back out until late the next night. He should probably sneak a little bit of food into his cupboard now, or he wouldn’t get anything to eat for an entire day. He groaned quietly. It was unfair, Dudley could eat all he wanted and then sweets too…while all he got were leftovers. His Aunt always said that was all he deserved and that he should be grateful for whatever they gave him. But today he had seen some other kids at school being picked up by their mums… he was sure none of them were up at three in the morning, cleaning the kitchen while their families slept. He couldn’t help but think it was unfair…suddenly he felt he wasn’t alone anymore. There were eyes watching him in the darkness somewhere…he shuddered, fear taking over. He got to his feet and looked into the shadows behind him…he turned around again and suddenly a pair of hands landed on his shoulders…and then all over him…he didn’t even know what was happening, he couldn’t see…then his hair was pulled back and his Uncle’s face appeared beside him, his moustache grazing Harry’s ear
 roughly. He muttered something 
that Harry didn’t quite understand and 
a fat hand cupped his backside…



 


A hand was placed on his shoulder. He"
"Is there a reason why you omitted to clean it, or are you simply lazy? Perhaps you're attempting to turn the spiders into mutated pets."" He crossed his arms firmly over his chest, and Draco felt his balls twinge in a way that nearly sent him to his knees.

In all honesty, he didn't remember any cauldron. They had been working on a weak version of the licorice-tasting potion Severus had added to his tea a few weeks past and he thought that he had cleaned up after himself when Severus wrapped himself up and stalked off to sell it with only a bit of Polyjuice and a glamour hiding exactly who he was. He was almost certain of it, but there was something about the way he asked it that made Draco feel very much like a naughty boy who had definitely done something he shouldn't have or, more to the point, something he should. ""I, I thought that I had cleaned it, I could have sworn...."" His mouth went dry even as he spoke.

""Don't argue with me, Mr. Malfoy."" Oh god, that sounded good, that snapped growl, that tension as Severus stepped forward in a quick fury to haul him up out of his chair.

The utterly mortifying squeak that he gave would have been embarrassing if they had been in public. As it was, he somehow managed not to whimper. Somehow. He was uncertain exactly how he succeeded in that, but there it was. ""No, sir. Of course not, sir.""

""Good. Good."" His fingers flexed, and his eyes remained fixed on Draco. ""How are you going to rectify this, Mr. Malfoy?""

He couldn't help swallowing. He just couldn't. ""However you like, sir. However you say.""

Severus was quiet for a moment, wound up tight in himself as if he were the headmaster again, and Draco remembered that time with a tight shudder as he started to loosen his hold of Draco. ""On your knees.""

Easiest thing he had ever done, that, and he dropped to them slowly, the left one banging a bit too hard against the sitting room carpet. He didn't bother saying anything at all, just looked up at him, eyes wide, hands shaking. ""Sir.""

He watched as Severus looked down his nose at him, peering, judging -- judging everything, likely, judging his posture, the position of his hands on his lap, of... ""You may suck me.""

Oh, Merlin, Morganna and Dallben, that was... Draco reached up, fingers shaking as he worked to open dark trousers. He had no idea how he managed to do it but then Severus was out, hot and heavy and hard in his hand, and he took him into his mouth, the weight of his cock and the salt and musk of him on his tongue and he couldn't stop himself from moaning.

All he got for it was an approving hum, but he could feel Severus harden, lengthen, a comfortable fullness in Draco's mouth before he started to thrust slowly. It was all about taking what he wanted, about Draco giving in because Severus said, because he had control and he could do what he liked when he liked. Just thinking it made him moan around that turgid flesh and his heart beat frantically with the excitement. The thing was that Severus fucked his head just as well as his body. Not everyone could do that but oh.

Oh.

It was good when it happened, and Severus did it regularly and often. The head of his dick pressed against the roof of Draco's mouth, and then he shoved in deeper, all the way in. ""Good, good boy...""

Good, and he was almost choking, so close, could barely manage it at all. His eyes watered sharply and his hands fluttered against Severus's thighs, wild and importunate. The sounds he made were desperate and pleading and they didn't help anything.

Severus pulled back, and he gasped air in through his nose, briefly, before he thrust in again -- it wasn't so much to make it easier for Draco to breathe as it was because Severus liked the feel of it, the way his throat tried closing, the hot wet suction that he just barely managed around the push of him. One hand threaded into his hair, clenching tightly, and he pulled back again so that Draco could try and gasp.

Fuck.

Fuck, and he was going to come without even being touched because Severus was fully in his space, full-on Professor, and just the thought made him whimper.

Getting throat fucked by Professor Snape was a special kind of treat . Fingers tugged at his hair, pulled him onto Severus's dick one more time, harder, until he was struggling to breathe again, fighting not to bite down, all because that was what Severus wanted and so that was exactly what Draco was going to give him.

When Severus came, it was sudden, and he was so deep in Draco's throat that he couldn'"
", if that was what Severus expected. Being bound changed things, was entirely different from the times that he was told to hold his arms and legs where they were placed, to keep his mouth quiet, which took so much thought.

""All yours."" He couldn't help murmuring it because he was. It was true. Had been true, and would continue to be true for as long as he breathed.

Maybe even after he stopped.

""I didn't ask you to reaffirm it,"" Severus noted lightly. He slid his fingers down Draco's wrist, clutching loosely. It was all teasing and suggestion, tight grips following after a moment, past his elbows.

The touch of those stained fingers never failed to excite him, to make him want things that once upon a time he hadn't had the right to want. Hadn't known how to ask for it, but now it was his, all his, and that was something, too.

And he asked -- god what he needed, not what he wanted. Fingers curled under his chin, lingering and slow after Severus's hand finished traveling down his arm, a counterpoint to the fingertips scratching a line just below his navel. It all made him feel desperately indulged and sensitive, ripe to the possibilities unfolding beneath the faintly blue light of the moon. The stone was warm beneath him, the air cool above him, and everywhere that Severus touched him was a path of pure shivering sensation.

There was no expectation that he lie there and do anything but take it, feel what was happening to him. It felt good, leisurely, idle scratching that made its way down slowly to the base of his cock.

Stars.

Stars and moon and Severus, warm, dexterous fingers, and it was unsurprising when he felt the press of lips against the flat of his belly, the skin over his hip. It made him feel languorous, and slightly unreal, perhaps, and he had no words for it. Not even a sound, although he expected that wouldn't last.

Just, no sounds yet. He closed his eyes briefly, concentrated on just feeling it. The light scrape of fingernails up the inside of his thigh. ""Incendio.""

The sound of the spell startled him, made Draco's breath stutter in his chest as his eyes flicked to the candle to the side of the altar. It was squat and wide, and one of Severus's fingers traced along the edge, making it fascinating. The flame flickered briefly in a faint breeze before burning steady and bright, tainting the moonlight with its yellow glow. ""Oh.""

""Quite. Do you like the look of it?"" He smirked a little, and it made Draco wonder what was coming next for him. It didn't matter; he would give in to whatever it was, would be willing. Would do his best to respond, and that was all Severus expected.

""Yes."" Yes, and he nodded, lashes dropping so that he could see the spark of light through the dark blond fringe of them.

""Good."" He swiped fingers through it, and then smudged the warm wax against Draco's hip. ""How does that feel?""

Nice. Warm and slick and Draco shifted, entire body moving and arching into that touch just so. He licked his lips and nodded, slow and serious. ""Perfect."" Not enough but... perfect.

""Good."" Severus reached for the wide candle, wrapped his fingers around it, and brought it over Draco's body. There was a hint of menace, and Draco could guess that what came next was hot wax, wherever Severus wanted it. The where didn't matter, not really. There was a reason Draco was the one draped over the altar stone, after all, and it wasn't because he wanted to make those calls. Not really, and so he took a slow, deep breath, licked his lips and closed his eyes.

Waited, and waited, and waited, but he still wasn't ready for the hot drizzle of wax, a thin stream, pouring over the tip of his hard cock.

Fuuuck. Fuck, and he couldn't keep himself from whimpering, biting his tongue and moving, a twisting-pushing-moving-away kind of motion that couldn't be helped. ""Nn!""

Nowhere to go from it, nowhere to escape from it, just hot wax all over him, a slow steady pour that splashed onto his hips and his balls, that invaded soft sensitive skin. ""Still good?""

Yes. Yes and no, because he felt too much and not enough, and the garbled sentence that he managed to mumble out was most likely completely incoherent. It wasn't as though he had to be aware of anything beyond what Severs was doing to him, and that was just fine with Draco.

""Pinned down, just for me,"" Severus murmured, and Draco heard more words, heard them slip in and out as he felt more hot wax hit his skin, encasing his dick.

Just for him, only"
