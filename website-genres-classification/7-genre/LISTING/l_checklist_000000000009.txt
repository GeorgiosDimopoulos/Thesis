                	     Buying your first       home? See the page devoted to first time home buying.	         
                	     Familiarize yourself with the mortgage process. Have mortgage questions? Need a few       mortgage tips? See the sections devoted to those subjects.	         
                	     Begin the application process by getting prequalified and preapproved       from a Mortgage Lender. Do this first. Your Agent will need your mortgage qualification, and it will significantly       strengthen your offer when you find a home. At Lending Tree, you can submit a quick and       easy application, and within 2 business days get up to 4 offers from lenders so that you can compare terms and rates.	         
                	     Get your financial       picture in focus as soon as possible. Since it is an important       component, be aware of your credit situation. You can get a free copy of your credit report       or, see the credit center       for additional resources for getting your credit report.	         
                	     The best time to work on your budget is before you move. Want to maximize your financial picture? See the section devoted to       budget hints.	         
                	     Wondering about how much time is needed to buy a home? See the sample homebuying timeline.	         
                	     Find an Agent       that you trust. It is important to do this before you go rushing off looking for homes or you may end up with no       representation. See the Agency and Buyer       Agent pages for important discussions regarding "who represents       who." Looking to find an Agent? Click here to choose an Agent in your area.
