I have been at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center since 1980. A recurring theme has been inventing technology to enhance creativity, collaboration, and human expression. This theme has taken me from research on knowledge systems, to collaboration technology, to trusted systems for digital publishing, and now to sensemaking technology.

I am now a research fellow at PARC and manager of the Human-Document Interaction Area in the Information Sciences and Technology Laboratory. I am also an adjunct member of the Secure Document Systems Area in the Computer Science Laboratory. 

I have not put my current research projects on the "external" PARC web. My research on sensemaking started in June 1999. My main work between 1993 and 1999 was in developing technology for digital property rights -- leading to ContentGuard.and also founding the Secure Document Systems area for computer security research at PARC.
