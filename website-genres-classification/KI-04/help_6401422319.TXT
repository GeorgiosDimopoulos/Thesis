Please double-check everything in this FAQ before you let it influence your thinking, there is a possibility that I have got something wrong - please inform me if so is suspected (be specific). If you are ill - you should see a physician, this FAQ is not intended to replace a physician. However you can read about symptoms / possible diseases, as a complement. 

Hg = Mercury.
 CNS = Central Nervous System.
