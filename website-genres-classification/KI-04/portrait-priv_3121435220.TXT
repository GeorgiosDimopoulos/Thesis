Postdoctoral Research Fellow 
  

 	 	

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Scientific Interests: 

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Nadia Rosenthal, where I work on skeletal muscle.  I am interested in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, repair and disease, and the pathways associated with these states.
