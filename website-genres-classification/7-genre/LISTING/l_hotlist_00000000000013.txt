HENRY'S DANCE HOTLIST
Welcome to Henry Neeman's Dance Hotlist! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Send me links! I add new links and make corrections as I hear about them, so if you want to tell me about a link, send me mail at hneeman@ou.edu. Please write to me in English only, since that's the only language I know. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't give me a URL, I won't list it. I've had a number of inquiries about putting up Web pages for various groups. Sorry, I can't; I have neither the resources nor the time. For those of you who are less familiar with the Web, please note that this site has almost no content, just links to other sites around the world. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry, no stripping links! Please don't ask me for help in finding exotic dancing venues. They are outside the scope of this Hotlist. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Surf the links! A lot of these links have indices of their own, so if you can't find what you want, click on something similar and see what's available. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My former officemate, Tom Abel, keeps a page of access statistics for this webserver. This Hotlist is more popular than any of the pages this server was intended for, by about a factor of eight. Also, weekly accesses to this page have doubled since Tom started collecting statistics in March 1996. 
I'm so proud.
