Update - 2/18/2004 - I fixed a bunch of the files in the Fun Stuff section so they should hopefully all work now. If you find a broken link, let me know. Have fun!
Update - 1/21/2004 - OK... some of the updates have made their way up. I posted some photos from the Holiday season as well as a bunch of pics from our New Year's gig down at Sloppy Joe's in Key West, Florida. I also posted 5 more movies and a bunch more games to the Fun Stuff section. I told ya I'd update the site... yeah!
