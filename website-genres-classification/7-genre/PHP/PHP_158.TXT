Please feel free to wander around. To see my Photograph Album, follow the 'Photos' link from the 'About me' page. You can read about some of my interests by using the 'Interests' link. My take on topical issues, mainly from a British domestic perspective, is in my 'Comment' section (see link at left), which also gives access to my 'Newsfeed' from Moreover, a convenient way of keeping up with breaking news in a timely manner. My comments are updated regularly, and earlier comments may be viewed in linked 'archive' pages. You can do a websearch using the Google search box available on my 'Links' page. The 'Int. Rel.' link is to pages about the UK's major international relationships and from there you will find links to various relevant websites. My 'Graphics' library includes themed images and buttons which you are welcome to use. The 'Terrorism' link will take you to memorial pages for those lost in recent acts of terrorism. The 'Atkins' link will take you to a section which discusses my experiences (very successful!) with the Atkins diet.

Site last updated: Friday 18th June 2004 ~ See below for details of "What's New?" ~
Here you'll find brief details of recent additions or changes to my website; the most recent updates are shown in black print. Please click on the link you want to find in the right-hand column.
European Union - Croatia added to list of candidates for membership 
18 June 2004 - Announcement made in Brussels during the 2-day EU summit currently underway there. At the time of writing, the EU 'enlargement' website has not been updated to reflect this new development, but the BBC has a report on the matter here; read also my 'blogger' comment today - link below.(The link on the right is to my own EU section)
Atkins diet - Weekly and four-weekly weight-loss table 
16 June 2004 - I have added a page showing my weight loss for weekly and four-weekly periods from when I began doing 'Atkins' in June 2003 until end-May 2004. The file is in '.PDF' format - if your PC is not set up to read this, you can download a free copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader by clicking here. Both this link, and that in the box to the right open in new windows - simply close to come back here. If you want to visit my full section on 'Atkins', click on the main link in the column to the left.
Weekly and 4-weekly weight-loss
Atkins diet - Fibre / Psyllium Husks 
10 June 2004 - I have added a page on this subject in the section on 'Atkins' because of its importance in ensuring a healthy digestion. Psyllium husks are not widely available in the UK (except perhaps in health food stores), so I give information about sources. If you want to visit my full section on 'Atkins', click on the main link in the column to the left.

Bill's Comment 
All new comment is posted to my 'blogger' site (http://billcameron.blogspot.com). All postings here, upto 31 March 2003, remain on-line - click on the 'Archives' link at right. 
However, apart from the change to the way I post 'Comment', this remains my main website and will be updated from time to time as in the past.
Key (*) My 'Comment' pages contain comment on topical events; this is expressed occasionally in robust unambiguous terms, but (as with my whole website) does not include profanity - ever. Nevertheless, I recognise that there is a remote possibility that some readers might find that some of the views expressed are objectionable; you should bear this in mind  when deciding whether to view these pages.	
 Do drop by again to see my regular updates, which I hope you find of interest. All feedback is welcome - please click on the 'Feedback' link.
