DIRO Simula home

---------------------------------------------------------------------

At the Université de Montréal, we recently ( 1994-1998 ) used Simula as the basic language to teach programming. This Web site was created at that time to help counteract the lack of information, software and support for the language. Since then, our department got overwhelmed by the Java Tidal Wave and Simula is only used peripherally. It is small consolation to us Simula fans that all students who were exposed to the language feel Simula would have been a much better base than C++ from which to develop "Java". [ Update - jan 2000; Now back to the original text ] 

We had been using Simula in simulation courses since 1970 when we found it bundled on our CDC computer. Simula was also used for the main case study in our advanced OS course. This case study, which involves writing an operating system for a simulated computer, has been with us for over 20 years. 

At the time, we thought Simula too exotic to use for basic programming; however, the recent OO craze (early 90's) made us re-evaluate OO languages (including Simula) for teaching. To our surprise, Simula turned out to be head and shoulders better than the competition in terms of simplicity, power, security and stability. To be fair, we should say that we did find it weak in 3 areas: availability of teaching material (books & cheap implementations), interactive graphics and popularity. 

Lately, thanks to the efforts of Bjorn Kirkerud and others in Oslo, the situation is being rectified: Kirkerud's text book, distributed by Addison-Wesley, is widely available, his WindowTools Class allows use of GUIs in beginners' programs and the CIM compiler (SIMULA in C) means that anyone can teach and program in Simula. A port of CIM to the Windows environment is also available. 

This Simula Home site is designed to help on the teaching & popularity front by providing (eventually) a complete on-line reference as well as useful Web Pointers and access to Simula application software. Presently, the most significant information here is a complete set of syntax graphs that we have generated from the BNF rules.

Association of Simula Users: ASU 

The ASU is presently housed at the ISIMA, Université Blaise Pascal in Central France. This will be the site of the next Simula User's conference on 15th-17th July 1996. [Note: this site has a lot of fancy graphics and has been found to be quite slow ] 

Interesting SIMULA sites

Dep. of Informatics   (IFI), Oslo 

This is an important FTP site for SIMULA. The important   directories are:   
  
* The examples from B.    Kirkerud's book   
* CIM: the public (and portable) SIMULA compiler based on C.   
* Simula (Cim) system for DOS & OS/2 { Updated dec. 1995 }   
* Simulatools    including windowtools an easy interface to X;    settools: standard datastructures and their    operations; and utilities. 

Simula Mailing Center 

A List of 100+ Simula users 

Manfred Schneider's Object-Orientation Site

Over 5400 links including a whole section on SIMULA.  
* French version  
* Simula Page 

The Wageningen Agricultural University, Holland   
This site has a C++ library Libfenk meant to ease the transition from Simula to C++.   The site also mirrors the OSLO CIM site; furthermore, it has the 4.07 macSimula from Lund,    the old DISCO (discrete+continuous)   simulation package from Roskilde and some notes on simula, tools and compilers.   The contact for the C++ library is Peter Barneveld
