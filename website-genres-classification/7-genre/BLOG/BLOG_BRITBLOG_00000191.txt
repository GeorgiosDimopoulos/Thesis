My Blog Home Page
Hello! Everyone's doing a blog page and I haven't got one yet... so here it is! Whoopedy-doo-da :-) You can find the first entries for my blog at the bottom of the page. I must tell you a little bit about myself first though.
Name: Hannah
Sex: Female (what a surprise!)
DOB: For my privacy - can't tell you
Appearance: short black hair, dark green eyes, 5"7 (i think!), 9 stone... now this all sounds a bit shallow so i'll stop it
Marital Status: Taken (sort of, sort of not)
Family: two sisters, a mom, a dad, a cat and 2 rabbits! 
Lives: West Midlands, UK. I live in a house which has a long garden which backs onto the canal. We used to have a boat moored there, most of my childhood holidays were spent going up and down "the cut" on our boat. Going up and down locks also - have you ever seen the walls of locks up close? there is this little insect thing, it looks a bit like a woodlouse upside down. I always remember that insect - funny how you remember small things like that. Locks are smelly too.
Occupation: Business owner of http://www.luxury-leather-goods.com. Although it is tough sometimes, so i'm aiming to get a part time job too. I love being my own boss though, I love to get my head really buried into my work and i believe that in a subordinate position you don't really have the control to really transform what you do and make it something special. Perhaps you can prove me wrong? It does bring it's financial insecurities though - sometimes i just wish i had a regular paycheck!
Likes: I'm way too materialistic, i just love nice things and that's probably why i earn a living selling things! Couldn't think of anything better then spending your money on something nice. I used to be a designer... art and designing is something i like also. Because i know the amount of work it takes in creating something that is beautiful yet useful, i can tell when something is of very good quality.
I'm also a computer addict of course... nothing's more exciting then seeing loads of nice things online! Generally I like most things that are classy. Can't stand gaudy, tacky or sleazy stuff. Ugh.
Feels: Fairness, fairness fairness is important. But fairness must come with discipline - i feel it's important to do what is right rather then what feels right. Discipline means you can be fair but it mustn't come with rebellion. I guess this makes me a bit unemotional. Sometimes it is good to feel sympathetic, but along with sympathy comes the need to undertake action to stop feeling upset about something - it's answers you want not tears?
Religion: Christian - die hard bible fan. I read the bible every day... of course the prophesies are my favourite. What attracted me to God was the fact that no one else believes in him - you can tell something's good when no one else wants to know about it. Humans have this predetermined inclination to do what is bad of course! And the bible tells us what we should be doing whether we like it or not. It's what keeps a person grounded - you should read the bible. The biggest mistake is to think that God and Jesus have no presence today. Things have changed in one way, but in a big way, everything is the same as it always has been. In other words, they're watching and acting in the same ways as they did in the good old days.
Favourite Colours: Yellow first, and then chocolate brown. I hate pink most times - it's deplorably girly i'm afraid.
Favourite Animals: Big stripy tigers, because they are just so powerful and amazing. I love most animals. Of course because we back onto the canal we have *loads* of ducks, especially mallards. They are absolutely hilarious when they start arguing.. one holds onto the other's tail while he swims around to get rid of him! they are very noisy and just great personalities.
Favourite Clothes : Corsets! They look great with a cardigan.
Television: I don't like most television soaps. Unfortunately my sister watches everything that is classed as the slippy alkaline stuff so we have to suffer. I hate eastenders in particular, i always make sure i check out pat butcher's latest brassy earrings though if i have to endure it. It amazes me her ears haven't sagged down at the weight of them! whoa they are big. She should put some suspenders on her ears to hold them up!
Not a big film fan either... i only tend to watch t.v. for music channels and they're not that good either! I guess i am a "mouse potato" which is the alternative word for a computer "couch potato"! The computer is where you will find me.
