Spelling Reform Proposals and Reformed Spellings

I add a link to any proposal that I come across. Most ov these links are root and branch proposals. This is probably not typical ov most campaigners for reform. The Simplified Spelling Society voted recently, quite heavily, for a staged reform on the basis that anything too radical had not a snowballs chance ov getting accepted.

* Ugh-free Spelling This is a sensible, well thought out, first stage reform. There are things not to my taste but that's not important - this a reform that could really happen.

* freespelingVoting on individual words is not likely to produce a coherant reform but the point is, if I understand it right, to get things moving.

* Cut Spelng Leaflet A little sparse but it is very easy to read even if you don't know the rules. One ov the options backed by the simplified spelling society. 

* The initial teaching alphabet Not strictly speaking a reform but i.t.a. is the closest we'v got to actually implementing a phonemic alphabet.

* A rashnalized spelling sistim for dhe Ingglish langwij Yet another root an branch reform but then as a skeptic he doesn't claim to want it to succeed.

* Learning to Spell English The Spellright System 

* Fanetiks A root and branch proposal. Includes discussion ov the problems that need to be faced by any reform proposal.

* Phonetic English A root and branch proposal. Uses numbers to distinguish homonyms.

* Simplified Spelling -or- Phonetics for Fanatics Another root and branch reform.
