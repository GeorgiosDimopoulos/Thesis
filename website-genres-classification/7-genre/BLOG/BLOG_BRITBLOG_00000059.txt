Erratic & City Life  
Okay, I've had a few comments from people who read the blog - that since moving that I don't really blog anymore......... Which is very true.Okay, where will I start?New years was awsome, got very drunk - spent the night in a really funky and kewl studio appartment, and didn't go to sleep until 10 pm new years day! Had an awsome night out at the works new year do, went to Sankey Soap afterwards and stuff and had an awsome night out.... Well worth it!Got myself a regular partner, nothing serious.Enjoying the club life (maybe a bit too much)..... and looking forward to next friday/saturday night!Moving into a flat soon too, end of this month to be in fact.more to come soon! posted by Gerwyn at 4:14 PM 0 comments

Post Christmas  
Well, it ended up being a white Christmas after all... A very seasonal touch!Christmas day was as usual, a quiet family affair. The usual suspects as gifts. Which has left me more determined not to celebrate Christmas coventionally next year... I'm going to celebrate Christmas somewhere hot, sunny and warm!Here I come!Had a wail of a time with T, A and D, good food, good company and a little dare in our local store which helped our jollities no end with the Cops 'n Robbers chase down Porthmadog high street, round the industrial estate, round and round the KwikSave car park, with the jellybeans and various sweets purchased earlier and culminating at the Happy Chop Suey roundabout!I should also apologise to those left in S&C pub who had to endure our cruel song selection on the juke box that included Cliff Richard, The Cheeky Girls and such musical tripe after we sensibly left!!!Anyhow 5 days home, and I'm dying to get back to city life! More cosmopolitan and things to do! Manchester here I come back! YAY!So, what have you all been upto whilst celebrating Christmas? Give me an email or comment below!Toodles! posted by Gerwyn at 11:55 PM 0 comments

Hey Ho!  
Well, since my last post I have accomplished the following ;= Got a job= Got somewhere to live= Made some new mates= Had a very drunken night in Harvey Nicks= A sleazeball stole my cards (should have the cops visiting his house soon)= Found a permament place to live= Been drunk a couple of times on the weekend= Started going to the gym again every day! = Planning to do the Manchester Great Race - 10 kmAnd much more, which I won't obviously go into too much detail on here now! hehe!Went back last night to North Wales on a flying visit, and how knackering - especially with a night out afterwards!Looking forward to Christmas; so I can see family and friends on Boxing day for our traditional catchup. So, if you're about at Christmas, we'll probably meet at the Castell for a quick one and move onto Llanfrothen for a nice bite...Anyhow, I don't at present have internet connection, so can only post hap-hazardly as and when I get the chance, best thing to do is text me or ring me...Toodles everyone!Gerx posted by Gerwyn at 10:11 AM 0 comments

The New Era!  
Okay, here's a quick round up - I've moved to Manchester - and if you've got a position vacant, please email me! (details on the contact page ).Donna's employer is no more and has finally closed. Very unfortunate.Eleri's gone to the bright lights too (same weekend as me), thereby leaving Tegwen as the sole remainder at home..... bless her!I know we'll all meet up again at Christmas time for a quick drink and catch up.Had a new phone, a lovely Sony Erikson E700i - don't worry, the number's still the same!Had a lovely meal with D, L, S at the Goat prior to leaving North Wales. Good times.Also must mention the company night out - will email you all the pics soon!TTFN, need bed!Ger posted by Gerwyn at 10:16 PM 0 comments

End of an era - the weekend.....  
Friday was D's last day at work, and it felt very strange to see a good friend I had met at work leave.. But as they do say, people do move on.It'll feel very strange at work on Monday, with her desk empty.D's leaving do was a small affair - the usual cackle of friends, which resulted us being one of the last ones to leave the restaurant, and spending most of the night laughing (as we always do) and having a wail of a time.But it suddenly dawned on me, out of the four of us, I was the only one still working at the company where we all met.That is, until my contractual notice ends at work. Yes folks I've handed in my notice at work - I'm moving on to pasutures new! I'll keep you all updated on what's happening right here.But that's not the end of it, Eleri and I spent the Saturday night around town savouring the delights of the nightlife (including witnessing at least 3 fights, glasses being smashed, 2 people being chucked out of the local pubs, underage drinkers [what we believed to be looking like 12 year olds], cheesy music, funny local folk to name a few) as our leaving do.It's hard to believe that a little while ago Eleri and I contemplated running a pub here... What were we thinking?!Dafydd has just moved to the big smoke, Eleri's moving shortly with her employer to her old stomping ground and well, that leaves Tegs and me... Well, I think I've reached my mid twenties crisis already, and have opted to move to my favourite city, so here I come!!!!!!!!!! Woo yay!I bumped into a slightly inebriated work colleague on the Saturday night, J was asking me why I was leaving, and could not/did not believe me when I gave him my reasons - that I fancy a change. He thought that there was an alterior motive and seemed devistated when there wasn't. I wonder if he'll remember by tomorrow morning.On a different note...I'm kinda woried about Donna, with her employer experiencing 'difficulties'. I hope it all goes better for them and the takeover, but it does say something when the local enterpirse agency goes into voluntary liquidation with many a creditor (with almost all of them SME's that they were supposed to be helping...).Anyhow, I'm off to bed, another day awaits, and I can't wait to see what it may bring............ Good night everyone out there, sleep well, and don't have nightmares.Gerx posted by Gerwyn at 8:51 PM 0 comments

Hey hey! I'm back!  
Hey folks!I'm back online and so is my blog & website!As you can see from my previous post, I had a 'Cyber Stalker'......Which was a pain, and the only way I could see to discourage him/her was to take my whole site and blog down - and it worked!Unfortunately the above said stalker was using items in my blog to get to me, and as such I'm going to be slightly more cautious on what I blog and my contact details will be changed. But alas, from this doom and gloom I had a nice blog vacation and had the chance to upgrade my server with lots of nice bandwidth!I also have got a new design and features coming right back soon!I'm also going to create a new blog about my nut allergy and living with it - and will post this up soon too...... posted by Gerwyn at 5:28 PM 0 comments
