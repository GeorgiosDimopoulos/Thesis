re: msmsgs and firewall Thursday, August 21, 2003 at 9:53 am Windows XP Annoyances Discussion Forum Posted by Ammo [ find other messages by Ammo ] Yes I would like to know how this service got installed. Is it viral? In XP Pro's Local Area Connection, click the Advanced tab then check the click-box to enable Internet Connection Firewall. I did this because I was fighting the Blaster worm. At the bottom of that tab is the "Settings..." button. Which opens Advanced Settings which lists the services that Internet users are allowed to access on your computer, whether HTTP or FTP etc. The only one turned on was called "msmsgs 11948 TCP" which said that the computer at IP address 207.6.153.100 was allowed to use msmsgs.exe on my computer through TCP port number 11948. Now I know where the annoying Messenger pop-ups are coming from! And I expect unchecking that box will disable them. What good is the Messenger service anyway?
