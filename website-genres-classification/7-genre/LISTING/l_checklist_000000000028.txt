Personal Property and Local Taxation Requirements
 In Maryland, businesses must pay an annual tax based on the value of their personal property (furniture, fixtures, tools, machinery, equipment, etc.). The Department of Assessments and Taxation administers the valuation process while the counties and towns collect the tax based on the location of the property.
 
The Department automatically registers corporations, limited liability companies, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships for this tax when these legal entities form. All other businesses (sole proprietorships, general partnerships) that own or lease personal property or need a business license are required to: 1) obtain an identification number by registering with the Department of Assessments and Taxation, and 2) file an annual personal property return.

Check County and Local Zoning Requirements
