the laundress cometh 
Ok, I hate someone else, so maybe this should be an 'I hate my....' blog. I have decided I hate my neighbor lady across the hall. This woman is a freak! First off she does laundry all the time. I have nickmnamed her 'the laundress' and 'the washer woman'. She is washing something constantly!Now perhaps, if she had a brood of screaming slop nosed children, I could understand, but it is just herself and her grown daughter who is about my own age. How does this woman generate so many dirty linens? She does wash on a 24/7 basis. Where once upon a time, I had no problemo getting a shot at the sole machine on our floor, now, it is occupado all the time, and always, of course, when I need to use it the most. Now, I only ever need to do wash 2,3, or sometimes four times a month, but this lady has that machine going round the clock it seems. I wonder if she is running an underground laundry for hire service.

In the name of the father.............the son.....and...the holy ghost 
I have no motivation to go to Church (am I supposed to capitalize that 'c?') anymore. For this I am slightly saddened, but the whole experience has ceased to move me. Actually the last time any form of worship moved me was when I was 18 and in catholic school and even then, it was our graduation ceremony and really I was just happy high school was over and I would now be venturing into the 'world of adulthood' (stupid ass! childhood really is the best of times...). But, on my own, later on, I discovered an 'alternative' church. I met a lot of interesting people there, was made to feel at home, took over the task of their website, but, since the summer have been left with the spiritual equivalent of an empty plastic bag blowing across the highway, hoping not to get caught under the hot exhaust pipe of a passing car. What do I do? I spent more money in Vegas (that I really didn't have anyhow), then I gave to this church all year. Where once I looked forward to the theatrics of worship, now I dread it and find nary the time to participate. I feel so vacuous.

My internet boyfriend doesn't love me anymore 
My internet boyfriend and I have grown apart. I can see it, hear it and feel it. I think he thinks less of me because I have decided to drop out of the workforce. I have often felt we are defined more by what we do versus who we are. This is proof positive once more that we are valued by occupation. I am saddened by this, but I stick by my choices and will soldier onward. Alone or otherwise.

He who laughs last...Laughs 
I hate my ex-neighbor. I hate that she had a better position at the publishing company than me, I hate that she was younger and dressed in better rags. So now, I am unemployed and left to leaving drunken wine inspired rants on her voicemail. She doesn't know me, I was the sediment under her shoe. I was overjoyed when they raised her rent and she moved out of my apartment building. I no longer have to see her and her equally pompous male compatriots. I no longer have to bear witness to her 'fabulous life.' Who amongst us has the last laugh?

What does it take? 
I don't have a flat mate I hate. I wish I did, perhaps then I'd be a blog of note. I don't know anything more than you about politics, about the democrats or republicans. All I have is me. The day to day grind, the misery and the ocassional whimper of joy. What does it take, a gimmick I suppose, and that I do not have.

Enough! 
I can't do it any longer. I can not work at another dead end, life and spirit sucking mindless occupation. I've tried to play by the rules. I went to college, got straight A's, joined clubs and became involved. For what? A life of call centers and lifeless clerical positions where mis-managers watch every move, question every decision and time the bathroom breaks. So to you, work-a-day world, I say, FU! To every manager I've ever had the misfortune of being paired under I say F-off! This is not what I planned. This was not part of the grand scheme. This is not the pursuit of happpiness. Sometimes, I want to Hunter S. Thompson it all and say, this isn't a fun ride, let us get off now! But I don't, for I am a coward. But I refuse to work and toil away the best and most useful time of my dysfunctional life for you, the employer, to make you rich, fat and happy. For you I say, sod off!

Soup, It's what's for dinner.

mmm...mmm...good 
The Philadelphia press have come up with a new reason why the Eagles lost the Super Bowl. Donovan McNabb was feeling ill. Some reports had him with a head injury about to vomit right there on the field toward the end of the fourth quarter. The latest self-proclaimed spokesman of the Eagles, Freddie Mitchell, said Donovan was so sick he couldn't call the one of the last plays of the game, so Freddie stepped in and took over. Good thing they have Freddie.Well now the mystery of Donovan has been clarified, he spoke to the press and this is what he had to say, "I was hungry â€¦ trying to make every play possible. No, I wasn't sick and I didn't throw up. I was tired a little bit. We scored on that drive and that's the main thing"Well that explains everything! Of course the man was hungry, all he eats is soup. I'd be hungry too. And I speak from experience, anytime I have been down and out and in the poor house, I have subsisted on basically nothing more than soup. Soup is not exactly a balanced diet. It doesn't build muscle or make you feel energized. If you live on soup you are merely living, you don't thrive on soup. When you are sick you are told to eat soup, that is because you are too ill to digest regular food. Soup is 'food light'. Soup is the true liquid lunch. McNabb's mother feeds him Campbells Chunky soup exclusively, she would like to feed the entire Eagles team soup, but I tend to believe they know better, and they probably slink off to Burger King when she's asleep. Donovan McNabb's mother Wilma considers herself the official team mother. This mother needs to have her can opener taken away.

Viva Video Poker 
My birthday is approaching. This year, I will be marking the milestone in Las Vegas. This can only mean one thing, it is once again time to work out. No, I don't mean taking up a rigorous exercise regimen, or a diet plan, it is time to drill on video poker techniques. I've long given up on simple slot machines, I don't have a good poker face, and I don't like to be rushed in my decision making, so table games are out. I have become a convert to the religion of video poker. It can be played at the bar (making the free casino drinks all the swifter in arriving), or it can be played like a slot machine (drinks are at the mercy of the cocktail waitress). The payout odds are fairly generous, and there is a smidge of strategy and a "controlling your destiny" feel to it.Each year before embarking on a casino vacation I start toying with a computer program I have, called WinPoker. I start playing round after round, sound turned up high, pc speakers and subwoofer recalling actual casino sounds, even down to cashing out my "winnings". I play and play and play and play, I order drinks, I stick a cigarette in my mouth (unlit, of course), I tip the cocktail waitress (myself) a dollar chip each time she (it's just me again) comes around, all in an effort to get an authentic experience. Does it work? I can only hope, I'm pretty broke right now, and that cocktail waitress comes around far too often.

Honk, Honk, who's there? 
In the city where I live, knocking has fallen out of fashion. Whenever people come calling in my neighborhood, they refuse to get out of their vehicles, walk up to the door, ball their hands into a light fist and rap their knuckles against wood, steel, fiberglass, hollow core, solid core, or aluminum doors. Apparently, in this drive-thru culture, the simple art of presenting one's self at a door has faded fast out of favor. The only way to broadcast your presence is by honking your horn repeatedly until your intended party arrives. Start out with several short toots of the horn to announce your arrival. The longer you are forced to wait, the longer the duration of your horn blast. Wondering what time of day or night to honk? Makes no difference, be it 3pm or 3am, honk your horn and let 'em know you're there.

Bowled Over 
Thanks to the progress of time, the Super Bowl is finally finished. I can't be the only one who is thrilled at its inevitable passage. Yes, I went to a bar to watch (can't miss out on a party atmosphere), and yes I consumed a few too many sudsy, golden hued brews. But living here in the Philadelphia area had been an arduous experience in the weeks leading up to the game. The coverage has been relentless, and even now I hear the Eagles fight song in my sleep. I am surrounded by a rush of green, as I stroll amongst heavily discounted Eagles merchandise hanging weary on store racks.Was I the sole person who didn't sell all earthy possesions for a ticket? Was I alone in staying behind in the North, cocooned in my apartment? The 'wait until next year' cries rose before the turf at Jacksonville grew cold. Wait until next year? I can.
