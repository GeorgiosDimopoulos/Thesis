1.2 IRS Procedures: Address Changes
Should I notify the IRS of my change of address?
If you moved, you need to notify the IRS of your new address. We can change our records so that any tax refunds due you or any other IRS communications will reach you in a timely manner. Refer to Tax Topic 157, Change of Address - How to Notify IRS, for additional information.
