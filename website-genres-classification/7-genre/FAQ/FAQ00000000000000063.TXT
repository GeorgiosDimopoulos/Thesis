11.1 Sale or Trade of Business, Depreciation, Rentals: Depreciation & Recapture
Can the entire acquisition cost of a computer that I purchased for my business be deducted as a business expense or do I have to use depreciation?
A deduction for depreciation of a computer for business use can be expensed in the first year if qualified, or depreciated over the recovery period. To claim the expense in the first year, the property must be used more than 50% for business use, and meet the other requirements for expensing. 
The 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 raised the aggregate cost that can be expensed for any tax year after 2002 and before 2006 to $100,000. The new law also expanded the definition of Code Section 179 property to include off-the shelf computer software. See Code Section 179 for the expanded definition. 
If you make a choice to depreciate the property you can claim a special depreciation allowance for qualified property you acquired in service after September 10, 2001 and before January 1, 2005. The allowance is a depreciation deduction equal to 30% of the property's depreciable basis. The special depreciation is figured before you calculate your regular depreciation. To qualify for the special deduction the property must: 
* Be new property this is depreciated under MACRS with a recovery period of 20 years or less. 
* Be property that was acquired after September 10, 2001 and before January 1, 2005. 
* Be property that was placed in service and before January 1, 2005. 
* Be property the original use of which began after September 10, 2001 
See Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property for additional information on the special deduction. 
The 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 modified the bonus depreciation rule by substituting a 50% special depreciation allowance for the 30%, for property acquired after May 5, 2003 and before January 1, 2005. No binding contract for acquisition can be in effect before May 6, 2003. Property eligible for the 50% additional first-year depreciation is not eligible for the 30% additional first-year depreciation. However, an election can be made to have the 30% additional first-year depreciation deduction apply to the 50% depreciation property instead of the 50% additional firs-year depreciation deduction. It is also possible to elect not to claim the additional first-year depreciation.

What kinds of property can be depreciated for tax purposes?
Only property used in a trade or business or in an income production activity can be depreciated. Additionally, the property must be something that wears out or becomes obsolete and it must have a determinable useful life substantially beyond the tax year. The kinds of property that can be depreciated include, but are not limited to, machinery, equipment, buildings, vehicles, and furniture. Depreciation is a complex topic. For more information, refer to Tax Topic 704, Depreciation, or Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property , or Publication 534 (PDF) , Depreciating Property Placed in Service Before 1987.

I purchased a computer last year to do online day trading part-time from home for additional income. Can I deduct or depreciate the cost of the computer or internet connection from my investment income?
You may deduct investment expenses (other than interest expenses) as miscellaneous itemized deductions on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), line 22, Itemized Deductions. This would include depreciation on the portion of your computer used for investment purposes, and the portion of your internet access charges used for investment purposes. 
A deduction for depreciation of a computer for business use can be expensed in the first year if qualified, or depreciated over the recovery period. To claim the expense in the first year, the property must be used more than 50% for business use, and meet the other requirements for expensing. 
The 2003 Jobs and Growth Act raised the aggregate cost that can be expensed for any tax year beginning after 2002 and before 2006 to $100,000. The new law also expanded the definition of Code Section 179 property to include off-the-shelf computer software. See Code Section 179 for the expanded definition. If the business use falls to 50% or less in a later year, these tax benefits may be subject to recapture. See Publication 946 , How to Depreciate Property for additional information on the special deduction. 
These deductions must be reduced by 2% of your adjusted gross income. Use Form 4562 (PDF), Depreciation and Amortization, to compute the depreciation for the portion of your computer used for investment purposes. 
Note: Unless the computer is used more than 50% for business purpose (as opposed to investment purposes), you cannot claim section 179 expensing of the computer or claim accelerated depreciation for it. For more information, refer to "Listed Property" in Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property.

I purchased a computer to support my job-related activities. As an employee, can I write-off the entire allowed cost or will I have to depreciate it over a few years?
You can claim a depreciation deduction for a computer that you use in your work as an employee if its use is: 
* For the convenience of your employer, and 
* Required as a condition of your employment. 
Use Form 4562 (PDF) , Depreciation and Amortization , to compute the depreciation. There have been recent changes to the percentage of depreciation claimed in the first year you place the property in service. 
The cost of a computer purchased for business use can be expensed under section 179 in the first year if qualified, or depreciated over the recovery period. To claim the expense in the first year, the property must be used more than 50% for business use, and meet the other requirements for expensing.

I need to know the maximum deduction allowed for depreciation on a passenger automobile purchased in 2003?
The maximum deduction (including any amounts deducted under section 179) that can be claimed for a used passenger automobile or one that is Liberty Zone property that was placed in service in 2003 is $3,060 for the first year, $4,900 for the second year, $2,950 for the third year, and $1,775 for the fourth and following years. For a new passenger automobile acquired on or before May 5, 2003 (and not Liberty Zone property), the first year deduction is limited to $7,660 (or $3,060 if the owner elects not to take the 30 percent additional bonus depreciation allowance.

What form and line do I deduct the 36 cents per mile on for my business travel and do I need to figure depreciation of the vehicle, too?
A Sole Proprietor's business use of a car or truck is claimed on line 10 of Form 1040, Schedule C (PDF), Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business or, if eligible, line 2 of Form 1040, Schedule C-EZ (PDF), Net Profit from Business. You may use either the actual expense method in calculating your car or truck expense or, if eligible, the 2003 standard mileage rate of 36 cents per mile. Depreciation expense is already included in this standard mileage rate. Depreciation is only calculated as a separate expense when using the actual expense method. Deductible employee business use of a car or truck may be taken on Form 2106 (PDF), Employee Business Expenses , or if, eligible, line 1 of Form 2106-EZ (PDF), Unreimbursed Employee Business Expenses. The car and truck expenses are then taken with other employee business expenses on line 20, Form 1040, Schedule A&B (PDF) Itemized Deductions .

I have a home office. Can I deduct expenses like mortgage, utilities, etc., but not deduct depreciation so that when I sell this house, the basis won't be affected?
If you have qualified business use of your home and enough gross income from that business use to that entitle you to a depreciation deduction, you are required to reduce your basis in the home by the amount of depreciation allowed (deducted) or allowable (could have been deducted). 
Whether you choose to deduct the depreciation on your current return(s) will not matter. For tax purposes, you will still be treated as if you had taken the allowable deduction, and your basis will have to be reduced. For more information, refer to Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property, Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, and Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home.

I have a rental property. Do I have to take depreciation on it?

For more information, refer to Publication 544, Sale or Other Dispositions of Assets, the Instructions for Form 4797, Sale of Business Property, and Publication 527, Residential Rental Property (including vacation homes).

The allowance is a depreciation deduction equal to 30% of the property's depreciable basis. The special depreciation is figured before you calculate your regular depreciation. To qualify for the special deduction the property must: 
* Be new property that is depreciated under MACRS with recovery period of 20 years or less. 
* Be property that was acquired after September 10, 2001 and before January 1, 2005. 
* Be property that was placed in service Before January 1, 2005.

We replaced the roof on a residential rental property and need to know what to use for the classification and recovery period to calculate depreciation?
Replacement of a roof on a residential rental property is a capital improvement to the structure. The roof is in the same class of property as the property to which it is attached. Since the property is residential rental property, the roof is generally depreciated over a residential rental property recovery period of 27.5 years using the straight line method of depreciation and a mid-month convention. You cannot write off (or take a loss on) any remaining basis in the replaced roof. For more information, refer to Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, and Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property.

On residential rental property, would new windows and siding be considered a repair that could be deducted against income, or would they be capitalized as an improvement?
Replacement of windows and siding on a residential rental property is a capital improvement to the structure, provided the replacement improves the value of this property or substantiality prolongs its life. The windows and siding, in that event, are in the same class of property as the property to which they are affixed. In this case, the windows and siding are generally depreciated over a recovery period of 27.5 years using the straight line method of depreciation and a mid-month convention. For more information, refer to Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, and Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property.

We have incurred substantial repairs to our rental property: new roof, gutters, windows, furnace, and outside paint. What are the IRS rules concerning depreciation?
Replacements of roof, rain gutters, windows, and furnace on a residential rental property are capital improvements to the structure because they materially add to the value of your property or substantially prolong its life. The items would be in the same class of property as the rental property to which to which they are attached. Since the property is residential rental property, the items are generally depreciated over 27.5 years using the straight line method of depreciation and a mid-month convention. 
Repairs, such as repainting the house, are currently deductible expenses. A repair keeps your property in good operating condition. It does not materially add to the value of your property or substantially prolong its life. Repainting your property inside or out, fixing gutters or floors, fixing leaks, plastering, and replacing broken windows are examples of repairs. If you make repairs as part of an extensive remodeling or restoration of your property, the whole job is an improvement. In that case, you should capitalize and depreciate the repair costs as the same class of property that you have restored or remodeled as discussed above. For more information, refer to Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, and Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property.

How many years do I depreciate a new furnace installed as an improvement on residential rental property and what method do I use to compute the depreciation?
Replacement of a furnace in a residential rental property is a capital improvement to the structure. The furnace is in the same class of property as the property in which it is installed. Since the property is residential rental property, the furnace is, generally, depreciated over a recovery period of 27.5 years using the straight line method of depreciation and a mid-month convention.

I purchased a snowblower and a lawn mower strictly for use at a residential apartment building I own. Can I elect the section 179 deduction to fully deduct the costs of the snowblower and lawn mower?
You cannot claim section 179 expense for property held to produce rental income (since it is use in connection with the furnishing of lodging). These assets are classified as 5-year property and must be depreciated under MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System). 
You can claim a special depreciation allowance for qualified property you acquired service after September 10, 2001 and before January 1, 2005. The allowance is a depreciation deduction equal to 30% of the property's depreciable basis. The special depreciation is figured before you calculate your regular depreciation. To qualify for the special deduction the property must: 
* Be new property that is depreciated under MACRS with a recovery period of 20 years or less. 
* Be property that was acquired after September 10, 2001 and before January 1, 2005. 
* Be property that was placed in service Before January 1, 2005. 
* Be property that the original use began after September 10, 2001.

I expensed equipment and furniture (not used for residential rental property) two years ago under section 179, but stopped doing business last year. Does any of this have to be recaptured and claimed as income, even though the items have not been sold?
If you claim a section 179 deduction for the cost of property in the year you place the property in service, and in a subsequent year, you do not use it more than 50 percent for business, you may have to recapture part of the section 179 deduction. This can occur in any year during the recovery period for the property even though the items have not been sold. Refer to Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property, on how to calculate the recapture amount. The recapture amount is computed on part IV of Form 4797 (PDF), Sale of Business Property, and is included as other income on line 6 of Form 1040, Schedule C (PDF), Profit or Loss from Business (Sole Proprietorship).

When an individual sells a building, what depreciation is being recaptured? Is it the amount of depreciation taken in the prior years or the depreciation left?
Generally, the amount of depreciation you must recapture for residential rental or nonresidential real property is the excess of the depreciation allowed or allowable over straight line depreciation for the property. Thus, if you sell a building placed in service after 1986 which required the use of the straight-line method, you would not have any depreciation to recapture. However, if you took the 30% special depreciation allowance for your building, this allowance may be subject to recapture. For property placed in service in 1986 and earlier, see Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property. For further information, refer to Publication 544, Sales or Other Disposition of Assets, and Supplement to Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property.

How do I recapture depreciation on rental property that has been sold?
If you dispose of residential rental property placed in service after 1986 (or after July 31, 1986, if the election to use MACRS was made), you would not have any depreciation to recapture because you used a straight-line method. If you do have depreciation to recapture resulting from a gain on the sale, or because you did not meet the condition above, use Form 4797 (PDF), Sale of Business Property, to compute the amount of depreciation recapture.

11.2 Sale or Trade of Business, Depreciation, Rentals: Rental Expenses v Passive Activity Losses (PALs)
I purchased a rental property last year. What closing costs can I deduct?
The only deductible closing costs are those for interest, and deductible real estate taxes. Other settlement fees and closing costs for buying the property become additions to your basis in the property. These basis adjustments include: 
* Abstract fees, 
* Charges for installing utility services, 
* Legal fees, 
* Recording fees, 
* Surveys, 
* Transfer taxes, 
* Title insurance, and 
* Any amounts the seller owes that you agree to pay, such as back taxes or interest, recording or mortgage fees, charges for improvements or repairs, and sales commissions. 
* Fees related to obtaining a loan are capital expenses and should be amortized over the life of the loan. For additional information, refer to Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, Publication 17, Your Individual Income Tax Guide, and Publication 535, Business Expenses.

I own a duplex. I live on one side and rent out the other. Are my mortgage interest and property taxes fully deductible on Schedule E?
No. Assuming that the loan is secured by the duplex, only the mortgage interest and property taxes for the portion you are renting are deductible on Form 1040, Schedule E (PDF), Supplemental Income and Loss. If you receive one bill, you should prorate the rental portion based on square footage. Your portion can be deducted on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions, if you itemize and meet the requirements for Deductible Home Mortgage Interest. For more information, refer to Publication 527, Residential Rental Property (including Vacation Homes), Instructions for Form 1040, Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss, and Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest.

Can you deduct Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) premiums on rental property? If so, which line item on Schedule E?

Where on Schedule E do you put costs paid (points, fees, etc.) to refinance a rental property?
Expenses you pay to obtain a mortgage on your rental property cannot be deducted as interest. These expenses, which include mortgage commissions, abstract fees, and recording fees, are capital expenses. You may amortize them over the life of the mortgage on line 18 of Form 1040, Schedule E (PDF), Supplemental Income and Loss.

I have losses from a passive rental real estate activity in which I actively participate. Can I offset the losses against my nonpassive income?
Generally, if your rental of real estate is a passive activity, you may offset a loss of up to $25,000 against your nonpassive income subject to certain income limitations, if you actively participate in the activity. However, married persons filing separate returns who lived together at any time during the year may not claim this offset. Married persons filing separate returns who lived apart at all times during the year are each allowed a $12,500 maximum offset for passive real estate activities. For additional information on limits on rental losses, refer to Chapter 10 of Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, and Tax Topic 425, Passive Activities - Losses and Credits, as well as Instructions for Form 1040, Schedule E, Supplemental Income and Loss.

11.3 Sale or Trade of Business, Depreciation, Rentals: Personal Use of Business Property (Condo, Timeshare, etc.)
I received income for renting out my timeshare for a week. I understand that I don't have to report income from any rental less than 15 days, but the property management company reported that income to the IRS. Do I have to report it when I file?
If you use the dwelling unit as a home (based on degree of personal use) and you rent it for fewer than 15 days during the year, do not include any of the rent in your income and do not deduct any of the rental expenses. If you do not meet the tests for using your timeshare as your home, the income is reportable on Form 1040, Schedule E (PDF), Supplemental Income and Loss. 
References:

I rent my home out for two weeks each year. Do I have to show the income on my return?
You must first consider if you use your dwelling as home. You are considered to use a home as a dwelling if you use it for personal purposes during the tax year for more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the total days it is rented to others at a fair rental price. It is possible that you will use more than one dwelling unit as a home during the year. For example, if you live in your main home for 11 months and in your vacation home for 30 days, your home is a dwelling unit and your vacation home is also a dwelling unit, unless you rent your vacation home to others at a fair rental value for more than 300 days during the year. 
There is a special rule if you use a dwelling as a home and rent it for fewer than 15 days. In this case, do not report any of the rental income and do not deduct any expenses as rental expenses. If you itemize your deduction on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions , you may be able to deduct mortgage interest, property taxes, and any casualty losses. For additional information, refer to Tax Topic 415, Renting Vacation Property/Renting to Relatives and Publication 527 , Residential Rental Property (including Rental of Vacation Homes) .

I am renting a house to my son and daughter-in-law. Can I claim rental expenses?
In general, if you receive income from the rental of a dwelling unit, such as a house, apartment, or duplex, there are certain expenses you may deduct. 
Besides knowing which expenses may be deductible, it is important to understand potential limitations on the amounts of rental expenses that may be deducted in a tax year. 
There are several types of limitations that may apply. 
* Passive Activity losses : In general, you can deduct passive activity losses only from passive activity income (a limit on loss deductions). You carry any excess loss forward to the following year or years until used, or until deducted in the year you dispose of your entire interest in the activity in a fully taxable transaction. There are several exceptions that may apply to the passive activity limitations. Refer toPublication 527 , Residential Rental Property andPublication 925 , Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules . 
* At risk rules: The at-risk rules limit your losses from most activities to your amount at risk in the activity. You treat any loss that is disallowed because of the at-risk limits as a deduction from the same activity in the next tax year. If your losses from an at-risk activity are allowed, they are subject to recapture in later years if your amount at risk is reduced below zero. Refer to Publication 925 , Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules. 
* Not for profit activities: If you do not rent your property to make a profit, you can deduct your rental expenses only up to the amount of your rental income. Any rental expenses in excess of rental income cannot be carried forward to the next year. Refer to Publication 527 , Residential Rental Property and Publication 535 , Business Expenses . 
* Rental of a dwelling unit: The tax treatment of rental income and expenses for a dwelling unit that you also use for personal purposes (renting to a relative may be considered personal use even if they are paying you rent) depends on whether you use it as a home. Refer to Publication 527 , Residential Rental Property . 
* Expenses in connection with rental of a dwelling unit for less than 15 days per year . Refer to Publication 527 , Residential Rental Property .

11.4 Sale or Trade of Business, Depreciation, Rentals: Sales, Trades, Exchanges
What form(s) do we need to fill out to report the sale of rental property?

We are selling rental property and have never claimed depreciation. What do we do about this when we file our taxes?
When reporting the sale of or computing gain or loss on rental property, you are required to make an adjustment to your basis for allowable depreciation regardless of whether the deduction was taken. For more information refer to Publication 544, Sale or Other Dispositions of Assets, and the Instructions for Form 4797, Sales of Business Property. 
If you have unclaimed depreciation for two or more years, you must use Form 3115 (PDF), Application for Change in Accounting Method, to claim the depreciation that should have been taken. The Form 3115 must be timely filed for the same tax year in which you sell the rental property or an earlier tax year. If you placed in service the rental property only one year prior to selling it, you may amend your income tax returns using Form 1040X (PDF), Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, to take deductions for the claimed depreciation.

I am selling my rental property and was asked to pay the buyer's closing costs. Is all or part of the costs deductible for me?
In computing your gain or loss on the sale, reduce your proceeds from the sale by your selling expenses, including the buyer's closing costs that you agree to pay. Refer to Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for additional information.

How do I file the gain on an installment sale of business property in each year? What form do I use?
Use Form 6252 (PDF), Installment Sale Income, to figure your installment sale income each year. This form does not account for taxable interest income from the sale that needs to be reported each year by the seller, usually on Form 1040, Schedule B (PDF), Interest and Ordinary Dividends. 
You may also need Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), Capital Gains and Losses, and Form 4797 (PDF), Sales of Business Property. For additional information including forms and instructions, refer to Publication 537, Installment Sales

I sold a rental property in which I had previous years' loss carryover due to the loss limitation rules. Can I recover the total carryover since the property has been disposed of?
The losses (but not credits) that have not been allowed from your rental property in previous years including the current year generally are allowed in full in the tax year you dispose of the entire interest in the property. 
More than one form or schedule may be required for reporting the loss. See Publication 525, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules and Publication 544 , Sales and Other Disposition of Assets for information on the reporting of the sale of activities with unallowed losses.

Can you sell rental property and reinvest it into rental property without paying capital gains tax?
No. A deferred exchange will be treated as a sale rather than a tax free exchange if the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money on other property in full consideration of the relinguished property. However, rental property may be exchanged directly for other rental property of like kind. Gain realized from such an exchange is deferred. For additional information on like-kind exchanges, refer to Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets.

I have heard that I can sell my rental property and use the proceeds to purchase rental property of equal or greater value and the transaction is viewed just like an exchange in that the tax is deferred until the new property is sold. Is this true?
What you have heard about is a like-kind exchange. A like-kind exchange, when properly executed, represents a way to postpone the recognition (taxation) of gain essentially by shifting the basis of old property to new property. If, in addition to giving up like-kind property, you pay money in a like-kind exchange, you still have no recognized gain or loss. The basis of the property received is the basis of the property given up, increased by the money paid. There are several rules and restrictions that must be strictly adhered to in order for a successful exchange to take place. Deferred exchanges will be treated as a sale rather than an exchange to the extent that the taxpayer actually or constructively receives money or other (not like kind) property in exchange for the like-kind property given up. For more information refer to .Publication 544, Sales and Other Disposition of Assets , and Form 8824 (PDF) Instructions, Like-Kind Exchanges .

We sold a rental property last year and used the 1031 Tax Deferred Exchange law to defer the gain into another like-kind property. How do I report this transaction on my tax return?
Report the exchange of like-kind property on Form 8824 (PDF), Like-Kind Exchanges. The instructions for the form explain how to report the details of the exchange. Report the exchange even though no gain or loss is recognized. 
If you have any taxable gain, resulting from the transaction, because you had a partially deferred exchange or otherwise received money or unlike property, report it on Form 4797 (PDF), Sale of Business Property, and Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), Capital Gains and Losses. Refer to Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, which has a detailed section on qualifying like-kind exchanges.

Can we move into our rental property, live there as our main home for two years, and sell it without having to pay capital gains tax?
You may be able to exclude your gain from the sale of your main home that you have also used for business or to produce rental income if you meet the ownership and use tests, detailed in Publication 523, Sale of Your Home. 
However, if you were entitled to take depreciation deductions because you used your home for business purposes or as rental property, you cannot exclude the part of your gain equal to any depreciation allowed or allowable as a deduction for periods after May 6, 1997. (Note: If you can show by adequate records or other evidence that the depreciation deduction allowed (did deduct) was less than the amount allowable (could have deducted), the amount you cannot exclude is the smaller of those two figures.) 
The gain, exclusion, and depreciation recapture should be reported on Form 1040, Schedule D (PDF), Capital Gains and Losses, as described in Publication 523, Selling Your Home.

I just sold a commercial rental property my wife and I had purchased thirty years ago (before she passed away) and I want to know how to figure my cost basis. Is it the full appraised value at the time of her death, or is it just half?
The answer depends on in which state you live in. Generally, the basis of property you inherit is its Fair Market Value (FMV) at the date of the decedent's death. If you live in a community property state (Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), and inherit your spouse's interest in a property held as community property, then the basis for the entire property becomes the FMV at the date of your spouse's death. This also assumes that at least half the value of the community property interest is included in the deceased spouse's gross estate. In other states, where the property is owned by you and your spouse as joint tenants, tenants by the entireties, or tenants-in-common, the basis of the one-half that your spouse owned would be increased to one-half of the FMV of the property at the date of death. The basis in the one-half that you owned would remain at the one-half of the pre-death adjusted basis. The new adjusted basis is, naturally, subject to all future routine basis adjustments until the property is either sold or otherwise disposed of.
