 var PUpage="76001078"; var PUprop="geocities";       "He is Duncan MacLeod, the Highlander.   Born in 1592 in the highlands of Scotland,     he is still alive.   He is immortal.   For 400 years he's been a warrior,     a lover,     a wanderer,     contantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.   The winner takes his enemy's head and with it his power.   I am a Watcher,     part of a secret society of men and women who observe     and record but never interfer.   We know the truth about immortals.   In the end, there can be only one.     May it be Duncan MacLeod."     This page is my tribute to what could be the best syndicated cult show of all time.. My opinion of course. But also of several other fans. What I have here is pictures and sounds from the series. There will be more features to come. Any contributions will be welcomed. Thank you and enjoy my page.     SOUNDS       PICTURES
