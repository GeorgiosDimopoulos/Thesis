Better Now 
So after a couple of crappy days and then a low last night I woke up feeling really good and happy and as the day went on the better I felt. I'm feeling good about myself and my life ( as after school special as that sounds). The best I've felt for awhile. Maybe it's the sun or my new attitued i've found but whatever it is I like it. I'm not even that angry at her anymore though I will continue to act how I've been acting towards her. Being assholeish is kind of fun. Those kids in cruel intentions had it right. Though i've obviousley not as manipulative as they were. And hopefully these next couple of days I will continue to feel like this but that's all for now folks.SEX, BOOZE, FUNPEACE OUT!! A-TOWN!!!

She's going down! 
O.k so I think for the most part I'm a pretty good guy. I also don't think i'm very confrontational with people either even with those I don't like I kind of sit back and try to stay away from them. BUT ALL THAT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE!! Sometimes when i think i've been wronged I can get a bit "mean" and this is one of those times. Starting tommorow I will be sly, coniving and cold towards her. I will not be walked on all over by her anymore. This may be childish, stupid and cattyish of me but I really dont' care anymore.

I can forgive her 
Thats right the whole Lindsey Lohan thing is supposedly untrue. I was worried you know her making out with 50 year Bruce Willis old but since it's supposedly nottrue (part of me didn't believe it anyway). I can go back to loving her. JK JK.

OC Thursdays! 
Tonight is another all New OC and I have to work so I guess I'll be taping it. Anyway The last few days have been pretty uneventful with not alot going on but working and random hanging outs. This weekend though Me, Shminds and Tara will head down too the end of the eternal road, a very cool road me and shminds found on Monday night but Did not go to the end because I chickened out and wanted to wait till another night. It was a very creepy place to say the least what with the white ghost dogs, the dissapearing SUV and the tractor graveyard. I'm serious people it was all real!! or was it?? hmmm.What has happened to my Lindsay Lohan, why is she spinning out of control and making out with men who are 50. Gosh make out with someone your own age!!

You had me at Hello 
So the weekend comes to an end. It was a pretty good weekend all in all. On friday Lindsey and Tara came over and we booked the hotel for calgary then we met up with hayley and robyn and headed downtown Vancouver for a random night of fun. Two stupid geek heads made fun of me cause i was hanging out with a bunch of girls. It's too bad I was cooler then them. After Our downtown trip we headed out to Riverview and drove around and got freaked out. It was fun. Saturday I worked and then went to my little cousins brithday which was packed full of annoying little kids after the party I headed out with Linds and went to her friend Briannas to watch Jerry Maguire cause I had never seen it. I enjoyed it and i also enjoyed Linds yelling "baby" everytime the cute little boy came on. And today i went to work and then came home and just relaxed. I also would like to say that certain people deserve each other. Certain Shallow, Self Centered, egotistical people really do deserve one another.Quote of the weekend:"I don't want to fall to pieces, I just want to shit and stare at you" - Tara singing a Avril song

Such Great Heights 
Just thought I'd use a song title for my newest blog since it's just gonna be kind of Random. So the other day I was thinking and I though how great would it be to buy a ticket for one of those hospital lotteries thing and hope that I win something ( I'd have to get my father to buy it though). I was also thinking that if I was Archie I would probably pick Veronica because even though she's kind of bitchy she knows what she wants and Betty's a bit of a flake. I also need to buy a cowboy hat, A sweater vest and a nice wrist cuff ( I know you don't like those lindsey) soon hopefully before I go to Calgary. Also I can't believe Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards are divorcing you know considering she's pregnant with his second child.Also who wants to see Fred Penner with me?? and would sharon, lois and bram please do a reunion tour ohhhh maybe lamb chops could come tooo.PEACE OUT!! 50 DAYS!!!!!!!

A sappy entry 
I'm Tired of chasing pretty, shallow girls.I saw the movie Hitch last night and A character in that movie says a line somewhat to that extent and it made me realize that completely agree with him. I've always liked those girls who may look good on the outside but on the inside there isnt really anything there and for the most part are kind of mean. The last girl I liked (well am currently getting over) really took the prize for being shallow. And well friends of mine think that I'm a shallow bastard I don't always think that's the case, of course I have my shallow moments but so does everyone else. Anyway now I think I can be less picky and let the girls personality take my heart. Sorry for getting a little sappy on you guys this time.PEACE OUT A-TOWN!!
