Honey, it's not just you. It's all Latin America!! In Costa Rica a high speed connection costs about $US 40 per month. A 56k speed connection is $US 15 per month. In Canada a high speed connection costs about $US 20 per month._________________Free esl tests english.abcingles.net in English ... www.abcingles.net en espaÃ±ol.

In Taiwan, there are two types of broadband internet connections known as ADSL and Cable modem, and I choose the latter to get access to the internet. The price of ADSL is quite close to that of Cable modem but the on-line speed of Cable modem is faster than that of ADSL, and that's the reason why I choose Cable modem. Now I have to pay $NT 888(about $US 26) per month.
