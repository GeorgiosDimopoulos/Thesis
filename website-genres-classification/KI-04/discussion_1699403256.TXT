Looking for Chef(s) for TV shows.       12/21/03 11:32 AM (209.86.128.231) 	
Edit   	Reply   	

I am new to this board so please bear with me. We are a TV/Film Production Co. based in Atlanta Ga. We are working on several ideas to pitch to Food Network and others. We have some strong ideas and at the point of filling in some blanks. We are looking for a Chef(s) that has a broad and deep knowledge of most foods. He/She has to have a TV type of personality, not necessarily "Over the Top" but entertaining to watch.. I have worked with people like Mario Batali, Alton Brown, and Marvin Woods... Please check out our web site and send us an email.. and pass this thread to friends...thankscraig waller404.246.2039http://www.GravityFilmwErks.com Post Extras:

This sounds like a great opportunity. I would like to try out for the TV show. What type of show would it be? Post Extras:

I am curious whether any of the chef2chef chefs who contacted this company ever received any follow up after the initial contact? I know I have heard nothing more, however, the request was posted just before the holidays -- a time when not much new get started, normally... http://feastivals.com The Culinary Adventures Chef June leads to France and the World.

You need to bake them a cake June and put a nice little note in with it. Something they'd like down in Georgia in January. Peach maybe? Post Extras:
