  	 "Fantastic" As a novice computer user, I find this software to be so easy...way easier than Windows Remote Access or Windows networking...You can even see the other computer on the other side & transfer files over your home router :)without any TCP/IP or any other confusing configuration...The only thing I would like to know is the upgrade policy but in terms of practicality & ease of use it beats Windows & Symantec PCAnywhere hands down

  	 "Far better than GoToMyPC" I have successfully connected to my job PC from my home Laptop Computer with Access Remote PC. This product is far way better when I had use in the past GoToMyPC. Their product shows a blurry screen. Doesn't look authentic. Access Remote PC looks just like the real thing. I thought I was sitting at my desk at work.

  	 "Very Good" This is the first remotecontrol, without any problems. I always work with PC Anywhare but that will change now.

  	 "Great product!" I tried your Beta 4.0 software and find it to be truly phenomenal. I manage a group of 20 university researchers across the country and have found your software to be the only one that permits high-speed remote access. We are able to run experiments in one part of the country and have others control our computer-based setup remotely. We will be purchasing several copies of your software for continuous use. Your RPC server is great idea, and we have used it to overcome firewall problems.

  	 "Great Product!" I recommend this product to anyone. It works well, very reliable, stable, easy to use with plenty of features, and that the $35 registration fees is minimal compared to the time and effort you save by using this prog

  	 "Awesome software!" I tried out the Free versions once, and I was hooked. I just got Remote PC Access Ultimate Edition Client for $299, which I must say is the best deal ever. You get a server from each any number of clients (Free) can connect to, and a client that can connect to any number of servers (Free). The EVAL part of the Free software is negated when using Ultimate Edition, it just becomes a one-connection product that is fully-functional and with no nag screens. First of all, the stability is excellent--connections are fast--and best of all, it works exceedingly well! Great value for your money. As a presenter, I use the Remote PC Access Server side of my Client Ultimate Edition, and install Free clients on each computer that will be watching my presentation. They can watch full-screen, unable to control due to privilege restrictions, as I do my presentation. It is a truly awesome product.

  	 " " Remote-PC-Access does all I need in order to take remote control of my unattended PC-Server in my home LAN and it does it in a very efficient way. On top of that what I also appreciate very much is the simplicity of everything (documentation, installation, execution, maintenance, pricing pakaging, payment service and ... extra care).
