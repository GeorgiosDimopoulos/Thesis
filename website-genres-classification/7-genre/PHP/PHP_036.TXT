I was born in Champaign, Illinois, where I earned a B. S., M. S., and Ph. D. from the University of Illinois, in Computer Science. I am a long time member of the University of Illinois' CERL Sound Group. I worked for three years at Apple's Advanced Technology Group, and for two years at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. I am currently working at Reactivity, Inc., makers of the Reactivity XML Firewall.
I am actually a jazz pianist in disguise, and a card-carrying member of Nossa Bossa, the International Computer Music Association and the now defunct Race Street Jazz Conspiracy and Penguin Jazz Quartet, I am married to Mary Wisnewski, Information Architect for Nortel Networks and      knitter extraordinaire. I am living with two cats, Izzy Gillespie Wisnewski-Walker and Arlie Parker Walker-Wisnewski.
I've been working on a mySQL and PHP-based system for turning my bird-watching field notes into web pages. I call it <birdWalker>. Please take a look.
My co-worker Dan and I have instituted a weekly Photography Challenge.
