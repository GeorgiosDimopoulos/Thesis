Anonymity  
I strongly suspect that many people who blog maintain two distinctsites - a public blog that is digestible byfriends/acquaintances/family, and a private blog that allows them tocater more to the vanity and banality of the human condition.
Of course, since my degree reads other than Psychology - this could bemere hyperbole and speculation (one really can never tell these days;-)

Blogging = crack  
Ok, there is some kind of bizarrely addictive and highly narcissistic element to blogging that I seem to only just now have been made aware of. Some kind of - here's my story and I don't care that I'm a mote of dust floating in sandstorm the important thing is that I'm here - self importance, that both acknowledges and refutes our reality as insignificant in the grand scheme of things.Meh.Anyhow - I called in sick this morning. Got the usual response. Now I'm going to crash some more before finding some overburdened walk in clinic (staff health services said: "there's NO way you can see a doctor today" and "YOU DON'T have a family doctor in the city?" Yeah, me and half the people in town - health care is broken - get over it.K. Back to bed. posted by Fever at 8:36 AM 1 comments

Ok...so here its, fully like 1:49 am - can't sleep AND I'm fully pining over my ex-gf. Like WTF. it's almost like I have emotions or something. I can't even really put my finger on when exactly I went from being a normal run of the mill would rather-play-x-box guy to a sensitive "can't believe I walked out on the love of my life" kind of guy. Well,..maybe love of my life is pushing it....but it damn sure could've been. posted by Fever at 1:48 AM 1 comments
