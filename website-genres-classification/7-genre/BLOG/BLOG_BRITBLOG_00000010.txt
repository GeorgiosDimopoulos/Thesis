Prescription Costs (an eye opener)  
Subsequent to my opthalmology problem last month I've just had a recurrence of the conjunctivitis in my right eye. Annoying but this time I decided I'd treat it myself with the same antibiotic drops prescribed previously.So off I went to my local pharmacist with my GMC registration document to prove my bona fides along with a private prescription. Now, as I was going to buy Ofloxacin drops, I thought this would be somewhat expensive so I was clutching a £20 note when the time came to pay.The total cost (including the pharmacists charge for dispensing) was £4.00 - somewhat less than the £6.40 I would have paid for a NHS script. What a pleasant surprise to find it 37% cheaper!The chloramphenicol drops I originally self-prescribed privately came to £2.00 in total. I need to give this some thought as, when I get back to GP'ing, this could save relevant patients quite a bit of money. The main problem will be how to get the relevant pharmacy prices for drugs that would be cheaper prescribed privately? posted by Patrat at 5:03 PM

A Dying Breed  
Over recent months the media has reported a seemingly endless stream of problems and disasters within our crumbling NHS - hospital superbugs on the increase, shortages of midwives, nurses too 'posh to wash', bed crises, new booking systems for patients that are way behind schedule, etc etc. Now I can reveal another potential crisis that is lurking just round the corner - the demise of the back-office secretarial and clerical staff. These are the people who answer phone enquiries, book appointments, type letters and reports, order supplies, update records, file results, and organise waiting lists. They are the interface between the patient and the practitioner; an often unseen and forgotten workforce but one that is vital to the running of any hospital. They are loyal and trustworthy, honest and hardworking, undervalued and underpaid, and the majority of them are rapidly approaching retirement!This dedicated group of workers belong to a generation who take great pride in their work, who put in many hours of unpaid overtime to get the job done, who have a strong sense of loyalty (often misplaced) to the Service that has employed them all or most of their working lives. Now as they reach retirement there is an increasing difficulty in attracting newcomers to the vacant posts - the younger generation have the options of much better paid jobs in far more attractive environments. My local hospital has been advertising over several months now for various secretarial and clerical posts but there is little interest and two new appointments that were made didn't last the week! Meanwhile the remaining staff are expected to absorb the additional workload and many are going off sick with stress as a result. The situation is starting to spiral out of control and if what I am seeing locally is replicated across the country, this is indeed set to become another crisis in the NHS and perhaps another nail in its coffin. posted by Tariami at 10:02 PM

Referred to Casualty (an eye opener)  
Having worked in 13 different hospitals as a House Officer/SHO/Registrar/Sen-Reg I have encountered a wide range of organisational ability evident in departments, ranging from the exceptional through to the chaotic. What I haven't had experience of is the view from the patient's side apart from 3 A&E attendances of which 2 have been for ophthalmology problems. Last Wednesday I experienced the chaotic end of the spectrum on my 4th attendance.I was having problems with an acute red eye which I thought was just conjunctivitis & I had self-prescribed some Chloramphenicol drops (cheaper on private script than NHS script). However my right eye was deteriorating despite this so I went to see my GP, I rang up & got an appointment within 90 minutes. I saw a locum GP who was knowledgeable, polite & agreed with me that I needed to be seen by an ophthalmologist that day so she suggested I attended the local Eye Department A&E unit. At that point I did wonder if I should just ring the local private hospital & arrange for a consultation but I thought better of it (so I thought).Now the access times were 9-11 & 2-4 so I had to go for the afternoon time & turned up at 2:05 to be seen. Oh dear! Firstly the department was poorly signed & I wound up in the outpatient's department (along with someone else) asking for directions. When we both arrived at our destination there was already a queue but that's to be expected. However we were all in line-astern in a corridor shuffling through to a desk in another corridor where a nurse took our details on a piece of A4 paper before being told to sit in the waiting room. I had brought my NHS card with all my details on it, but as the nurse could only write & not read I had to repeat all the details so that she could write them down.It was not a good start. So I sat down with no indication of waiting times or procedure having been given. So I waited for the next 90 minutes whilst nurses flip-flopped up & down the corridor, doctors came out & chatted with the nurses & a patient was seen every 18 minutes on average. I started to get concerned when I overheard later arrivals being told that:
Casualty is closed & you might not get seen
 
Oh well, I thought, I'll keep my head down & hopefully I'll get through. During this time I was amused to hear of notes being lost, appointments made last week not on clinic lists & various other cock-ups not uncommon to a failing bureaucracy. Occasionally a patient would disappear for a few minutes, only to reappear & sit down again with no change in clinical condition.Eventually my turn came to partake in this ritual that I later realised was triage. I was interviewed by a nurse who wrote down my symptoms on another piece of A4 but failing to ask some relevant questions on past medical & family history before I too went back to my very warm & familiar seat. 40 minutes later I was called in! Finally what I had come for - to see a doctor for diagnosis & treatment. A very courteous chap asked all the questions asked earlier on in the day by the nurse (including relevant ones missed earlier) before examining, prescribing & informing me of what was wrong & what needed to be done. The end was in (blurred) sight! The important bit took all of 10 minutesSo off I went to the pharmacy with my prescription. I was the only one there but it involved further waiting to see the pharmacist & hand over my piece of paper. The pharmacist seemed surprised that I had to pay NHS charges (presumably most don't) but accepted my money & I was free!
I remember being told in some lecture at Medical School that you either pay cash for medical services privately or pay by waiting in the NHS. If there is a next time it will be cash at the local Golden Nugget (private hospital).

On Your Marks, Get Set (wait for it...)  
So the UK government has released its preferred wording for the European Constitution referendum:
Should the United Kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the European Union?
As you can see it's not that different from the Electoral Commission's stated preference:
Should the United Kingdom approve the ‘Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe?’
However it seems that Tony Blair has kicked the issue into the political ‘long grass’ where it can hide until after the election. With the state of approval for the EU in this country he certainly will not want EU issues affecting the forthcoming election. What is surprising is that this issue is not as well hidden as our messianic leader would like. Michael Howard's announcement of the Conservative Party's manifesto pledge on immigration & asylum has shown up Blair's signing away UK powers in this area. Well done Mr Howard & more of the same please!It'll be good to get this election over (Labour win obviously) & then start the EU Constitution referendum race. All interested parties are in the starting blocks as it is. posted by Patrat at 11:01 AM

Mobile Roadblocks (a rant)  
I suppose as I'm now firmly middle-aged I am allowed the occaisional rant that makes me sound like disgusted of Tunbridge Wells - so here goes!Earlier this week we were travelling to the Wirral from the south of London & thus the route was M25-M40-M42-M6 Toll-M6-M56-M53. All was well (apart from the inevitable M25 traffic jam around the Heathrow roadworks) until we drew close to Birmingham. It then became more obvious that HGV lorries were occupying the first 2 lanes of the motorway, with the overtaking HGV making sod-all progress. This inevitably caused a tailback as cars jockeyed for position whilst cramming into the third lane to overtake this travelling mess, leading to distances between cars that could only be measured by microscope.Now I know that HGVs are speed limited to 56mph but why are they trying to overtake when the speed differential is 1mph (& that's me being generous)? What advantage are these HGV drivers gaining? Do they want to screw it up for the rest of us on the motorway? Can't they realise that their position is the first lane because of their speed & that's where they should stay?The further away from Birmingham we got, the less the problem became which says something about that city. The only saving grace was the M6-Toll; absolute bliss! A good road surface with minimal traffic enabling a decent cruising speed (80mph). Thank goodness for cheapskate proles not prepared to pay.Rant over. posted by Patrat at 11:15 AM

Supranationalism Versus Intergovernmentalism  
This article EUREALIST: The Asian tsunami the BBC and some other Idiot shows why the supranationalism of the EU fails against efficient intergovernmentalism. Britain needs to forge trading & political partnerships within the wider world, not bury itself in a dead-end European Union. posted by Patrat at 10:28 PM

Dress for a Costume Party  
There's nothing that the chattering classes (aided & abetted by the tabloid media) love more than a moral panic. posted by Patrat at 6:39 PM
