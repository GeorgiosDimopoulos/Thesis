KDB2278 Member DVD systems Right now, the best DVD/CD/MP3 player out there is the Clarion VRX925VD. You can also look at the Pioneer line and the Alpine Line.

Report this post to a moderator 12-26-2002 06:49 PM --> KDB2278 Member Clairon I have not had any problems with scan lines on my display. Scan lines only comes from how you have your system setup (what you have it connected to or that you have a weak video signal coming from the video source to the deck.) I use all stinger video and audio cables and I have not had any problems. Another way you could go is getting the Clarion VRX815 deck, this is only a cd player and get an external Clarion DVD player for about the same price these days. You know, get something like the Clarion VRX815 cd player and get the external Clarion DVS9755z DVD player. This would have been my second choice if I didn't get the VRX925VD. If you are getting scan lines just playing DVD's from the deck, you might want to get it checked out, could be something wrong with the display. That is if it brand new, over time scan lines might start to come up but that is common for liquid crystal displays.

The way i decided to hook the power up was to tap into the accessory power feeding the brain of my 935VD - that may have been a bad idea, but whatever, i did it. Anyway, when i was installing it i accidently grounded the accessory wire and blew the accessory fuse under the hood. Thats fine, i just finished wiring it up and replaced the fuse after completion. The problem is that when i turn the car on now, the deck will not go on. On the deck - in its closed position - all the buttons light up, but the front display does not go on, and it acts like it is off (the eject button works but it will not take a CD in). I was wondering if you guys have any suggestions. I would apprecaite it. Right now im nervous that i fried the brain, but i where it was grounded was between the battery and the brain, so it should not have done n e thing to it... who knows...

I've had a lot of decks, but multimedia and video decks are new to me. Can anyone recommend any decks i.e. kenwood, clairon, sony, panasonic? I'm looking for dvd,cd,mp3 in a single deck.
