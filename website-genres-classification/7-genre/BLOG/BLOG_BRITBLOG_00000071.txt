Emptiness Fills me  
Dear Diary...I saw Harry today at the quidditch pitch. We're there to train for our upcoming match next 2 weeks. It was really awkard, I guess. He seems to look quite irritated when he sees me. I understand why. I shoulnd't cry so much last year. All because of Cedric. Its really hard to forget him. It was all so sudden.But the thing is, when I am still in the memory of Cedric, I'm together with Harry. But now, when I can finally free myself the thoughts of Cedric, Harry have already left me. All because of my sobbing and sorrow over Cedric.I regret my actions and also realised how important Harry means to me. I guess that he's already with Hermione.. judging the way he looks at her when they were together. I heard loads of story about them anyway. I guess.. I should relly move on and forget about all these. It will do no use to the situation anyway.Meeting Harry makes me feel sad and empty. Today, the practice was bad. I can't seem to concentrate on my job. I was on my broom, but instead of searching for the snitch, I was staring at Harry instead. I can't afford to go on like this! Perhaps i should stay off from quidditch for awhile, or maybe just quit it. I'll bring nothing to the team. I'll write in later. Going for charms now.
