1.13 IRS Procedures: Reporting Fraud
Who should I call to report someone who is not filing tax returns?
If you believe someone is violating federal tax laws, you should contact the IRS at (800) 829-0433, the Criminal Investigation Hotline. If you prefer, you can provide your information in writing to the Criminal Investigation Branch at the service center where you file your return. Refer to your tax package for the address of your service center. Although you are not required to identify yourself, it is helpful to do so. Your identity will be kept confidential. You may also be entitled to a reward. 
If I have knowledge that a business is making cash transactions and is not reporting it, how do I notify the IRS about this?
If you have knowledge of tax fraud being committed, you can make an anonymous report toll free to (800) 829-0433, or write to the Criminal Investigation Branch at your service center. 
How can I make sure no one files under my name using my social security number?
The IRS has security measures in place to verify the accuracy of tax returns and validity of social security numbers submitted. If however, you have knowledge of tax fraud being committed, you can make an anonymous report toll free to (800) 829-0433. You can contact the Social Security Administration to verify if there is another taxpayer using your social security number. The telephone number for the Social Security Administration is (800) 772-1213.
