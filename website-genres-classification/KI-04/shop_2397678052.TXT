* Suffer from obesity 
* Have an elevated body mass

The History of Phentermine:
 Approved for the use in suppressing an appetite, Phentermine was made available in 1959. Less expensive and more effective, it's one of the leading weight loss drugs.
 
Phentermine is prescribed:
 Once a day, on an empty stomach 30-60 minutes before breakfast. (The tablet may be cut in half.)
 
Do Not Take Phentermine: 
* By exceeding the prescribed dosage 
* Late in the day because it may cause sleeplessness 
* More often or longer than prescribed 
* Do not crush or chew 
* With Xenical (Clinical studies have not researched the combination of Phentermine and Xenical.) 

Side Effects:
 As your body adjusts to the medication, it may cause dry mouth, sleeplessness, irritability, an upset stomach, or constipation for the first few days. The side effects are mild, and they usually improve with continued treatment. If these side effects persist over a prolonged period of time, discontinue use and contact your doctor.
 
Case Study For Phentermine:
 Clinical trials reported that use of Phentermine for 9 months with a 1,000-calorie-a-day diet reduced weight by 26.9 lb (12.2 kg) compared to a 10.5 lb (4.8 kg) weight loss with diet only.
