Biography:
I'm originally from Cheshire England, but now I live in the United States, and have done for the last 14 years. I was also living in the Far East for a while, primarily in Singapore, but seem to gravitate back to the US. Singapore is a great country, and I highly recommend everyone at least once in their life get to go to Asia. There are so many things to do there, and once over there, sightseeing to other exotic islands can actually be done quite inexpensivly. e.g Thailand, Bali, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Phuket, etc... 
Career:
Right now I work in finance, specializing in stock portfolios, primarily in the Private Equities world. My background used to be the television industry, but thats an early "burn-out" career - like Finance isn't! 
Hobbies:
On the Internet: Surfing, IRC and Web Chattin, and now learning the realm of HTML - Jeez it takes a long time to write code :)
 In Real-life: Rollerblading and just having plain good old Fun!!
 Favorite Colour: PINK!!! - Can you tell - LOL...I'm kidding!
