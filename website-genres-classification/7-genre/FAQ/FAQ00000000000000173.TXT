   Subject: J3) What books have been written about tropical cyclones? 
BEST NON-TECHNICAL BOOKS: 
* Hurricanes: Their Nature and Impacts on Society
 An excellent introductory text into hurricanes (and tropical cyclones in general), this book by R.A. Pielke, Jr. and R.A. Pielke, Sr. provides the basics on the physical mechanisms of hurricanes without getting into any mathematical rigor. The book also discusses hurricane policy, vulnerability and societal responses and ends with an in-depth look at Hurricane Andrew's forecast, impact and response. Roger A. Pielke, Jr. is a Sociologist at the Environmental and Societal Impacts Group at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, USA. Roger A. Pielke, Sr. is a Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University (USA). The book's 1997 edition is available through John Wiley & Sons, Chichester. 
* Meteorology Today for Scientists and Engineers
 For a concise mathematical description of hurricanes that has NO calculus and NO differential equations, then I would suggest obtaining a copy of this book by Rolland B. Stull (West Publ. Co., Minneapolis/St. Paul, 385 pp - Chapter 16 Hurricanes p289-304). This paperback book is designed to accompany C. Donald Ahrens' introductory book Meteorology Today. 
BEST TECHNICAL BOOK: 
* Global Perspectives on Tropical Cyclones
 This is the revised version of A Global View of Tropical Cyclones and is the most current, detailed book available on the subject. This book provides the state of the science as of 1994. Improvements over the previous version include a chapter on the ocean response to tropical cyclones. This paperback book is written in 1995 by G.R. Foley, H.E. Willoughby, J.L. McBride, R.L. Elsberry, I. Ginis, and L. Chen with Elsberry serving as Editor and is available from the World Meteorological Organization as Report No. TCP-38. Their address is:

     Switzerland
BEST FORECASTING MANUAL: 
* Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting
 For the tropical cyclone forecaster and also of general interest for anyone in the field and those with a non-technical interest in the field, the loose-leaf book - Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting (1993) by G.J. Holland (ed.), World Meteorological Organization, WMO/TD-No. 560, Report No. TCP-31 is a must get. Again, the address of the WMO :a

BEST HISTORICAL BOOK: 
* North Carolina's Hurricane History
* Florida's Hurricane History
 These two books are an amazing documentaries of the hurricanes which have struck the states of North Carolina and Florida from 1526 until 1996 and 1546-1995, respectively. The author Jay Barnes - Director of the North Carolina Aquarium - tells the stories of the hurricanes and their effects upon the people of the state in an easily readable style with numerous photographs. These 1998 books are available through the University of North Carolina Press. 
OTHER BOOKS AVAILABLE:
* Hurricanes, Their Nature and History
 Before Dunn and Miller's book, Ivan Ray Tannehill came out with an authoritative reference on the history, structure, climatology, historical tracks, and forecasting techniques of Atlantic hurricanes as was known by the mid-1930s. This is one of the first compilations of yearly tracks of Atlantic storms - he provides tracks of memorable tropical cyclones all the way back to the 1700s and shows all the storm tracks yearly from 1901 onward. The first edition came out in 1938 and the book went through at least nine editions (my book was published in 1956). Mr. Tannehill was engaged in hurricane forecasting for over 20 years and also lead the Division of Synoptic Reports and Forecasts of the U.S. Weather Bureau. Princeton University Press, 308 pp (in 1956 version). 
* Atlantic Hurricanes
 A classic book describing tropical cyclones primarily of the Atlantic basin, but also covering the physical understanding of tropical cyclone genesis, motion, and intensity change at the time is Atlantic Hurricanes by Gordon E. Dunn and Banner I. Miller. Written in 1960, published by the Louisiana State Press, this book gives provides good insight into the knowledge of tropical cyclones as of the late 1950s. It is interesting to observe that much of what we know was well understood at this pre- satellite era. Gordon E. Dunn was the Director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center and Banner I. Miller was a research meteorologist also at the National Hurricane Center. 
* A Global View of Tropical Cyclones
 A very thorough book dealing with the technical issues of tropical cyclones for the state of the science in the mid-1980s: A Global View of Tropical Cyclones (1987) by Elsberry, Holland, Frank, Jarrell, and Southern; University of Chicago Press, 195 pp. A revised version of this book has recently become available, see Global Perspectives on Tropical Cyclones below. 
* The Hurricane
 A very good introductory text into hurricanes (and tropical cyclones in general), this book by R.A. Pielke provides the basics on the physical mechanisms of hurricanes without getting into any mathematical rigor. This first version is just 100 pages of text with another 120 pages devoted toward all of the tracks of Atlantic hurricanes from 1871-1989. Roger A. Pielke is a professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University (USA). The book's 1990 edition is available through Routledge Publishing, New York. An updated version of this book is available in 1997 as Hurricanes: Their Nature and Impacts on Society by Pielke and Pielke. 
* Tropical Cyclones of the North Atlantic Ocean, 1871-1992
 Researchers and those who follow Atlantic hurricanes should all have a copy of the atlas: Tropical Cyclones of the North Atlantic Ocean, 1871-1992, by C.J. Neumann, B.R. Jarvinen, C.J. McAdie, J.D. Elms; Asheville, NC, (1993), Prepared by the National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, NC, in cooperation with the National Hurricane Center, Coral Gables, FL, 193 pp. (This is the previous edition of Neumann et al. 1999.)

Also sections are devoted on the development of seasonal (and longer) hurricane forecast models and their performance. This 1999 book is available through Oxford University Press, New York/Oxford, 488 pp. 
* Natural Disasters - Hurricanes

Of particular interest is the chronology of advances in the science and forecasting of hurricanes along with biographcial sketches of researchers and forecasters prominent in the field. This book is an excellent resource in answering questions on many issues in the field. This 1999 book is available through ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, California, 286 pp.
