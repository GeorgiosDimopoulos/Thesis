Russel Crowe - an Al Qaeda target! 
Apparently Al Qaeda planned to kidnap Russell Crowe! Is it just me or does anyone else wish they had succeeded?!!To me it must be one of two things: Al Qaeda were struggling for ideas on how to follow up on nine eleven, or they hoped to redeem themselves by actually doing something good for humanity!

How very original 
The quest for originality can be quite despairing. Successfully identifying something original is obviously intensely satisfying.Originality is defined as the state of being unique.It's a bit paradoxical that in today's world whilst people do like to blend in and belong there is simultaneously a longing to be different and unique. To be original. This is perhaps more visible whenever we have to exercise some creative muscle. I always struggle to find "worthy" picture targets as most things just don't seem to be different enough. Everything seems too everyday - just boring!But truth be said "dare to be different" is no more than a fancy slogan. We don't love people who are truly different do we? The people who are different stand out and probably hang out alone! When it comes to it we prefer a semblance of normality to outright unusualness.Our quest for originality probably points more to our inner need for self discovery within the creative process. It also possibly identifies a growing inability to find self contentment within what is actually a very varied and fulfilled world. The quest for originality, sad as it may sound, might be little more than an academic form of "not happy with me me me me me!"

Sal Zaki 
Here is my friend and colleague Sal Zaki whom I've worked with over 4 years. Sal is a very creative software developer who enjoys imaginative use of colours and images in every piece of software he writes.We took this picture just after returning to work after the new year bank holiday. He does know how to smile for the camera.Sal's probably going to move on to work for Accenture's GACT team in London after our team in Manchester get's dissolved, or possibly go on to start his property business. Whatever you do Sal - all ze best!

Up and about 
We are travelling to York this morning for a one night visit. We'll be staying at the Tree Tops Guest House. We intend after checking in to drive east to the coast visiting Scarborough and Whitby. Hopefully we'll have a great time and I'll have some interesting pictures to post.Last week whilst Susie's parents where here we went up to Liverpool as they had heard so much about the city. I hope they were not too disappointed.I took this picture in Liverpool - this is China Town!

Prevention of Terrorism Bill 
I still don't "geddit!"Howz the "Prevention of Terrorism Bill" going to prevent terrorism??? If the security services have sufficient information that someone posed a significant threat to the security of the nation, why do we need new legislation to deal with it? Surely there is enough provision within the current law to arrest and charge someone who is involved in or planning an act of terrorism against this country?And in the event that there isn't sufficient data available to arrest and charge an individual why would it be then acceptable to deny that individual access to a legal defense and access to those basic rights held dearly by every member of our society?The home secretary Charles Clarke is unnecessarily muddying the waters with this idea.I find it worrying that a trend is beginning where our leaders are using the current climate of fear to steadily take away basic human rights which have been defended for ages. It is true that a free country is often open to abuse, but the danger of abuse is much graver in a country where the state denies individuals their rights.
