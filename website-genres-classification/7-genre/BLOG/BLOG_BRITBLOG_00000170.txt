High...  
No not on "the drugs", those just aren't my style. I am currently high on a recent triumph of being smarter than the smart kids for a day and finally finding a prof that rewards those that take opposition to the preconcieved notions of literatures "critics" and formulate thier own damned opinions. nuff saidLow...On the lack o hair. Had to give up the lovely flow, loaf, shag, hockey hair, whatever you want to call it for a professional look...but didn't go out without a great Mullethawk, which if I say so my self was quite possibly the hottest hair ever...not!!Anxious...Interview number 2. Last years interview went somewhat smooth but had the occasional bump sneak up. This year will not be like that, cruise control is set, the hair is chopped off and proffesional looking, the face will be shaven and clean, the suits at the dry cleaners as we speak and the attitude couldn't be better. Bright it on!!High...On inspiration. It had been nearly 5 months since I had finished a song or a poem fully. Well in the last week I have written 3 songs in full (revenge has a friend (in me), Heed the warning bell for they are comming and my 80's love ballad-on the verge of a feeling). I have decided to start a band, not for making money but purely to try something new and have a good time. I already have a lyricist/ front man/ dance choreographer/ cowbell extrodinare in myself, a guitrist in Jay Gall and a drummer in my man Dylan. This still means "Tuesday's Revenge" has room for growth, apply within! immediate openings for groupies!!Low...On a love life. But these things happen, I am in a funk...a really really long funk. Just means I can relive good times had, and focus my attentions on other things such as insomniatic rambling and my new favorite hobby of blaming life's problems on jebus...oh jebus!!!High...on physical activity. Almost looking like a beach body...minus the rippling muscles, blonde hair, girls on my arms and sand in my ass crack. But really if your in a funk just start running and working out and being active and it will seriously release some sort of "suck it up princess and start looking on the Mr. Brightside of things" endorphinsLow...Grandma fell down. Grandma is now confined to a wheel chair.High...Grandma still being in high spirits and then Grandma ran over my leg when I sitting on her floor and then when I said oww she responded "whats wrong, panties ridding a little high"...this is otherwise known as the funniest thing I have ever ever ever heard. Grandma automatic 10 me negative 3Done...this rambilotic blog!!only 6 days til taste of chaos...My Chemical Romance will be blaring in my cd player for the remainder of the week...thus making them my choice for band of the weekold MCR song you should listen to again right now: Headfirst For Halos!peace

The Slip  
"So I had a Freudian slip the other day. I was talkin to my wife and went to ask her to pass the butter, but instead I said, You bitch, you ruined my life."On that note today's blog is going to be in 2 parts...first part deals with the aforementioned Freudian slips that have graced my life quite frequently as of late and the second part is going to deal with the name of "freudian slip" and things along this line. (thus if the topics bore you already you can stop reading!)well anyway lately I have been privy to quite a number of freudian slips, which have been quite insightful and funny. The slip I have decided can be a very effective tool if used right, and quite a hillarious mistake if said at the wrong time. I have decided that I am going to start purposely using freudian slips and then just passing them off as nothing, kind of like gas and then you balme it on the dog or the person next to you like it aint no thang. Best personal slip of the week while talking to a super cute customer at the gym: "well yes the gym is closing but what you could do, seeing as it is nice out and you forgot your card, is get changed out of your good clothes and leave your car here and run to my house, grab the card and come back." and well apparently she didn't know where my house was...probably had to be there seeing as I was bumbling my words and making the usual bad jokes like I do..generally being a dorky idiot, or as I like to call it "myself"...anyway thats enough about my freudian slipsthe name "freudian slip" kind of erk's me. I mean this sort of a slip had to of happened long before freud came along, but just because he was the first to think "well I should write a book about this" it is named after him. That's b.s....(the real reason this thing gets under my skin) take for example the new movie comming soon called "Wedding Crashers", I mean that has been around for years, in one of the indie films me and roddy were going to make a wedding crashed scene was going to be shot etc. and yet now vince vaughn and owen wilson are going to be synonimus with this phenomenon. It's like all those little inventions that get copyrighted when you have used the very same thing but just never thought twice about trying to sell it to someone else...baaahhhh!!anyway back to homework!!p.s. this blog has really just turned into a full out rant sesion with very little point to the writing hasn't it...fick gotta stop that and give this thing some substance!!

The Complexities and Complications of Being Vain  
VainPronunciation: 'vAnFunction: adjectiveEtymology: Middle English, from Middle French, from Latin vanus empty, vain -- more at WANE1 : having no real value : IDLE, WORTHLESS2 : marked by futility or ineffectualness : UNSUCCESSFUL, USELESS 3 archaic : FOOLISH, SILLY4 : having or showing undue or excessive pride in one's appearance or achievements : CONCEITEDBeing vain has to suck. These are the people that have to start getting ready 3 hours before they are supposed to be somewhere. They stop anytime there is a mirror to make sure the gel is still holding thier hair right or that thier make up looks good. The care what others are thinking about them at every moment...and then often act like they are better than the person they were trying to impress in the first place. I find it quite hillarious when looking at the definition of being vain that all the explanations have a negative conotation. The funniest vain people I find are those that dress cause they "don't care what the man tells them to do" or are being rebellious against something. These are the people that make fun of the stereotypical vain people for using brand name products and what not when they themselves probably took an hour to put all thier crazy goth make up on and the gel thier rebel mohawk up straight. Then speculation must begin on the people that roll out of bed and put on whatever they feel like, maybe its because its clean and doesn't smell to bad, or they cut thier hair in a certain way cause it was cheapest. I often wonder, being semi one of these people, wether truly don't care or if its just a different form of being vain. Is everyone vain??your so vain you probably think this blog is about you...I would hope its not about you though cause its just pointless Adam is bored writing with no real purpose!anyway peace out!!p.s. Happy Belated Birthday Day Linner!!!!!!

Heated  
So I originally started this blog thingy to rant and rave about love and all that. Then I progressively started explaining my eff'd up philosphies on life. Then progressively I used it to update my life and share some of my poetry/ songwriting ability (good and bad). Again it progressed, or should I say digressed, when I began just finding ways to give props to good music and my creativity levels lacked sorely. Well tonight I am going to do the title Mr. Peters' Rants and Random Thoughts proud by once again ranting like there's no tomorrow!! (beats writing this essay thats due in less than 5 hours...but really its only a six pager and I could write that in my sleep...which I just might have to if I keep teaching y'all "a lesson in prcrastination")I am a basketball coach of a high school senior boys basketball team at the age of 21. Last year I was co-head coach and this year was slated to be the number one head coach...until the school decided to give one last shot to a man that is going to be refered to as "the dew". Thus to my coach title I had to add assistant to the front, which is never good. As the season progressed my opinions seemed to have less validity until the point where the dew would have most likely refered to me as "that guy with the beard, good looks, great style, hillarious jokes and charming smile who sits on the bench (minus everything between that guy and who sits on the bench)". So being the coach I know I am I found new ways to relate to the players. I coached them one on one, helped them become better in the terrible offense set in front of them..thus rather than creating an overhaul I leraned to adapt and thus turned that around into teaching the players how to adapt. When he yelled things at the kids I took them aside and put it in terms they could understand...ie talking. Well at some points in the season the dew was a complete eff'ing moron and I kept my mouth shut because I wanted to take over the program next year and by snapping on current head coach I probably would put myself out of the running. But tonight, playoffs, could be last game for 5 of these kids, he made one final mistake that I couldn't let happen. We played hard, with my schemes I can't honestly say we would have done any better or worse but the end of the game neared. 3 of these 5 players were not playing very well most of the game. Most coaches would have subbed them off while the game was still in hand, maybe tried something different...but not the dew, no he stuck by them until there was only a minute and a half to go, team down by 18, game out of reach. He takes 4 of those same 5 guys off and benches them...syaing he is "making a statement". I don't know if y'all play sports or anything but this was thier last game ever and he was benching them for no reason, thats like your band going to the grammy's but not letting 3 of you come because as a manager "you're making a statement". So I had enough, these kids hanging thier heads wondering what they had did wrong, parents of these kids reasy to rip the dew's head off I got up and put these kids back in the game and proceeded to lay into the dew about how much of a self centered prick and terrible coach he was. Those 5 seniors finished the game, with nothing left in them but thier pride. I recieved many pats on the back and thank you's from both the players and parents, I was givven 5 huigs (creppy man hugs some may call it) from 5 players that at that one instant had lost all hope, confidence, spirit etc. because some asshole wanted to make a statement. When it is all said and done a coach is someone who helps people get better at a skill and ultiamtely trys to help shape a person for the better. the dew is not a coach, the dew is an asshole and i am not proud to say that I was part of your "coaching staff". You yelled at kids for no reason, you never listened to thier thoughts or ideas and worst of all you cared nothing for them. so I left the dew with this question as he said he only had one passion greater than b'ball and that was his kids..."the dew, what if I were coach and the kids I benched were you kids? describe to me whats going through your head as a parent and how your kids would feel?"Guys (I know a few of ya read this) keep your heads up, you are a great group of kids that i am proud to say I have coached, that I have been part of a team with you and most importantly that I have to opportunity to call you friend!!anyway if y'all read through that whole thing congrats you must be trying to procrastinate more than I am!!

The Background  
Have you ever been in a place where you know almost absolutely everyone and yet it seems like your not even there. That you are just in the background, as noticed as a piece of funiture or the picture on the wall thats only up for sentimental reason thus its stuck in the corner. This feeling is unsettling for alot of people and they don't know how to deal with it. But if you embrace the feeling you can acctually learn alot about these people around you, as well as yourself. I know for myself I like to be kind of in the middle of things at all time, not necessarily in the direct heat of the spotlight but definately stage right of it, thus being the background is not a famillar place for myself. I found last night (congrats again ginny) that I was this background and as the rye's piled up I took a hard look at those around me. Some people I had never given a chance straight on seemed not so bad, others that I used to believe were absolutely amazing looked just average...and it seemed that at the very moment I was completely and happily content being the background that it was time for me to get back on stage, the music all of a sudden could be heard, the voices intermingled back into one big blur, the faces turned my way and I was drawn back in. On a night where family and friends came together to celebrate a marriage between 2 young people I found that I was completely and genuinely happy for them and that they deserved the spotlight. So next time you feel as though your blending into the walls and that no one notices embrace it and see what happens...sometimes you need cooling off from the heat of the spotlight and sometimes you just need to get off the stage completely.well guess what another blog of pointless rambling...I need someone to cuddle up and watch movies with and keep my mind on one track otherwise this is just going to continue!!"I want to take you far from the cynics in this town...to a brand new colony where everything will change" - The Postal Service

Effortless  
It seems to me that the word effortless is most often associated with the proverbial true love. Where everything just falls into place perfectly and there is no need to work at it. But I have found that in my life the words effortless and love do not go together like that. I have found that when you put no effort in, don't try at all then the person begins to fall for you. When you finally realize that you yourself are falling and decide to put in some effort they turn the other way. Its like when someone doesn't like you that makes you try that much harder to like them and when they do you take them for granted. Anyway the point of this email is to ask a question. Is it that to find any sort of love one must continually put in no effort? or is it just that the right person has just not yet been found?back to studying!!!
