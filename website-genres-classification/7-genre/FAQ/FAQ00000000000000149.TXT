   Subject: G15) What is the peak number of tropical storms and hurricanes to affect my town? 
The figure here (created by Todd Kimberlain) shows for any particular location what the highest number of tropical storms and hurricanes is that affect the area sometime during the whole June to November hurricane season. Blue indicates a peak of just 1 storm, orange is 2 storms, brick red is 3 storms, green is 4 storms and red is 5 storms. We utilized the years 1944 to 1997 in the analysis and counted hits when a storm or hurricane was within about 100 miles (165 km). Back to Tropical Cyclones Climatology Page | Back to Main FAQ Page
