Peter's private homepage

Currently you can just find some informations about: 

* I believe that a non-military response is the best strategy for a permanent end to terror. See 
* my diploma thesis: The object-oriented modelling language Prima 
* some literature I collected for the thesis 
* and in addition some informations about PhD, the (first) celtic folk band I play in 
* and perhaps I should mention that the tuners (the other celtic folk band I play in) now have a (really nice! :-) CD called listen to the candle! 
* Marion and I now have a own Tandler's homepage 
* and here is a list of books that I read recently and that I like (but in German)
