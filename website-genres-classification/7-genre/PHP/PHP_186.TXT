Research Interests
My mathematical research is in Operator Theory/Operator Algebras. Click for abstracts of my mathematical publications. 	
Web Development
eGrade: Software to deliver tests, quizzes, and homework over the web. The eGrade software is published by John Wiley & Sons. EGrade and earlier versions of the software (Wiley Web Tests in Calculus and Wiley Web-Tests in Precalculus and College Algebra) have been used at over 25 universities and colleges nationwide. At UNL, the software powered mastery-learning assessment for over 7,400 active users last year, delivering and grading more than 100,000 student assignments. 	
Gateway Exams: The Gateway Exams are mastery-learning exams given to over 2,000 UNL students a year in calculus and precalculus. Powered by eGrade software. The department also offers on-line practice for the Gateway Exams. 	
On-Line Testing Center: The Arts & Sciences On-Line Testing Center is a focus on campus for high-stakes on-line testing. A facility of 70 computers established by a grant from the NU Foundation and the College of Arts and Sciences, the On-Line Testing Center supports self-paced mastery-learning, including the Keller Plan courses PSYC181 and POLS100. 	
Gilbert & Hatcher Applets: A suite of Java applets available on the John Wiley & Sons website to suppport Mathematics Beyond the Numbers.	 
Graphing Applets: A package of Java programs that I've developed. One of these lets you embed a "graphing-calculator-style" formula grapher in your web-pages, while another demonstrates Riemann sums with fast animation. And, of course, there's the ubiquitous server-side imagemap with flashing buttons... 	 
Analysis WebNotes: Analysis WebNotes is an on-line "hyper-textbook" for a year-long course in mathematical analysis (Math 825-826 at UNL). This large suite of pages (roughly 500 webpages) comprises complete course notes, homework assignments and solutions, and interactive discussion boards and demonstrations. You can get an overview of the project by reading the pages I wrote for the presentation I made on it at the International Conference on Technology in Collegiate Mathematics in 1996.	 
Webify: Webify is a simple, text based HTML document preparation system . Webify handles production of series of linked documents while maintaining a uniform look and feel that can be easily updated for the whole site. It has features geared to technical writers who want to insert LaTeX fragments into their documents. Webify is the tool that was used to create Analysis WebNotes. Download a free copy, with full documentation.	 
Faculty Annual Update Forms: A suite of HTML forms which are used by our faculty to update their records in the department's annual review process.	 
Mastery Workshop: Presentations from a week-long workshop on uses of the web in education. Held at UNL May 17-21, 1999 with support from the Arts & Sciences Area of Strength in Math/Science Education. 	
Calculus Homepage: This homepage serves as an archive of material related to the department's calculus sequence (Math 106-107-208). It includes listings of calculator programs (which can be downloaded), and examples of projects and exams from the course.
