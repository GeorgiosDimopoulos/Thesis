To install galeon you will need Gnome and Mozilla. The current version of Galeon has been tested with Gnome 1.4 and Mozilla 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, and 1.3a/b. Other versions most likely will not work. NOTE: The 1.2.6 rpm's work only with Mozilla 1.1, and 1.3.x requires at least Mozilla 1.3a. 

The rpm's labelled "matt" are only known to work with Matthew Hall's Mozilla RPM's. Your mileage may vary of course.
