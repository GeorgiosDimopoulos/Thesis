3.6 Itemized Deductions/Standard Deductions: 6. Real Estate (Taxes, Mortgage Interest, Points, Other Property Expenses)
I just bought a home. What can I deduct from the settlement statement?
If you bought your home, you probably paid settlement or closing costs in addition to the contract price. These costs are divided between you and the seller according to the sales contract, local custom, or understanding of the parties. If you built your home, you probably paid these costs when you bought the land or settled on your mortgage. 
The only settlement or closing costs you can deduct are home mortgage interest, points that represent interest and certain real estate taxes. You may, deduct them in the year you buy your home if you itemize your deductions. Real estate taxes are usually divided so that you and the seller each pay taxes for the part of the property tax year that each owned the home. 
You add certain other settlement or closing costs to the basis of your home. You include in your basis the settlement fees and closing costs that are for buying your home. A fee is for buying the home if you would have had to pay it even if you paid cash for the home 
There are some settlement or closing costs that you cannot deduct or add to the basis of your home. These include fees and costs that are for getting a mortgage loan. For more information refer to Publication 530, Tax Information for First Time-Homeowners, and Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.

I have a mortgage for my primary residence and a second mortgage for land that I intend to build a home on. Can the interest be deducted for the second mortgage?
Unless you have begun construction of a home on the bare land that you can occupy within 24 months, the land would be considered an investment and the interest you paid on the second mortgage would not qualify as deductible mortgage interest. However, it would constitute investment interest if you itemize your deductions. For more information, refer to Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses, and Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.

I paid my mother's mortgage and real estate taxes last year. The house is in her name. Can I deduct the mortgage interest and property tax on my tax return?
Generally, you can deduct only taxes that are imposed on you. You cannot deduct the property taxes unless you are the legal owner of the property, nor the mortgage interest unless you are legally liable for the loan. Your mother cannot deduct the mortgage interest either because she did not make the payments. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax for Individuals; and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expenses; and Tax Topic 503, Deductible Taxes.

My daughter and I own a house together. Her name is on the mortgage, but both our names are on the deed. Can we each claim half of the yearly interest and property tax on our income tax returns?
In order for both of you to claim one-half of the interest deduction, both of you must be legally liable for the loan. Since only your daughter is legally liable for the loan, only she can deduct the interest she paid. Since both of you are legal owners of the property, both of you may deduct one-half of the real estate taxes paid during the year. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax for Individuals; Publication 530, Tax Information for First Time Homeowners; Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense; and Tax Topic 503, Deductible Taxes.

Is interest on a home equity line of credit deductible as a second mortgage?
You may deduct Home Equity Debt Interest, as an itemized deduction, if you are legally liable to pay the interest, pay the interest in the tax year, secure the debt with your home, and do not exceed your Home Equity Debt Limit. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest; and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

I refinanced my home last year and paid points. Are they all deductible this year?
Generally points paid to refinance your home are not deductible in their entirety in the year paid. They are "amortized" or deducted over the life of the loan. For more information, refer to Publication 936 , Home Mortgage Interest Deduction, and Tax Topic 504, Home Mortgage Points.

Is the interest paid on the loan for a lot (with no home on it) deductible as mortgage interest?
Generally, the interest paid on the loan incurred for purchasing a lot is not deductible as mortgage interest. 
If you are planning to build a house, you can start deducting mortgage interest once construction begins. The following is from Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction: 
You can treat a home under construction as a qualified home for a period of up to 24 months, but only if it becomes your qualified home at the time it is ready for occupancy. The 24-month period can start any time on or after the day construction begins. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

We purchased land to build a home on. Is the interest on the mortgage secured by the land deductible?
Interest on the mortgage secured by bare land is not, generally, deductible as mortgage interest. In order for interest to be deductible as home mortgage interest, the loan must be secured by a qualified residence. A qualified residence is your principal residence or one other residence selected by you that you use as a residence. 
Once you start construction of your home, you may treat the home under construction as a qualified residence for a period of up to 24 months, but only if the home becomes a qualified residence at the time it is ready for occupancy. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

Is interest paid on a construction loan for a new home considered deductible mortgage interest?

For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

I got a loan to buy some land. Later I got another loan for the construction of the house. After the house was built I got a third loan which paid off the first two loans. Is the interest on any of these loans deductible?
All three loans may have some deductible interest. Generally, the interest paid on a financed lot is not deductible as mortgage interest. There might be a deduction for investment interest until construction of the home begins. Once construction begins, you can, deduct mortgage interest on the construction loan for up to 24 months. Once the home has been completed and occupied by you, and the two existing loans have been refinanced, you may deduct the interest from the new mortgage. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense; and Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.

I pay interest on money borrowed to purchase land. I built a home on that land, but have no mortgage. Is the interest I pay for the land deductible? Where is it deductible on the return? 
Until you started construction, the interest on the loan to purchase the lot was not deductible as mortgage interest. Once you started construction on the property, it became deductible as home mortgage interest provided that the loan was secured by the house, and all other conditions for deductibility of home mortgage interest were met. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

I took out a home equity loan to pay off personal debts. Is this interest deductible? Where do I enter this amount on my tax return?
A loan taken out for reasons other than to buy, build, or substantially improve your home, such as to pay off personal debts may qualify as home equity debt. The interest would be deducted on line 10, Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. You may not deduct interest on any amount of home equity debt that exceeds your Home Equity Debt Limit. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

If I borrow money from my 401(k) to purchase a home, is the interest I pay back to my 401(k) deductible as mortgage interest on my 1040?
The interest you pay on money you borrow from 401(K) plan to buy a home is not deductible as mortgage interest, because the loan is not secured by the home. The mortgage must be a secured debt on a qualified home. Your mortgage is a secured debt if you put your home up as collateral to protect the interests of the lender. The term "qualified home" means your main home or second home. For details, refer to Publication 936 , Home Mortgage Interest Deduction and Tax Topic 505, Interest Expense.

May I deduct my home improvements and repairs to my home?
Home improvements add to the value of your home, prolong its useful life, or adapt it to new uses. Home improvements costs are not deductible. However, you add the cost of improvements to the basis of your property. 
Examples of improvements include putting a recreation room in your unfinished basement, adding another bathroom, or bedroom, putting up a fence, putting in new plumbing or wiring, putting on a new roof, or paving your driveway. 
For a list of some other examples of improvements, refer to Publication 523, Selling Your Home.
Repairs maintain your home in good condition. They are not currently deductible nor do they add to your home's value or prolong its life. You do not add their cost to the basis of your property. 
Some examples of repairs include repainting your house inside or outside, fixing your gutters or floors, repairing leaks or plastering and replacing broken window panes. 
Exception: The entire job is considered an improvement, however, if items that would otherwise be considered repairs are done as part of an extensive remodeling or restoration of your home. For more information, refer to Publication 523; Selling Your Home; and Publication 551, Basis of Assets.

Our home was seriously damaged by flooding last year. Are there special provisions for claiming a loss since our home is located in a declared disaster area?
Casualty losses are generally deductible only in the year the casualty occurred. However, if you have a deductible loss from a disaster in an area that is officially designated by the President of the United States as eligible for federal disaster assistance, you can choose to deduct that loss on your return for the year immediately preceding the loss year. In other words, you may treat the loss as having occurred in either the current year or the previous year, whichever provides the best tax results for you. If you have already filed your return for the preceding year the loss may be claimed by filing an amended return, Form 1040X (PDF), Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. For more information on disaster area losses (including flood losses), refer to Tax Topic 515 , Disaster Area Losses (Including Flood Losses), or Publication 547, Casualties, Disasters and Thefts (Business and Non-Business). Publication 584, Casualty, and Theft Loss Workbook, can be used to help you catalog your property.

Our garage caught fire this last July. Can we claim a loss on our income tax return?
If you lose property through casualty or theft, you may be entitled to a tax deduction. A casualty is the damage, destruction, or loss of property resulting from an identifiable event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual in nature. Some examples of casualties include car accidents, fires, and vandalism. If your property is covered by insurance, you cannot deduct a loss unless you file a timely insurance claim for reimbursement. To claim a casualty or theft loss, you must complete Form 4684 (PDF), Casualties and Thefts, and attach it to your return. Claim the amount from the form on line 19 of Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. If your loss took place in a declared disaster area, please refer to Tax Topic 515, Disaster Area Losses (Including Flood Losses). For more information, refer to Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts, or Tax Topic 507, Casualty Losses, or Publication 547, Casualties, Disasters, and Thefts (Business and Non-business). If many items are involved, also refer to Publication 584, Casualty, Disaster, and Theft Loss Workbook.

Is the mortgage interest and property tax on a second residence deductible?
The mortgage interest on a second home which you use as a residence for some portion of the taxable year, is generally deductible if the interest satisfies the same requirements for deductibility as interest on a primary residence. Real estate taxes paid on your primary and second residence are, generally, deductible. Deductible real estate taxes include any state, local, or foreign taxes on real property levied for the general public welfare. Deductible real estate taxes do not include taxes charged for local benefits and improvements that increase the value of the property. For more information, refer to Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax for Individuals; Tax Topic 503, Deductible Taxes; and Publication 530, Tax Information for First-Time Home Buyers.

I bought a 5th wheel trailer for vacationing. Can I deduct the interest on the loan for this 5th wheel? Where would it be listed? 
You can deduct the interest paid on the loan you took out to purchase the trailer as acquisition indebtedness interest only if the loan is secured by the trailer and the trailer meets the requirements of a qualified home. A qualified home includes a house, condominium, cooperative, mobile home, boat or similar property that has sleeping, cooking and toilet facilities. You can only have one principal residence and one qualified second home. Regardless of whether the trailer qualifies as a home, interest on home equity indebtedness secured by another qualified home and used to acquire the trailer may also be deductible. The interest is deducted as mortgage interest on line 11 of Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions.

What are the rules for mortgage interest on a manufactured home? Can I deduct the interest on the mortgage for the manufactured home if it is on a rented lot? Can I deduct the interest for the manufactured home and for the lot if I buy a lot for the home?
For you to take a home mortgage interest deduction, your debt must be secured by a qualified home. This means your main home or your second home. A home includes a house, condominium, cooperative, mobile home, boat, or similar property that has sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities. 
The mortgage interest on a manufactured home may be deducted if the home is on a rented lot. If you buy a lot and place a manufactured home on it, the interest paid for the lot is also qualifying home mortgage interest, provided the mortgage is secured by the house.

I refinanced my home and paid closing costs. Are the loan origination fee, appraisal fee, document prep fee, closing fee, and title insurance or any of the other expenses deductible? Are any of the fees I paid to the bank for the loan deductible?
Deductible fees are limited to home mortgage interest and certain real estate taxes. Points that represent interest on a refinancing are amortized over the life of the loan. 
Fees that are not associated with the acquisition of a loan may only have effect on the basis of the home. An example would be a transfer tax that would be charged regardless of whether a loan was involved. 
Fees related to the acquisition of a loan are not deductible and are not basis adjustments. A credit report fee is a good example. 
For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction ; Tax Topic 504, Home Mortgage Points; and Publication 551, Basis of Assets .

I refinanced my home mortgage and had to pay $2,000.00 worth of points to get the mortgage. Can I claim these points as a deduction on my tax return?
Points that represent interest paid for a refinanced mortgage have to be amortized over the life of the loan. Points charged for specific services, such as preparation costs for a mortgage note, appraisal fees, or notary fees are not interest and cannot be deducted. It is possible to deduct a larger percentage of the points in the first year if a portion of the mortgage proceeds is used to improve the home and sufficient cash is added to the transaction to be equal to or greater than the amount of the points. Certain other restrictions apply. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; and Tax Topic 504, Home Mortgage Points.

If I must deduct points over the life of my mortgage, and I have a 30 year mortgage, does this mean that I divide the points paid by 30 and enter that amount on Schedule A?
You need to divide the points by the number of payments over the term of the loan and deduct points for a year according to the number of payments made in the year. If the loan ends prematurely, due to payoff or refinance, for example, then the remaining points are deducted in that year. Points not included in Form 1098 (PDF) (usually not included on a refinance) should be entered on line 12 of Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; and Tax Topic 504, Home Mortgage Points.

I refinanced my home once and paid $1,230 in points. On Schedule A, line 12 (points not reported on Form 1098) I have listed $41 each year. I refinanced my home again and paid off the entire previous loan. Am I entitled to include the $984 (remaining points paid off) on Schedule A this year?
If you spread your deduction of the points over the life of the mortgage, you can deduct any remaining balance of the points in the year the mortgage ends. A mortgage may end early due to a prepayment, refinancing, foreclosure, or similar event. 
Under the conditions described in the question, the $984 would be deductible in the year the mortgage ended. You would report the deduction on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. For more information, refer to Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction; and Tax Topic 504, Home Mortgage Points.
