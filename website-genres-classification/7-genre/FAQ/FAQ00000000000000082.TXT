12.5 Small Business/Self-Employed/Other Business : Form SS&#8211;4 & Employer Identification Number (EIN)
Is an employer ID number the same as a tax ID number?
Yes, an employer identification number, or EIN, is also known as a taxpayer identification number, or TIN. A sole proprietorship that has no employees and files no excise or pension tax returns is the only business that does not need an employer identification number. In this instance, the sole proprietor uses his or her social security number as the taxpayer identification number.

As a sole proprietor, do I need an employer identification number (EIN)?
As a sole proprietor, you would need to obtain an identification number if either of the following apply: (1) you pay wages to one or more employees, or (2) you file pension or excise tax returns. If these conditions do not apply, your social security number is your taxpayer identification number.

Is an employer identification number (EIN) required if the husband and wife are the only persons working in the business?
If both of you carry on a business together and share in the profits and losses, you are a partnership and each would receive a Form 1065, Schedule K-1 (PDF) that is important for determining your self-employment income. If you work for your spouse, you should receive a Form W-2, showing taxes withheld and the owner spouse would claim the wages paid to you as a deduction. Both a partnership and a sole proprietor with an employee must have an EIN.
