LIGHT BLOGGING AND SLOW LOADING
My sister is visiting from Paris this week so we'll be out and about, hither and thither, in and out. So the blogging must take a back seat. Down Blog, down. 
Btw, is anyone else finding that my blog loads very very slooowly? My friend Cass tells me that I'm the slowest load of all the many blogs he visits. Are you all being too polite to tell me? It loads fast for me on IE 5 and also on Opera, and I have broadband. So I have no way of knowing what other people see or don't see. Please speak up if you have problems. Any problems.

ARE YOU SEARCHING FOR NIGRITUDE ULTRAMARINE? (July 7: the contest is over. I didn't win the i-pod or flat-screen monitor).

Interviews with God ? Yesss! It is moi!

AUGUSTINE INTERVIEWS GOD: PART SEVEN 
June 2, 2004
ARE WE BEING STALKED?
Of course we are. The internet is stalkers' paradise and every bit of information, from the size of our member to the size of our bank balance is being avidly collected by someone somewhere for who knows what sinister or commercial or trivial or crazy purpose.
 
I'm fully aware of this so I shouldn't have been gob-smacked when, innocently clicking on a link* found via Google (searching for "blocked referrer") I was instantly confronted with a page headed: COLLECTED DATA ABOUT YOU, followed by, yes, data about me. Or rather about my website: my IP number, location, host, browser, my last 20 visitors on June 01 (with their IP and hosts), a list of countries who have visited me and the number of my visitors from April 20, 2003 to June 01, 2004 (35332). Actually that figure is wrong, my own stats show 119,572. But never mind the inaccuracy, feel the spying! 
*It wasn't the site's home page that opened when I first clicked on it but their page with information about my site.
 Who gave them the right to snoop my site, as well as - and this is more disturbing - posting detailed instructions telling everyone how they too can break into any website?
 
Of course I'm interested to see my stats but do I want the whole world's hackers and nutters to have the keys to my cyber home? No I do not and I left a message to that effect, asking the site's owner to explain what he's up to. It's a French website, his name is Dan and I'll report back later when/if I get an answer. Meanwhile, en garde!
UPDATE ON THE ABOVE
 I must now apologise to Dan, webmaster of the above site, for presuming that his methods were in any way dishonourable. He has written to me courteously and in great detail, explaining technical points about the way his site works. We have exchanged messages in our native language (French) but my techie knowledge is limited and I still find some aspects of this data-gathering disturbing. Judge for yourselves by visiting his site. For the sake of fairness, here is a short extract from one of the letters I received from Dan today: 
"My site is written in PHP, that's the page where you should have landed. That means that each time someone connects to the site, the html page is generated and is UNIQUE. It's normal that you get the same information when you connect as you are unique, except for your IP which is dynamically allocated, I suppose, and your browser which you can change if you want. Each time you load or reload a page, it is completely new and somene else, being somewhere else will get a different page."
Changing the subject entirely, the next God interview is nearly ready to go to press, Another day or two should do it.
