Pasta Carbonade

Time 20 minutes

3 oz bacon, chopped
2 cloves garlic
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil a dash of dry white wine
2 eggs
2 oz freshly grated cheese (parmesan + cheddar, Gruyère or similar)
1 tbsp chopped parsley
7 oz spaghettisalt
black pepper

Instructions

1. Peel the garlic and squash the cloves a little with the flat of a knife. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry thewhole cloves until they are a deep golden brown. Throw them away.

2. Add the bacon or pancetta to the garlic-flavoured oil and cook until it starts to go crispy. Throw in the wine, let itbubble away for a couple of minutes, then turn off the heat.

3. Lightly beat the eggs in what will eventually be you serving bowl; add lots of grindings of black pepper, the parsley and grated cheese. 

4. Cook the pasta, drain it and add it to the eggy mixture. Toss it quickly and thoroughly, making sure all the strandsare coated with thickening egg and melting cheese. 

5. Add the bacon and toss again. 

6. Serve it in heated bowls (all the tossing tends to cool the spaghetti quite rapidly).
