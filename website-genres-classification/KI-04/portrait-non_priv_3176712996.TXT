The
 Young
 Writers
 Club	 
Acknowledgement	 

This club aims to encourage children of all ages to enjoy writing as a creative pastime by getting them to share their work and help each other improve their writing abilities. If you want to be a member of "THE YOUNG WRITERS CLUB" get your paper and pencils (keyboards and fingers) ready. If you like writing, we think you are going to love this club!	 

Announcements... Thanks to all those of you who have volunteered to help
 with posting submissions. I will reply as soon as I can,
 but unfortunately do not have time right now.

Sorry, but owing to a huge backlog of submissions (~1500),
 we will not be accepting any new stories or poems until these
 have all been published. Please comment on the work that does appear
 during this period and, of course, use the time to improve your own work.

best wishes, David (7th July 2003).

P.S. Those members helping to post submissions, please try to do so regularly.
