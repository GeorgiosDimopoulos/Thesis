Welcome

---------------------------------------------------------------------
               The sport of Adventure Racing is sweeping the nation at a phenomenal rate. The new challenges presented to adventure racers    have caused the sport to grow by leaps and bounds daily in popularity. Adventure Racing is one of the few sports where just    completing a race is often considered a victory. Another driving factor in Adventure racing is the emphasis that is placed    on teamwork, rather than individual achievement.         

Adventure Racing offers an easy crossover for cyclist, runners and water sport enthusiasts just to mention a few.      Adventure races can vary anywhere from 3-5 person teams to the 2 man adventure sprints. The disciplines can also vary from     race to race. Adventure racing can include shredding through tight singletrack on a mountain bike or orienteering and      hiking through a dense forest. Adventure racers may find themselves ripping down rapids in a canoe and then rappelling off     a 100 foot rock face. The races can last a few hours or several days and often cover 100 miles or more! 

The USARA membership entitles you to all of this and a whole lot more! Joining the USARA gives you a one year license     that allows you to race in any USARA Sanctioned event in the nation. USARA members will also receive Adventure World      Magazine, the quarterly adventure racing magazine. Adventure World Magazine is jam packed with exciting race news as well     as the most comprehensive listing of upcoming USARA sanctioned events in the nation. So climb on board, get your USARA     racing license, and dive into the exciting new challenges of Adventure Racing.
