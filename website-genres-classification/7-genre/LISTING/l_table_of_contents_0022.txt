This document is intended to serve as a guide to using certain bioinformatics programs. It cannot be guaranteed to be free of errors or completely up-to-date (particularly at this time -- it is an unfinished work-in-progress and many documents or headings are just reminders of things yet-to-be-done). I apologize in advance for all the dead-ends that you will encounter due to unfinished or careless work.
