UC Berkeley News (01/21/04); Yang, Sarah; Sneiderman, Phil   

Four prestigious cyber-security experts--former ACM President Barbara Simons, Avi Rubin of Johns Hopkins University, David Wagner of USC Berkeley, and David Jefferson of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory--have concluded that the U.S. Defense Department's Secure Electronic Registration and Voting Experiment (SERVE) is highly vulnerable to hackers or even terrorists who could compromise the outcome of elections without being detected. The experts are unanimous in their recommendation that the system, designed as an online absentee voting tool for 6 million U.S. citizens and servicemen living overseas, be shut down. SERVE's vulnerabilities are fundamental to the Internet, which leads to the conclusion that online electronic voting is essentially unworkable. Simons says,
