Long time - no post. Moved 25th February and been waiting for a phone line ever since, and I guess, that's what you get for living in the sticks.
Apparently BT had to string us a line since there were none available. We are going to have a merry dance when I ask for broadband!
Still, there are many advantages to living out here so I shouldn't complain and the neighbours are charming.

Why has the media gone Pete Doherty mad? And why-oh-why do they keep pronouncing his name Do-CK-erty? Is there a silent C in Doherty?
When Kate Moss fell for a famous drug addict recently, two icons of the fashion and rock worlds appeared to be set on a doomed course. A wailing arose from the media's self-appointed guardians of the 31-year-old British supermodel.Don't do it, they pleaded. "He's a hopeless junkie who was ditched by his frustrated bandmates and who, unless he gets his act together fairly soon, will no doubt be found dead in a seedy squat," Jane Moore warned in The Sun.
Ok, so he's a drug addict. Nothing new there. It's been that way for years, long before he entered the spotlight. So leave him alone, will you? Please. You're not helping!
On second thoughts... if it gets rid of Peter and Jordan or Posh and Beckham... hmmm.
Actually, I've been a big fan of Pete Doherty for years and I'm kind of gutted he's all famous now. Why do we always feel that way? Why do we get all protective when someone we've been into for years, hits the public eye? Is it because we know it will end up ruining them or what?
You can find all sorts of drug befuddled but insightful stuff at The Books of Albion. Believe me, when he goes (and I do so hope he pulls it together), the media will be on this show like a pack of stinking vultures.

Just watched Rob Roy on the TV. Never seen it before. It was depressing.
Rob Roy MacGregor was the chief of the Clan Gregor who styled themselves the 'Children of the Mist'. Some Real History
The Children of the Mist, isn't that lovely, so Lord of the Rings.
Rob called himself a Jacobite, but it might be that he was a spy for both sides during the conflicts. This enabled him to claim that any who supported the 'Revolution Settlement,' or those who supported the act of union with England were legitimate targets for his clansmen's brigandry, unless they were prepared to buy him off. A very early form of protection racket it would appear. Those who paid him off were given his word that he would protect their lands, those who did not, soon found themselves literally minus cattle etc!
He was a gangster? No! What about the honour? Damn you Hollywood. I'm depressed and disillusioned now.
I like the Scottish. I'm all up for Scottish-ness. I like Scottish oatmeal, it's very chewy. I like kilts. They're the warmest, maist sensible, way of dressing that I ken. There's a freedom aboot a kilt that troosers canna gie ye.
And I have a savage weakness for that wee Scottish breed called hobbits. Not forgetting the Nac Mac Feegle's. (Their swords glow blue in the presence of lawyers) "Ye'll tak' the high road an' I'll tak' yer wallet!"
But the thing I like most about the Scottish is Keir Hardie. He was very cool.

Ever get the feeling that the art of political posters has been lost? Clicky below.
'What a woman may be, and yet not have the Vote'
'The Right Dishonourable Double-face Asquith'
'A Suffragette's Home'
And how about a cartoon?
The thing is, I've been given this essay title and like all the best students, I'm procrastinating. Can you get paid for that?

Ah, the lure of pretty pictures. ;)

Is it wrong to want one of these?
Ok. I declare war on myself! So shoot me.
Internet nutters, please do not take the last statement seriously.

Pssst. Is it a guilty secret of mine that I quite like that Mr Livingstone?

It's about time those journalists learned to take what they dish out. Reap it!

Bought a lovely creamy chocolate eclair the other day and got a mouthful of vitriol alongside it.
The conversation started innocuously enough. The old dear behind the counter was moaning on about the cost of her dentist bills. I did feel quite sympathetic when she told me her plate had cost £600. Shocking! I thought.
Good feeling for my fellow woman quickly subsided because of the nonsense that subsequently spewed forth. I can't remember her exact words but apparently "It was all the fault of those foreigners. She didn't mind paying for herself but she seemed to be paying for ALL of them too"
Well, knock me down with a feather.
"Er, you're not foreign, are you?" says she, noting the flat look on mine and partners face.
Why? haven't you the courage of your own convictions? I thought. But, I said nothing and went silently from the shop.
I'm really quite furious. Some of the media are whipping up a frenzy over immigrants and asylum seekers and I find it immensely hypocritical when you consider their recent foray into the past and their proclaimations of 'How we must not forget the lessons of Auswitch'.
Well, Mr Media, it is a really excellent idea to blame the problems of a country on a minority. Isn't it? This is the start of dehumanisation, it is with hate propaganda that it starts. How dare you give that nice Mr Livingstone a hard time for apparent Nazi comments.
And Mr Daily Mail, I really think you ought to point out to the public exactly how many of those immigrants, (the ones you are prepared to slag down on a daily basis), you are also prepared to exploit on a daily basis in your press sweat shop! Here's a novel idea. How about paying them a decent living wage? THEN they wouldn't have to top up their wages via welfare payments. After all not only are they grafting to get your newspaper out the door and on the shelf, they're also providing you with the fodder that sells them.
It really is a travesty.
Where they offer you a featureOn stockings and suspendersNext to a call for stiffer penalties for sex offenders...If this does not reflect your view you should understandThat those who own the papers also own this land...And they'd rather you believeIn Coronation Street capersIn the war of circulation, it sells newspapers...When you wake up to the factThat your paper is toryJust remember, there are two sides to every story (Billy Bragg)
