Electronic Voting Hot List
This page contains a list of links to Internet sites with electronic-voting related information. It is intended as a resource list for those doing research on electronic voting and those interested in implementing electronic voting systems.
When I first started compiling this list I included only links related to electronic voting over public computer networks. However, I have since added links to a variety of related issues.
Let me know if you find a good link I missed. Please send suggestions for additional links to lorrie@acm.org. Sorry there are so many broken links here, I haven't had time to do a thorough update in a while.

Available Online Voting Systems
While there's been a lot of research on electronic voting systems, there isn't much software available that you can purchace or download and use to run an election immediatly. The systems described in this section may be useful to those running an election for a non-governmental organization.
* VoteAgent 
* SAVIOC Voting System 
* SZTAKI Voting and Survey System 
* Free Referenda & Elections Electronically (FREE) - open source system for conducting electronic votes 
* eVote - voting software designed to be used in conjunction with the Majordomo electronic mailing list system. As of August 1998, a shareware version was available for Majordomo running under Linux. It costs $80 to register. According to the Web site, the authors will also do custom ports to other operating systems and mailing list managers for a fee. 
* TrueBallot, Inc. Democratic Governance Systems - actually, TrueBallot does not offer online products, but they do offer electronic voting booth, vote-by-mail, and vote-by-phone products for use in non-governmental elections 
* Active Websurvey 
* See also Voting Equipment and Services Vendors 
* Other solutions for running a non-governmental election: 
* Call up your local governmental election office and see if you can borrow voting equipment from them. 
* Hire someone (perhaps a computer science student from a local college) to setup a Web-based system for your group. 
Experimental Electronic Voting System Descriptions and Software
* Secure Voting Using Disconnected, Distributed Polling Devices - by David Clausen, Daryl Puryear, and Adrian Rodriguez, Stanford University, Department of Computer Science

* Another implementation based on the Fujioka, Okamoto, and Ohta paper - by Ronald L. Rivest, Mark Herschberg, Ben Adida, and Randy Milbert. Unlike Sensus, this implementation continues to be maintained and improved. 
* Report on Electronic Voting for the Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC): Design, Implementation, and Results - unfortunately the design and implementation sections were never written, but you can get a vague idea about how the system worked from this report [used to be at http://hcs.harvard.edu/~eekim/nextleve/evote/ - link no longer available] 
* The Open Voting Consortium 
Electronic Voting Protocol Papers
See also Rachel Greenstadt's electronic voting bibliography
* Receipt-Free Homomorphic Elections and Write-in Ballots by Alessandro Acquisti. Technical Report 2004/105, International Association for Cryptologic Research, May 2, 2004, and Carnegie Mellon Institute for Software Research International, CMU-ISRI-04-116, 2004. 
* A LAN Voting Protocol by Vesna Hassler and Reinhard Posch [link no longer available] 
* An untraceable, universally verifiable voting scheme by Michael J. Radwin 
Real Internet Polls
* Costa Rica Electronic Voting Trial - CyberTimes article 
* Online voting in January 1999 Alaska Republican straw poll - Standard article 
Despite the fact that these appear to be serious efforts at gauging public opinion, at last check the sites below had few if any mechanisms in place for guaranteeing both security and privacy.
* August 1996 -- The Reform Party appears to be the first US political party to allow voters to cast their ballots via the Internet (or telephone or postal mail or in person at the convention). However, they make no promises about privacy. According to a party spokesperson, 1.13 million ballots were sent out, and 2500 people attended the convention. Ballots were returned as follows: 43,202 paper ballots (by mail or at convention), 3963 telephone ballots, 2101 Internet ballots. It's interesting to note that most of the ballots were mailed, despite the fact that voters had to supply their own postage! There were toll free numbers for telephone voting, but they were not printed in the voting instructions (they were announced at the convention, on CNN, and in press reports).

Although this is not directly related to electronic voting, this section is included because it deals with an alternative form of voting that is starting to gain acceptance for governmental elections.
