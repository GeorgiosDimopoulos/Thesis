 EXHAUST SYSTEMS
   
Need for speed offer exhaust boxes and exhaust systems from Mongoose, Magnex, Piper, Scorpion, Jetex, and Sebring. We feel that these manufacturers cover most vehicle applications and offer stainless steel or mild steel applications to provide both quality and value.
   
FULL SYSTEMS -  Mongoose, Magnex, Piper, Scorpion, Jetex, and Sebring all supply full performance exhaust systems which are listed specific to vehicle application.  Dependant upon manufacturer they are available in stainless steel or mild steel and are listed from either the cat back or from the manifold back.  Some applications are half systems and are listed accordingly.  They are available with different tail pipe options which are listed in the application.
 
 BACK BOXES - Mongoose, Magnex, Piper, Jetex, Scorpion and Sebring all list back boxes for an extensive list of vehicles.  They are available in both stainless steel and mild steel dependant upon manufacturer with various tail pipe options.  Designed to give better flow and a cooler exhaust note to enhance the vehicles look and sound.
  	 
CAT REPLACEMENT PIPES - Piper, Scorpion and Magnex offer cat replacement pipes for certain vehicle applications.  Designed to remove the restriction of the cat and allow the exhaust to breath more efficiently and increase performance. Note: This modification may invalidate warranties and road safety certificates (TuV, MOT, etc)
  
MANIFOLDS AND DOWNPIPES - Most of our supplying companies make manifolds and downpipes for the more popular vehicles.
