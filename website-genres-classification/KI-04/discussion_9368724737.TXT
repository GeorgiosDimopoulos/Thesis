hi,

i'm sorry for being not precise enough: neither the nv-driver nor the 
nvidia-driver (from nvidia.com) are working.

the driver from nvidia works fine on my workstation gpu (geforce3) but 
fails on my notebook.

i thought someone out here might be close to this issue.

i do not have the time and the ability to fix the known bugs 
(agpgart-module with centrino) in the current kernel.

thanks anyway

florian marchal

My laptop has a geforce 4 440 Go gpu and works with nvidia driver.
I'm using the stock RedHat 9 kernel.

Yep.  Mine too.

I'm not sure what you mean here.
The XFree86 server: 'nv' driver, doesn't work with mine either.
I use the 'nvidia' driver installed from www.nvidia.com.  The
README at nvidia is very good.
