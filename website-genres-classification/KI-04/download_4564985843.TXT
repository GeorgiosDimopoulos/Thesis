PostgreSQL JDBC Downloads

The current version of the drivers are available here:

* These files are provided here for convenience purposes only. If you have any problems, please try compiling from source if possible.
 
The source is included with PostgreSQL, and because it is integrated with PostgreSQL is not available on it's own. Check the main developer site for details of obtaining the PostgreSQL source code from CVS.
 

* All .jar files are compatible with all platforms. 
* Because there are several build versions for each release (6.5.x has 2, 7.0 and 7.1 have 3) check that you download the correct build for your VM (or the destination VM). 
* The pre 6.2 drivers are for historical purposes only. 
* The JDBC1 driver is intended for JDK 1.1 environments but will run under later JDKs (1.2, 1.3, and 1.4) 
* The JDBC2 driver is intended for JDK 1.2 and JDK 1.3 environments but will run under later JDKs (1.4). It will not run under JDK 1.1. 
* The JDBC3 driver is intended for JDK 1.4 environments. It will not run under JDK 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3. 
* The 7.2 source code will not build under the 1.4 JDK. You will either need the prebuilt JDBC2 driver, or build with a 1.2 or 1.3 JDK. The 7.3 source code should build fine in all environments.
