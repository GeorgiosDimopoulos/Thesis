1. Why this is here? Where to start.. theres so much of it..about 18 months ago I 'met' a woman who would turn my world upside down. She precipitated a full on mid life crisis. Partly this was due to her BPD - partly because I was at the time in life where one was about to happen anyway.It is said that in order to sort ones life out you have to empty everythi

2. Disclaimer Until last month I hadnt realised how serious BPD is. In all that follows - just incase there any sufferers reading I have attempted to ensure there are no triggers in here. I dont want to do more damage than I already may have done with one suffer. So saying, i'm only human..Also, despite what i have been through I am beginning to realis

4. The Wife As i've said - I am married. My wife is the woman who keeps me on the straight and narrow. She is my friend, my lover and counseiller all at the same time. She is the most stable self confident person i believe i will ever meet. She is my inspiration.As you will find, i have also hurt her. Through the affair with my BPD, through my insist

5. The Beginning I first met my BPD.. we will call her D, online in October 2002. Anyway eventually over the next few weeks D and i became closer. Within a few weeks she gave me her phone number and address (socially inappropriate - bells should have rung), and soon we embarked on an affair and she started to cheat on her bf. Over the next few months she began t

6. Feb/March 2003 Eventually the cracks showed with her bf and they split. Our relationship slowly changed with less and less sex and more and more friendship, occasionally just spending afternoons together. It was at this point i started to find out more about her past. In particular her string of heavy duty love affairs that within 6 months had gone sour. The a

7. Falling in love so there i was, the confidant of a bit of an odd ball. But a charming one who i had now fallen for. The little girl lost who i wanted to shelter and protect. I like to think she knew how i felt - it would have been obvious to a normal person. One night we had had a great time, she actually came up to me and hugged me - and for someone who was 'c

8. Suicide it got worse.My first day back at work i lost her profile web page so i went to google typed in her name and found.. a blog. She was counting down her days till she killed herself on her birthday - believing that she was useless, loverless and job less. She was 'fed up with being a survivor'.That night i drove to her houseÂ  - unsu

9. The very best of friends Mid way through september she started her new job. I was prepared that i may not hear from her much from now on. But she mailed me, and away we went.. it was no longer messenger it was email that we would use. In the next 10 weeks we would exchange around 900 mails!. Thats about one every half an hour of every working day!Now we were frie

10. Brother and sister During October our dialogue had focussed more and more (at her behest) on her problems. What was she doing wrong. Why couldnt she keep a man. And slowly but surely it got deeper and deeper. I had put this down to her perfectionism, her bi-polarism her black and white attitudes. We made a lot of headway.But I kept thinking to myself - ther

11. The Mother of All Christmass's We met for dinner. She told me of her friend and the problems she had had. One night he had gotten drunk because she rejected him and had a car crash. She blamed herself. He would loose his liceince. She blamed herself. So she took him in and looked after him.The dinner was difficult. It looked like she wanted to let it all out and cry at

12. Spring time Over the next few months my attitude to her changed and my anger subsided. I began to realise I had over reacted and started to mail her again ever week or so. Just little things. No reply - but - as the messages didnt bounce I know I wasnt blocked and she had recieved them. One night i also saw her on messenger. Visable - and she hadnt been lik

13. A time of discovery I was shocked. I had anticipated that she would never be strong enough to ditch me. That she would be too addicted to the attention. I was wrong.It was at this point that i started my blog. Trying to work out what had happened - work out what I was thinking and why. Self discovery of you like. Its gone well. I have realised how co dependa

14. Where next? I now believe i understand her disorder and above all i understand me.What do i want? I was going to say to help her, to be her light in the dark, to save her.. like I had in the past. But we all know that this isnt possible for a BPD. They can't be saved except by professionals, we cant be their light in the dark as that means that they

15. My Mantra 1. I will make no effort to find out about my ex friend, what she is doing or how she now is. Her life is none of my business.
2. I may have speeded up our split but in the end it was innevitable.
3. I am entitled to my feelings but the past is gone, there is no point endlessly re-living it.
4. I have a wonderful wife and a good life. Be g

16. On becoming infected with BPD traits "You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas".The longer you are with a BPD the more of their traits you pick up. This doesnt mean to say you have a disorder - but they are like a virus. Even thinking and talking about them too much can re-activate it."Wallowing in it." aka "Me, Me, Me"Alt

Back again well the people at blog tell me i have to write something or this gets deleted - which is only fair i suppose. Anyway. Life plods on with no interaction with D. If things go true to form though i am nearing the time when she may try and hoover me though. Sometime in the next month I think. We will see.

Times they are a changing Progress report: Her birthday came and went. I sent her a card and an email. I have no way of telling if either were read or just instantly consigned to both real world and e-trash can. So far then - still no contact and I am beginning to think that I may well have seen the last of her.Other news - went to see the district psychologist -

A Hoovering we shall go It being the season of neighbourlyness I decided last friday to mail herself with Christmas wishes. I had no hope of recieving a reply but thought I would try - hope springs eternal etc. Sure enough nothing came. But come the monday something odd hapened. She appeared on messenger in visable mode - something she hadnt done for over 18 months. Of

New Year New Start ..coming back to me is against all odds..It was. But it has happened. With the aid of a new years text, we are in touch again. We speak on and off online. Trivial things. We dont speak about the past.. maybe we never will. When she replied to my text I sat and cried. My nightmare has ended, the wounds are healing.But what now? I fa
