Here it is, folks, my new and improved website. Everything here is new, so please read the "Updates" section below. Don't forget to sign the guest book, and of course feel free to email me. Have fun, and come back again very soon. Oh yeah, and when you're done here check out the links for other sites, too.
 
5/31/03- I recently jumped on the online journal bandwagon. See my journal here Matt & I will also be journaling our wedding planning at this location. Stop by to check them out and see what I’ve been up to. 
10/9/02 - It's been a very long time since anything has been updated. Life is very busy right now, it's a miracle I'm having time to do this right now. Since I graduated on 5/11/02, I've been pretty busy. I got a job at Wal-Mart as a cashier, then I went from full time to part time so that I could work as an intern for State Senator Jane Clare Orie. I also recently bought a new-to-me car, a green 1997 Dodge Intrepid.
4/13/02 - Amanda has started working on some of the graphics for the site! So far,she's made a banner for the top, the links for the main menu and some small banners for links to some of my other favorite websites. 
4/5/02 - The whole site has been redone. Hopefully it's more fun than it used to be. This is what's here:
Page-O-Pretty Things
Check out my Page-O-Pretty-Things, inspired by the fact that I am, indeed, a girl. Yes boys, that's right. I've upgraded from "only a little bit female" to "girl." However, I'm still only half a person.
Llama-Rama
This page is dedicated to the llamas of the world. Ladies, read the page, and send me your llama picture.
Matt
A page about my sweetie. It needs a better title, I'm taking suggestions.
Meet Virginia
At her request, this page is about my best friend, Ginny, and our adventures together. Can we say "Bobi-Jean in a wedding dress"?
* Information about the job hunt 
* The Amy & Matt wedding website (when ever Matt decides to finish it)
