K5UBM's Ham Radio Pages 	
I have a great location for a shack, not because of the antenna but the view is great! The house is on the side of a hill and looks out over Lake Travis but the hill continues up behind the house blocking signals to the East. 	
My name is Bobby Ray Walker and I am 61 years old. I have been an ham since I was 14. I was living in Alexandria LA at that time and had to get a Conditional ticket. In later years I tested for my Advanced and Radio Telephone First at the FCC office in Dallas. I also took the Extra at HamCom in Arlington and passed the written but could not pass the 20WPM code at the time.
 	
I have several rigs and the one I use the most is an Icom 706 MKII in my RV. I use it most for APRS on 144.39 but it works all the HF bands quite well with a quad resionator antenna on the rear. I don't like changing taps or using a tuner. 	
Many of my faimly are Hams. Some are silent keys now. WB5VOM, WB5EJV. The rest still have a ticket WB5LIF, WB5WSG, WB5JFL, WB5JKR. When we got together we had our own hamvention.
