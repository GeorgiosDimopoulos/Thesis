My Background
I am from the Minneapolis area and attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. After graduating in 2001 with a degree in mathematics, I worked in actuarial consulting for a year and a half. Before returning to school in 2003, I worked briefly as a teacher of Business English in Beijing, but I returned home early when the schools closed due to the SARS outbreak. I have posted some pictures from China. I am a Twins fan. Recently, I've been spending lots of time playing tennis, bridge, and with my Nighthawk 650.
