The ACC offers 22 alpine huts, 18 regional club sections across Canada, year-round mountain adventures, support for access and environmental issues, affiliate membership in the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA), an avenue into Canadian Competition Climbing (CCC) and financial grants that support a variety of mountaineering-related projects and initiatives and much more.

The ACC has grown significantly from its early inception into a Canada-wide mountaineering club with a strong foundation of volunteers as well as professional and corporate support; and is respected among Alpine Clubs internationally.
