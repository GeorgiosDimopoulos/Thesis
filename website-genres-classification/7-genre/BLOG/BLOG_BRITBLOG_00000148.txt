outstanding  
This guy in the office who has been talking to our receptionist for about 20 minutes just noticed our candy bowl and said:"I'm gonna suck on a piece of your candy, here, if you don't mind. No sense in letting some free radicals come in and attack it."That was verbatim.And priceless.

List Lust  
About me:
* I went to an elementary school for 2 years (ages 10-12) that had only six students. I have recurring dreams involving those six people.
* I use singing along to music in my car as a method of stress relief
* I adore artichokes with melted butter, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, and my boyfriend of nearly 5 years
* I believe all women are inherently bisexual, and this is probably because...
* I went to Mount Holyoke College - all girls all the time
* I marched on Washington in April 2004 - March for Women's Lives
* I believe firmly in human rights (that covers a lot: women, lgbtq, the poor, immigrants, all that kneejerk liberal crap)
* My mom was good friends with my uncle until she met my dad
* I lived in Italy while I studied there my junior year of college
* My conversational Italian is not so hot anymore
* I have a secret attraction to tall Asian men - probably because I was a little kid when my older cousin whom I idolized was engaged to a big Korean guy named Jim who I totally fell in love with. They divorced pretty quick, unfortunately.
* I am not as purely nice as a lot of people I know and I wish I was. You know, less judgemental. That kind of thing.
* I am addicted to gmail.
* My boss freaks me out. I guess that's probably true of just about everyone, though.
* I've been topless in an olive grove. (This is part of the spicing-things-up-to-gain-readers campaign.)
That's probably enough to get you curious about me if you don't already know me. And if you do already know me, now you have some material for truth or dare games.

Torrance in the Morning  
The last thing I want to be doing in the morning is groggily staring into a computer screen trying desperately to look like I'm getting right to work. I thought when I graduated from college that I would be heading right to hub of American creativity: Los Angeles. I pictured myself as a magazine contributor, a newspaper intern, a production assistant at a struggling film company. All these dreams were beginning to take shape in July and August of 2004. I even had an internship nailed down with a small screenwriting magazine. Suddenly, the pressure hit home: I was still living at home without any money of my own and parents urging me out the door into the real world. It was time to get out, no matter where. I had to earn money, no matter how. So, aiming for LA, I instead hit Long Beach where the boyfriend lives. And instead of a groovy writing internship, I worked as a photo library clerk for the NFL for two weeks. I did the unbearable: I temped. Then I thought to myself, since I need work now but can't get into the industry of my choice immediately, I ought to work for a non-profit and be a good citizen in the meantime. That's how I ended up working in Torrance, the stripmall and car manufacturer headquarters capital of the world. Not hip and happening like LA, but dreary and very Middle America. I find myself here, at 9:30 in the morning, under a buzzing flourescent light, drinking coffee flavored with soap residue, without having time to take a leisurely shower or eat a hot breakfast, waiting for the boss to come in and tell me what to do. I know, I know, this is how most people spend their whole lives. Well, not me, buddy. I know I'll keep having to make money to pay the bills, but I swear someday I'll be doing something I like.

As promised  
I have sat down at my breakfast nook table with my mug of soup, my tasty bread, my butter, and my beer. Could life be any better? I realize it is time to do what I have come to do. I will now tell you the story of car s'mores.I am from California, but both my best friend of 10 years and I went to college in Massachusetts. After graduating from our respective institutions, with a new lease on life and no sense of direction, we hopped into a minivan we named Little Toot and journeyed across the country over the course of ten days. The phrase "this great nation of ours" was spoken frequently. As was "Ernie's hot weiner" but that's another story. Anyhow, on one long night as we drove through Nebraska through yet another summer thunderstorm, my dear best friend sought to make the s'mores that we had not been able to make while camping due to the bad weather. It was nearly midnight, we had listened to all our CDs at least once or twice, and the depths of our insanity were just beginning to be revealed. We were parked at a rest stop, watching the lightning, when my friend began her experiment in car s'mores, which by their nature, must be prepared without application of a campfire.You will all be relieved to know that this recipe was caught on tape in a brilliant and very educational demonstration.My dear friend, Alex, cut two marshmallows in half with a pair of scissors, applying the sticky sides to half a graham cracker. Goo-factor, high. She had been unknowingly warming a bar of chocolate under her ass, and although you don't know her, this is SO Alex. Handily, she transferred the semi-soft chocolate to the dusty, white surface of the marshmallows, placed another graham cracker half on top of this whole shebang, took a massive, crumbly bite, and gave a thumbs-up sign. Meanwhile, I video-taped the process and giggled like a maniacal coke fiend.Thus were born car s'mores.And thus was born my blog. May it grace your lives with some condescending bullcrap that you put in your favorites list and read every day just to see what some stranger in Long Beach is doing. Just to entice you to come back, I'll tell you that right now, I'm wearing some very sexy flannel pajama pants with artfully drawn artichokes all over them and a pink tank top which was meant for a situation much more sophisticated than this. Damn, I'm a veritable Carrie Bradshaw.

I've joined the fray  
I chose the sciency blog template because I'm such a science lover. My next post will include some reference to car s'mores and their history. Anyway, it's 5 and I'm going to leave my office, get in my snazzy Honda Civic, and go home and be a nice normal American.
