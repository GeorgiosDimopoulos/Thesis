Hi my name is Darren Furlong and this is my first effort at creating a Web page. Some of the pictures have links feel free to explore at your own discression I will try to update regulary
To start off with I would like to tell you a bit about myself. I live in a little village in Wexford called Kilmuckridge which is about 30 kilometres north of the town. I attended both primary and secondary school in Kilmuckridge. When I didnt get quite what I had hoped for in my leaving certificate I decided to do a P.L.C. cource in Enniscorthy a local town, this course could add up to 200 points onto my leaving cert so going to Waterford wasnt completely out of the question. The year came and went and I made some very good friends but unfortunately we have lost contact with each other. The Summer came and I continued to work in a local supermarket Pettitts at this stage I have been working there for the last two years. Im still there now but I am considering leaving as I am getting a little fed up with being treated like dirt. Anyway I was waiting for the results of the cource to come out but I didnt expect very much as I thought that I had failed three exams. I was at my girlfriends house when my friend Caitriona rang me asking how I had gotten on in my exams but I hadnt been. When I rang home my brother said that I had got Multimedia when he said that I went mental.
To tell you the truth I had put down Industrial Computing as my first choice but now Im glad that I didnt get it as Multimedia sounds like it could interest me moreso than Industrial. When I came to college at first I didnt know what to expect but the lecturers seemed pretty cool as are the people in my class and we are getting on really well so far.
My hobbies include aggressive rollerblading, break dancing, socialising, computers and computer games. I am currently hooked on Tekken3 hence the background. I also have an interest in emulation and roms Im going for now but keep in touch and I should hopefull develope my web page building skills. I hope to add links to some pages that interest me.
