Many of the links in this list have a rating, from one to five stars (). These ratings are chosen by the staff of The Quotations Page and are just our opinion. 

If a site has no stars, it doesn't mean it's bad - it simply means we haven't rated it yet. If a site has any stars at all, it means we think it has value - one-star sites just aren't as exciting or as useful as five-star ones. If we were going to rate a site as poor or without value, we would not include it at all.
