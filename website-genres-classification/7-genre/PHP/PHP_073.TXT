     WELCOME TO MY SITE!
If you haven't heard yet Square.net has changed to http://www.rpgame.com/  there is a link here and at the bottom of this.
For the most part this site will have just info and some downloads.  But if there are some things that you wanted to get or see that I don't have then I also have some of the best site links.
Before I start I would like to thank my good friend Chronomog for some of the pictures and for the help with Frontpage 98.  
ICQ UIN numbers: 6839395
So go and see his site some time.
To go to my site click on the Final Fantasy Anniverstity Picture down below
