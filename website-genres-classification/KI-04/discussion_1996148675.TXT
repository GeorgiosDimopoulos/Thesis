                                                        We want to have a home base in the south. We have been looking for places that have RV Homes (RV port or garage is part of house design) where we can buy a lot. Does anyone have any information about such places?

Thanks

                                                        There are several of those in Florida. The Great Outdoors RV Resort in Titusville. Mt Olive Shores in central Florida. I believe that you'll find ads in FMCA magazines for several of these types of developments. You can also try a Google search for RV housing developments and a few variations.

                                                        The Great Outdoors Resort sounds terrific, I ordered their video even though we're several years away from retiring. I like the idea of a smaller home with RV parking. The homes at Great Outdoors look really great, plus they have a whole array of options.

                                                        Thanks to all that have replied. We are in a 5th wheel, so don't get Motorhome magizine. Have heard about The Great outdoors Resort and have thier video. Not really looking to buy in Flordia. Most of the places we have seen are to lease land, not buy. We have been looking at Lake Whitney RV Resort where you buy your lot and build a RV Home. Want to find other places to look so we can make sure before we buy anything.

Thanks

Nancy, that's my take also. wouldn't dream of living in a 'community' on some tiny lot, where i don't even own the land. 

however, the idea of a RV-specific dwelling--on acreage that i own/control--Definitely!
