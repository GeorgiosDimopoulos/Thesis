SATURDAY'S STARTER FOR 10Thanks to Lamps, the start to this weekend has seen my soaring ego take a bit of a nose dive. Only 119? Piff and ptui! Perchance I'll try it again when I'm sober. // posted by simon @ 2:05 AM   postCount('111058954774556266'); | postCountTB('111058954774556266');

NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Say it ain't so. // posted by simon @ 1:02 AM   postCount('111049937773536149'); | postCountTB('111049937773536149');   PAS DEVANT LA GRENOUILLEIt has recently come to light that Froggy's nursery school playmates have been made fully cognisant of the facts that a) her mummy drinks p·linka, b) that according to her daddy, mummy's titties go, 'flip, flop, wibble, wobble' and that c) English people say, 'bollocks' a lot when they are angry.Worry not. I'll let her out at mealtimes. // posted by simon @ 12:21 AM   postCount('111049687567306255'); | postCountTB('111049687567306255');

TIMING IS EVERYTHINGWe had another 6 inches of snow overnight. This being Hungary and it not being the 'wrong kind' of snow, life is expected to go on as normal.So, I hi-hoed out to the drive, shovel in hand and cleared a path for the car out into the road. All well and good, you might think as, I must confess, did I. Wrong.Just looked out of the window. It would appear that the snow plough has just been. The road is therefore, reasonably free of accumulated flakes. My drive however, has a three foot wall of snow at its conclusion. Bollocks. // posted by simon @ 9:58 AM   postCount('110992669903915021'); | postCountTB('110992669903915021');

BORE TO DOOREnnui. Toe-curling boredom. I am in the middle of assessing oral examinations and becoming increasingly desperate. I am considering hitting the cue button, fast forwarding the lot and randomly throwing darts at the mark sheets when the doorbell rings.I am so excited that I dash outside into six inches of snow wearing only slippers, underpants and a T-shirt. I throw open the gate and just have time to register a gaping mouth, raised eyebrows and a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles before my Alsatian bitch bounds lustily twixt me and the gatepost letting out a baritone woof of triumph as she goes.The effect is satisfyingly spectacular. At first sight, she would appear to have started a jumble sale. Attempting to get off the ground in panicky little steps is a random collection of multiple layers of winter coats, scarves, fur-lined ankle boots and a fox stole.The dog escapes its orbit, heads off at some speed and whatever it is gives up its attempts at flight. The clothing allows itself to believe once more in the laws of gravitational attraction, the shock waves subside and it settles itself lumpily around what I now perceive to be a rather severe looking woman of what used to be called a certain age. Her shoulders lift almost imperceptibly as she rallies her inner troops and draws nearer. I am impressed by her powers of recovery.‚ÄúI wonder if I could interest you‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúMadam, you already have.‚Äù‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for the church, you see. People usually give‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sure they do. Giving is so much more rewarding than receiving, is it not? And may I ask just what it is that you are proposing to put my way?‚ÄùShe has the look of one who has been hit by a trout and is expecting another one along at any moment.‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not actually giving anything‚Ä¶I was rather hoping you might care‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúAh, there you‚Äôre out of luck, I‚Äôm afraid. Should you have caught me last year, my charitable spirit might have flowed from the horn of my conscience as the waters upon Shem, Ham and Japheth. Unfortunately, care is the very thing I have resolved not to do this year.‚Äù‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs just that fiscally, we find ourselves in a bit of a pickle.‚Äù‚ÄúIt would concern me not a jot were you up to your mandibles in lobster bisque. You might care to try diluting the communion wine. I understand the Austrians have a flair for that kind of thing. Now, pray excuse me, I have a flock to gather.‚ÄùShe looks momentarily as if something rather distasteful and malodorous has settled on her upper lip and promptly disappears from my horizons.And suddenly, I feel a whole lot better. I call the dog and head back inside to warm my gonads by the fire. // posted by simon @ 5:10 AM   postCount('110930467816813092'); | postCountTB('110930467816813092');

THE GAY GORDONI was at a ball on Saturday. Studiously sober, I might add. I was however, engaged in light conversation by a rather attractive, if expensively upholstered, lady at our table."You look like a gay boy with that ring on your little finger."Later in the evening she asked me if I would have a mind to steer her for a couple of circuits around the parquet."Sorry, darling. Gay boys don't dance." // posted by simon @ 11:43 PM   postCount('110928499370683524'); | postCountTB('110928499370683524');   REVERSE PSYCHOLOGYAt the same ball, a carnival themed affair for charity, several teachers from the local music school entertained the great and the good with their party turns.Idris gave us a rendition of 'Yesterday' in English but sung as if it had been written according to Hungarian phonemic conventions...kinda 'Yeshtairdoi', if you see what I mean.She then followed this up with an air of Schubert's, performed in full diva mode, complete with feather boa but, quite deliberately yet excrutiatingly, just off-pitch. Try it some time, it's harder than you think.As a result of this show-stopping performance, she was later approached by one of the local notables who enquired as to whether or not she would be interested in the post of musical director and conductor of the town choir.Hmmmmmmm. // posted by simon @ 11:39 PM   postCount('110928476257988898'); | postCountTB('110928476257988898');

POETIC LICENCE...REVOKEDYou just know you've seriously goofed when you check your mailbox first thing and find a single word message suggesting that you are an adroit practitioner of solo sex.You may glance at the empty bottle of Ardbeg and remark to yourself that you were sure it was at least half full. You may even be taken aback by the fact that your previously virgo intacta bottle of Bruichladdich has also taken a serious hit.You may think to yourself, "My god! What have I done?"But whatever you might do, do not...I repeat, NOT...attempt to retrace your steps in cyberspace. The embarrassment will be too, too acute."I didn't, did I?"I bloody well did.Oh, well. To those who fell victim to my Friday night frazzle, as recipients of either the maudlin or irrationally ranting and offensive, please help yourself to the usual ameliorations and apologies from the box in the corner. There should be one or two left.Now, pray excuse me while I dissolve. // posted by simon @ 3:22 PM   postCount('110890936964879078'); | postCountTB('110890936964879078');

FROGGY BOTTOMI am lying supine on the sofa when a shadow falls over the TV screen, obscuring my view of the rather dire Blackburn Chelsea game.Froggy, for it is she...a picture of innocence in pink pyjamas: "Daddy?""Yes, sweetheart?""This is the end for you.""What do you mean?"An evil smirk spreads across her face, she turns through 180∞, cocks up her right leg and lets one rip. A snorter.That's my girl. I wonder what the Hungarian is for skid marks. // posted by simon @ 10:49 PM   postCount('110738097094532471'); | postCountTB('110738097094532471');

BLACK ROCKor Pavlov‚Äôs BlogMaybe it‚Äôs the hidebound conservative in me but I do sometimes pine for the good old days of language teaching. Grammar translation, chalk boards and the merest squeak out of the little scroats would result in the violent insertion of the board duster into their juvenile oesophagi. The fact that these days exist solely in the fevered imaginations of the only occasionally sane is neither here nor there.I would add a few refinements of my own devising, concessions to our cruel and pitiless modern age. Random acts of even coarser brutality to keep the buggers on their toes.‚ÄúAnd what does your father do, J√°nos?‚Äù‚ÄúMy farder he work in a‚Ä¶‚Äù BLAM!! Both barrels. Point blank.‚ÄúOkay, there will now be a short test. Anyone failing to score at least 75% can stay behind after class and help scrape J√°nos off the wall.‚ÄùScoop him into the ‚ÄòFlunk Bucket‚Äô and ship him off to his next of kin.That should sort the little sods out.Have you ever seen film of teacher training or group therapy sessions? Those in which a small ball or bean bag is tossed around from person to person indicating to the irretrievably feeble minded that it is their turn to speak? Well, a slow burning fuse and a small explosive charge should certainly lively that one up a bit. I would aim for a detonation somewhere between that required to merely startle and that which would be necessary to reduce everything within a one metre radius into its constituent molecules.You could wire all their chairs up to a stack of car batteries. A set of red buttons on the teacher‚Äôs desk and one of those evil villain type levers for adjusting the intensity. Irregular verbs? Sorted. I am reminded of John Craven.‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think you know.‚ÄùBuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.A system of demerits might be in order. At the end of the course, certificates would be graded by the simple expedient of counting body parts still attached. Prosthetics will not be allowed into the examination room under any circumstances.I may even consider a complementary merit system. One gold star and you can be in charge of the bolt cutters for a day.I could never, ever work in a state school. And no, it isn‚Äôt because I have a penchant for nubile teenagers whose rowdy young buttocks are forever punching the seams of their jeans and would, therefore, have to spend most of every schoolday beating down a penile protrusion with an old copy of Newsweek, although I will admit the prospect of such debauchery is somewhat appealing. It is more that I fear I would not last longer than it took the parent teacher association to complain that their progeny were arriving home in body bags. Although why on Earth they should cavil at my eliminating the scum at the bottom of the gene pool would be quite beyond my capacity to understand.Ah, well. Ardbeg it is then. Stress relief in a glass. // posted by simon @ 1:34 AM   postCount('110704530877034254'); | postCountTB('110704530877034254');
