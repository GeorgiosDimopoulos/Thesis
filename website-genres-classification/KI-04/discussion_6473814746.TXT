I am completely new to Linux.

We have a windows network and all the desktops are windows
based. Every system has a network user id with which 
everyone logins.

Now i had installed   Redhat Linux 7.3 on one of the
newly brought server. I wanted this linux server also
be a part of our windows network. 

I had samba package also installed in the redhat box.

I have few questions .

1)  The redhat linux box has only ROOT user, can i use
   some of the windows network userid's to login
   to this linux box ?

   Or do i have to create seperate users in linux ?
   
  
2) I am trying to login to this linux box from a windows
   box using  TELNET. Now thru this telnet i am not able
  to login as ROOT user, so i had created a "TEST" user
  in linux and granted him everything in redhat box.(including root privilege). Now i can login thru telnet to this redhat box as  TEST user.   

 Can i do a remote SHUTDOWN or REBOOT of this linux box from telnet session ?

3)  In this redhat box , the default boot is TEXT mode 
    and from there if i want to go to GUI desktop i was  saying STARTX  and geting on.

In the same way can i do the thing thru some TELNET session?
Like login to the telnet (text mode) from there can i say STARTX and open up the Linux desktop in the telnet session ?

     you cannot use windows users on linux ...u have to create users for linux server.

you can login as root from your machine and shutdown or reboot the server .

Install Xmanager on your windows m/c to get the GUI of linux and login thru that

     Cathy,
1st - it is possible to use your windows users under linux. You have a few choices here. You can either use winbind or pam_smb. Here is some high level documentation on winbind ( http://ranger.dnsalias.com/mandrake/samba/Integrating%2... , http://open-projects.linuxcare.com/research-papers/winb... )

2nd - Once you have logged in with a regular user id you can su to root to do the shutdown. You could also setup sudo to allow your admin user id to do a shutdown/reboot. One suggestion is to use ssh instead of telnet. You can find a free ssh program for windowz here: http://www.puttyssh.org/

3rd - As akuindia123 stated you will need an X-Windows server running under winderz if you want to start X on your local machine.

     Thanks for the info.

One more quick question, i am trying to do this 
on the Linux server which is in windows network.

I have 2 network cards(NIC's) on the linux server
and

1st NIC ====  Internal IP address ( 10.x.x.x)
              this is talking to windows domain "ABC"

2nd NIC ===  With some IP address (192.168.x.x)
             which is directly hooked to some   
             firewall/router .

So basically i wanted to open up some ports in that firewall/router for this 192.168.x.x address, so that
the externally ( from internet or from remote place)
we can access the Linux server.

The 1st NIC is basically to talk to the windows network.

Please suggest me if anything has to be done , whether
or not this can be accomplished ?

--Thanks
 Cathy

     If you want to connect remotely using ssh to the linux machine then you could do the following.

1. Enable port forwading on the router/firewall for port 22 to the IP address of the 2nd  NIC of the linux box.

2. From a remote place use putty the connect to the external IP address of the router/firewall.

If you need help with the port forwarding then do a search on google as there is plenty of good information about it available.

Hi azrael811 ,

So i can go according to the scenario what i have
given,  2 NIC's  methodology ?

Is it ? 

And i will do the port forwarding as what you had said.

So the Linux server can have  2NIC's  with 2 different
IP addresses ? Is it ?

azrael811 (MIS)	      Dec 22, 2003	        
       
     Yes it can here is an example of how it would look

Windows|
Network | -------------|Linux|---------------------------|Firewall|

10.x.x.x         10.0.0.10    192.168.0.10      192.168.0.1    <external IP>

Also make sure you close unneeded ports on the external NIC of the linux machine.
