Welcome to my home,
stranger.

I am Serge Sushko, 30-year old russian programmer, living in Moscow. I am glad to see you here, at my home on the Internet, and I hope you will enjoy my home pages. 

If you came here accidentally - have a look on the download area with some of my projects. Maybe there you can find a program that you are looking for. 

If you are searching for information on myself or some of my projects - welcome to my resume center. 

If you are interested in martial arts - welcome to my shito-ryu pages I've collected in my www-serfing. You also probably could be interested by the ancient japan fencing tractate Go Rin No Sho (The Book of Five Rings), written in the 17-th century by famous master Miyamoto Musashi. 

If you do not know why you came here - just have fun and play online games - Tetris, Battleships and Color lines - for free. 

Anyway, I have written this text and you are reading it now. Then, let's try to get more of this - you and me, together. For comments - write me to sushko@iname.com.
