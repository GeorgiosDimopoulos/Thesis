Jon Dudas Takes Helm at Patent and Trademark    Office 

Jon Dudas became acting Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and acting Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on January 12. Dudas, who takes his post under the succession provisions of the 1999 American Inventors Protection Act, comes to the job with over a decade of experience in intellectual property law and management. 

As a private practitioner in the early 1990s, Dudas had a significant intellectual property practice that included extensive trademark and copyright work. During his six years as Counsel to the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, and Staff Director and Deputy General Counsel for the House Committee on the Judiciary--the birthplace of all federal intellectual property statutory law--he guided enactment of major patent, trademark and copyright policy, including the most sweeping revisions to American patent law since 1952, the 1999 American Inventors Protection Act, and the passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the 1998 law implementing two landmark international treaties protecting creative works in the digital age. Dudas was also instrumental in the passage of the 1996 Trademark Anti-Counterfeiting Consumer Protection Act, a law making it more difficult for seized counterfeit merchandise to re-enter the consumer marketplace.
