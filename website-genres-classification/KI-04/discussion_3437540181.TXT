 Reply 	general dry bean cooking question
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 I keep seeing that I am supposed to fill the cooker no more than half full when cooking beans becuase they swell but I am not sure whether I am supposed to fill it half full with the soaked beans and I can go over that with liquid or half full including the extra liquid.

If I can fill it 2/3 full of other foods it makes sense to me that the 1/2 full is just the beans and I can put the liquid 2" over that but I am obviously not clear on this detail.

Help!

My beans are waiting!

Thanks, 

Sunny

 The reason we only fill the cooker 1/2 way when cooking dried beans is not because they swell, but because they froth and foam and that could block the vent or valves. This applies to any foods that may foam up during cooking. To minimize foaming use 1-2 T of fat, which can be anything from cooking oil to bacon grease. So when cooking dried beans the total amount of EVERYTHING - the beans, liquid, meat and all the other ingredients must not go above 1/2 fill.

For in depth info go to the Dried Beans Sectionof the website.

 I had to divide them in half but it worked out well becuase the ham shanks I was cooking them with got cooked both times and they got very tender. Just perfect.

This was the best navy bean soup I have ever made!

Thanks,

 I cook the meat first because of the wide differences in cooking times. Check the Cooking Time Chartsif you are not using a recipe. Overcooking is probably the most common mistakes in pressure cooking. The ham cooks in 35 -45 minutes, but most any variety of bean cooks in only10 minutes. If the meat is cooked first you have all that lovely broth for flavoring the beans. yum
