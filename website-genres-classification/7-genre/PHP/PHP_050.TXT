Olav W. Bertelsen 
Lektor (associate professor), Ph.D, 
The HCI Group at the Department of Computer Science, University of Aarhus. 
I have a background in critical computer science, emphasizing use orientedness, and I also have a minor in history of ideas. Currently I am working on two issues in human-computer interaction in the tension between theory and practice. Firstly, I work on how insights from activity theory based IT-research can be transformed into methods that practitioners can apply. Specifically, I am working on an activity theory based interface inspection method. Secondly, I work on a re-orientation of human-computer interaction as an aesthetic discipline in an attempt to integrate the disciplines relevant levels of analysis. In particular, I expect that a systematic account on sensuality and sense perception in interaction, as well as an account on the specifics of cultural formations in relation to development in use can become fruitful resources for the field. Specifically, I am working on an approach to interface assessment that we call interface criticism.
