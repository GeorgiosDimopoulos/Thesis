All good things....(and some bad ones)  
Today is the day I end my blogg. I have read everybody elses bloggs and I have come to realise I cant do this shit.I cant open my heart to the world (I couldnt even do it to claire which killed that off as well) so all I end up doing is typing a load of bollocks that dosnt mean anything at all.So im going to knock it on the head here.Thanks to the people that have read my crap and thanks to those that commented (even if you were press ganged into it by Sarah lol)So this is me signing out for nowCyaAidan  posted by Aidan @ 11:19    3 comments

Im contemplating thinking about thinking  
Well Hello people.Kaycee you miss me.. aaahhh bless your cotton socks (even if it is only you being your sarcastics self) :DWell here I go as usual I will be talking total shit again as I have an eversion to talking about me so I dont do it much (dont let people in and they cant hurt you right?).I clicked on the site meter thingy at the bottom of my blog and noticed somthing really strange...Somebody had come to my site by searching on Yahoo!!!! WOW people are actually looking for me on the interwebby wotsit. My fame has spread past the state of cali and the asian guy in Goa people want to actually look for me and read my blog to here my ramblings about nothing in particular!!!So I clicked the link exitedly wanting to see what there phrase was they used.... was it Aidan Unplugged ...erm no.... was it just Aidan...erm no... was it (as usually is the case) sombody searching for Miss Marinara and inadvertantly stumbling across lil'ole me?? ... nopr not this time (makes a bloody change).So what had they looked for??? What had led them to peruse my lilttle blog about nothing ??well here it is this is what they typed in to Yahoo to get to my site... and I think they may have been dissapointed when they got to it.SEX SENCE OF PENELOPE CRUZyeah you read that rightI fell about laughing I thought it was so funny but guess where I came on the list.... 50?? 100?? 12,495??? nope... I came3rd...fookin 3rd hahahahahaaaaaso I thought I would check out a few others as this must be a fluke it can really be like this on other search engines can it??well here we goYahoo, as we know 3rdGoogle, Im bloody 2nd on GoogleAlta Vista, as with Yahoo im 3rdExite, Im 3rd again on Exite but to top it off I have to turn the adult filter off to see the results (is my blog that bad?)On Lycos I have slipped to 7th (not sure if I should be glad or dissapointed)and finally I triedAsk Jeeves...and I got.... No results for your search. Finally a search engine with a brain (ok we all know Jeeves couldnt find a prostitute in a brothel but thats beside the point).Soooo where was I going with thisI dont have a clue but hey I thought it was amusing :-)Well to the person that wanted some kinky miss Cruz pics...im sorry you didnt find what you were looking for.. I hope you didnt stay to long and moved on to somthing else :-)Well im spent so I will see you all L8rAidan  posted by Aidan @ 20:59    11 comments

New Kids On The Block  
Well waddaya know.... I go months without a post and now ya cant shut me up (sick of me yet??)I kinda knicked the idea for this short Blogg from Lizzy (yes im a lurker mwuhahahaha), well actually if you replace kinda with did it would be more accurate :)I have started to hit the "next blog" button to see what was out there and whoooaaa mama there are some total fruit loops out there so ive picked my 2 favourites to show you guys.The 1st 1 I came across was a chap called NYM who is apparently forming his own brand new Maffia Cartel and is recruiting bodyguards from blogspot, unfortunatly there seems to be no takers so far but hey its early days and who knows 1 of you may just be interested in a new vocation :)The 2nd is a lady by the name of NIKKIFISH and her blogging debut is about her life or somthing and im enjoying reading it a lot. Its still in its early stages but I think its coming on well and has the makings of a great blog so pop along, say hi and give the young lady some encoregment.Oh yeah feel free to take the piss out of NYM all you want :)told you it was short...and Lizzy im sorry for nicking your idea but i had to share those bloggs :)well it 2:15am so im off to sleepNight Night peeps  posted by Aidan @ 01:54    12 comments

I'll live when im alive and sleep when Im dead  
HelloI was on my way home from work this evening (on the bus) when I noticed an advert on the inside wall of the bus. It had a picture of a woman with a big smile on her face and then it goes on to mention that she is so relieved as she is paying off her funeral cost monthly so when the time comes she wont have to worry about the Financial side of her funeral...It got me thinking...WHAT A FUCKING WASTE OF TIME THAT IS!!!!!!!!SHE WILL BE DEAD!!!I mean how worried can you be when your dead?? Really lets think about this...Your dead why give a shit how much it costs???Take away your families finacial burden of your funeral....WHY SHOULD I??I paid for my kids to go through college and until they left home and got there own place... I clothed them, fed them, watered them was there own private cab company... and even when they have left home they still need bailing out every now and then.... so sod'em they can pay for my funeral and if I don't get 1 with all the trimmings Im coming back to haunt there asses.This then got me thinking about music at funerals which is usually a really dreary affair and I wondered what music I would have at mine.Stairway to heaven??..nah to predictable and besides they aint gonna let me inKnock on wood??... funny but doesn't have that magical touchthen it hit me....the perfect song...the funeral song to end all funeral songs!!!it has to be done I almost cant wait to die so I can do itlet me set the scene (im gettin toasted when I go)Everybody sat at the pews heads bowed crying (more because I aint left them anything)Claire at the back with a self satisfied grin on her face.The vicar doing his ashes to ashes bitThe curtain pulls open the conveyor belt slowly starts taking my casket to be tourched then over the speakers you getBURN BABY BURN DISCO INFERNOOOOOOI will so piss myself laughing sat in purgatory watching it all happen and the looks on everybody's faces...Priceless I tells yaanyway im gonna shut up now and leave you in peace...to rest there if you willlet me know what you think would be a cool tune at your funerall8terzAidan  posted by Aidan @ 00:13    11 comments
