Suitable Words.com Freelance Web Site Content Writer
=====================================================================
 
   
Welcome to my Suitable Words Web Site 	
It's a pleasure to have you stop by my online presence! My name is Cherié Davidson. I am a freelance writer, site content copywriter, editor and developer, and this is my business Web site. 
Suitable Words.com is a serious business site from an eccentric writer with a quirky sense of humor. As you flip through the tabs of my virtual notebook, you will find a list of my services and a portfolio area, which include Web site content development, copywriting, editing, e-book editing and proofreading, and various freelance writing both on and offline. 
By clicking on the notebook tabs, you will learn about who I am, what Suitable Words is all about, what I do and the services I offer. You will see my portfolio (pretty cool if I do say so myself), find out how to contact me, and learn a little bit about my pal and assistant office manager, Auggie Doggy. 
Please, flip through the pages, browse to your heart's content. I hope you will look through my portfolio and consider my services. If you want your online content to "pop," if you want your readers to come back for more, or if you want to convey your message in the best way possible, shoot me an e-mail and I'll give you a quote you'll be able to smile about. 
Thanks for visiting! 
 	 
   
For Writers, Site Marketing & Newsletters 	
Along with my freelance work, I am also in the process of compiling free information for fellow writers, Web site owners and online entrepreneurs. The articles will be posted at my new site, WritersContent.com. These helpful articles and "how-tos" are from various writers and promoters, most of whom are making a living on the Internet. They wish to freely share their knowledge and experiences with others—writers, dreamers, and creative Netizens just like you! 
All the content on WritersContent.com will be available in pdf files, downloadable with just a quick click. You'll be able to print them or read them on your desktop when offline. I'm really excited about this new site and being able to offer this wealth of information to fellow Webpreneurs! 
You will find a variety of helpful and informative topics. If you have any particular subjects you would like to see added, drop me a note, and I'll see what I can find for you. The e-mail link and all information is at WritersContent.com. By the way, in case I forgot to mention it, all the articles at WritersContent.com are free to use on your own sites or newsletters as long as you use the entire article and include the author's name and any resources with links that are provided. And please contact the authors to let them know where you have placed their work. Thank you! Hope to see you over there!
