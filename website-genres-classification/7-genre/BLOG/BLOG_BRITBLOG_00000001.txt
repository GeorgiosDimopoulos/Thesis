One of life's subtle excitements	 
Posted 03/15/05 at 9:10 AM
 	
I know people for whom this means only terror, but since childhood I have always loved drive-through car washes. They're noisy, exciting, loud and a little scary as you wonder whether all the car waterproofing will hold. So, because it was a pleasingly silly thing to do, I took the camera with me on Sunday when I went to the local Jet petrol station clean the bird crud off Beloved Other Half's motor. Look on this less as an exercise in skilful photography, and more as an attempt to capture a moment of childish thrill.

It's coming to get me!
Thus far and no further

East is east and west is west	 
Posted 03/13/05 at 5:21 AM
 	
I don't really know east London - the west is my manor. Outside of the cesspit of my home district, what I'm familiar with is the leafy avenues, smart developments and individualistic parades scattered with quirky little shops that make up places like the Hamptons and Teddington. 
East London's a foreign place, a scary one - mile upon mile of blasted, poverty-stricken rabbit hutches, shading into the impenetrable murk of the Essex marshes. At least, that's what it looks like from my angle - probably nonsense, of course, but if so it's nonsense that I've never had the chance to contradict. 
But these last couple of weekends I've been venturing into the wilderness after my Saturday nights working on the Isle of Dogs. Last weekend I went from there to my parents' house in north Hertfordshire, and this weekend I was desperate to avoid the usual route through central London which was so roadwork-strewn that a journey of some 45 minutes under optimum conditions took just a shade under two hours. 
So for the last couple of weeks I've been heading east from Docklands and picking up the North Circular, past places like Beckton and East Ham, and using that to head home west. 
Now, the North Circular's a road I thought I knew pretty well. I remember it near its western end in Ealing, an apologetic excuse for a road that sidles between houses and junctions, restricted to a single lane and a 30mph limit, as if it expects to get thrown out of the neighbourhood should it assert itself too much and disturb people. 
I also know it in north west London, in Neasden, from my days on the local newspaper there. In that part of London it cruises between rows of shabby houses, a traffic blackspot that delights in slowing down motorists so that it can show off the treasures by its sides - the Ace Cafe, the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Ikea, the World of Leather, the wholesale Chinese food warehouse, the new Wembley Stadium - its arch unnervingly like a slumped and drunken London Eye, definitely a poor substitute for the twin towers of the old Wembley. 
Now I know it in east London, too, and it's a different road altogether there. It doesn't mess around - it's a motorway in all but name, with hair on its chest and a bully's swagger as it bulldozes its way through the capital, shrugging houses and businesses aside as it goes. From five miles away you can look back from an elevated section at the lights of Canary Wharf, and it looks like there's nothing in between that matters. In east London, the North Circular is king and nothing stands in its way. Like Ozymandias, around it the lone and level sands stretch far away. 
I guess it's property prices, and social differences, that are responsible for the difference. West London, for the most part, is where the rich folks live and, while some of the major roads are pretty major, it's impossible to imagine whole districts being levelled to make way for them (airport terminals, of course, are another matter). But no-one cares about the east, apart from the people who live there - and no-one cares about them either. So great areas get bought up and razed to the ground to let roads run through unhindered, and houses cluster together for protection by the side of the new road, houses that used to face more houses a stones-throw away across the street, but which now stare fearfully out on eight lanes of screaming traffic. 
I drove the length of the North Circular tonight, from east to west, and although it was only 37 miles from car park to car park, and a lot of that was on different roads entirely, it really was like travelling between different worlds.

A bold bid for freedom	 
Posted 03/09/05 at 7:47 AM
 	
So I was sitting in the car eating my lunch last week when I heard this loud jangling, clattering noise behind me and swivelled around to see what was going on. Obviously, it was a shopping trolly - no great surprise in a supermarket car park. But this was no ordinary shopping trolly. 
This one had gone rogue. 
It emerged from the empty space between two parked cars with all the serene inevitability of a cruise liner leaving its berth. It was empty, and no-one was pushing it. The car park slopes down to one corner from the store and this trolly was off on an incredible journey all by itself. 
It wasn't a big trolly - more one of those medium-sized ones the stores provide as a compromise between the basket you'd choose for the handful of items you actually came for, and the Titanic-sized one they'd rather you used because they know you wouldn't be able to stop yourself filling it. No, it wasn't big, but it was determined. 
It rattled across the roadway and buried its nose in a flower bed. This would have stopped a lesser trolly in its tracks, but this one wasn't giving in that easily. Although the nose had stopped, the back continued sideways downhill and its momentum freed the other end. When the back caught a moment later, the nose had sufficient speed up to break it free for good. It now had nothing in front of it apart from clear, sloping tarmac, all the way to the far corner of the car park, about 30 yards away. 
And in that corner was an expensive shiny silver Mercedes-Benz, parked all unaware like a whale waiting to be harpooned. 
The trolley hit it broadside-on with a hollow clunk, then spun along its side before coming to rest against a front tyre. For a moment, nothing happened. 
Then, out of nowhere, a stocky little beetle-browed man in an Arsenal FC tracksuit top appeared by the Merc. His expression defied easy description, but combined horror, anger and sheer baffled disbelief. He didn't say anything - no shouting or ranting - but instead swivelled around continually, mouth opening and closing, as if he was searching for someone to unload on. Which he probably was. There was not a person to be seen in the car park. 
I finished my sandwich and drove off, taking a detour to pass by the Merc for a closer look. The dent in the car door was magnificent, the little man still apolplectic as he searched silently, mouth working furiously, for the force of nature that had thrown a shopping trolly at his precious car.

Finally started the actual writing of my sitcom script last night - getting pretty close to the deadline and panic is setting in. Wrote two scenes, and went to bed pleased. Woke up this morning to the realisation that the better of the two scenes was irrelevant to this episode and will have to be cut. Frustrating.

Last night we couldn't be bothered to cook and called out for a chinese. I had spicy szechuan prawns. 
Later, as I first brushed my teeth and then attacked them with Tesco 'Total Care' freshmint flavour interdental woodsticks, the blood that flowed from between them smelled strongly of fish.

Oh boy, do I feel grim. Work Saturday night, a drive up to my parents immediately afterwards, arriving at gone 3am, watching the Grand Prix until five... late night again last night as my body clock struggled to reset itself. And then an alarm clock and work this morning. It's going to be a very bloody day, I fear. 
Edit: Not too bad actually, as it turned out.

Have just added a Flickr photo feed to the increasingly-crowded right-hand column... it serves up five random thumbnails from the (so far) small collection I've uploaded there. Hopefully I'll host most of the photos I post here in Flickr in the future, and maybe catch up some of the past ones too. 
The really good ones are going here from now on though - see if anyone will pay me for them :o)

So little time to write! Just had time to reply to DotBar below and that was it - no time to write up an anecdote from yesterday, or rant about the misdemeanors of my (former) favourite Formula One team, or gloat about the embarrassment currently consuming my favourite football team's most deadly rivals. Will try later. 
In the mean time, here's a photo taken out of the kitchen window this morning. 
Snow falling on the car park 
Got to drive through this later...

Sniffing the fumes	 
Posted 03/01/05 (edited Tuesday, Mar 01, 2005 21:08) at 8:57 PM
 	
It's been one of those weeks when there hasn't been time to write at all. 
A few subjects have bubbled up, but I haven't been able to put in any keyboard time to record them until now. 
There's been the varied delights of driving to work downwind of a coffee factory, which rewards me some mornings with an ferocious burnt smell and some mornings with a sensual golden aroma. It's potluck which I get - if either - and because I have a defective sense of smell, one which usually can't detect a flower held right under my nostrils, I'm equally enchanted by whichever of the two I draw. 
Then there's the hypocrisy of a certain actress who used to play a witch in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and who uses her website to sell photos of herself from the show - the same website on which she writes extensively about her born-again Christianity, with copious Biblical references demonstrating the wrongness of witchcraft. It seems to me that if she wants to evangelise to teenage Wiccan fans of the character she played, she shouldn't also seek to profit by selling them photos of herself supposedly possessed by a demon, or practicing witchcraft, for $20 a pop. One or the other - God or money - not both is what I would have thought. 
Also on the 'things that make me growl' list was the pasty-faced adolescent representing the Adam Smith Institute on Channel 4 News last night. The organisation he belongs to is a radical free market think tank, and it had cobbled together some nonsense argument out of left-over school economics textbooks to explain why Fair Trade, which pays third world producers a decent price for their goods, was actually doing them harm rather than good. Some poor bloke from the main Fair Trade organisation in Britain was on with him, and he just kept looking at this youth with eye-rolling amazement at the things he was coming out with. 
Sadly C4News failed to pick up on the obvious point - which was that because the Adam Smith Institute is so utterly against anything which interferes with the free market, there was never any chance at all of it approving of the Fair Trade movement. Given this, and the sheer intellectual wattage at its disposal, shouldn't it really have been able to put up a better show than some child who'd barely started shaving, wittering on about how Mexico was too rich and how the rise of Starbucks was reducing poverty in Ethiopia? 
So that's been my week. Some things to sniff at and some things to fume at. 
Oh, and today a cat wandered into the office. With uncharacteristic callousness I kicked it back out into the weather - a split-second before it would have vomited over the carpet. 
The cat looked reproachfully at me afterwards through the glass office door, and the rain washed its sick from the path outside. I stayed inside, warm and dry.

But I really *do* want to go to work, honest

Bin there, done that 
The only exit from our flats is blocked by the bin lorry... I sat there for what seemed a lifetime this morning waiting to get through to go to work as they loaded and emptied bin after bin.
