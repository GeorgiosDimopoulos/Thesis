Football, football, football 
Mixed emotions abound at the moment regarding football. Liverpool won nicely the other night, but the match highlighted the truly shite nature of players like Dudek and Traore, whose places in the team are still a mystery to me. Despite their bungling efforts we still won, which has to be good, eh?Then tonight, Barcelona beat Chelsea, which was distinctly heartwarming (not least because I had a little cash riding on the Spaniards). I do have to admit to feeling slightly guilty about cheering the defeat of British teams abroad, however. But then I remember that this particular 'British' team is financed, managed and (mainly) played for by foreigners. And that I don't even like London, let alone Chelsea. So my feelings of guilt soon subside.Finally on the subject of football, there is this little chap, who you may or may not have seen before. It pisses me off seeing a 9-year old do something better than I ever could, can, or will be able to. Bastard.Still, Liverpool won.

Pie Review 
Sainsbury's 'Basics' Pork PieSize: As a snack pie, this certainly did the job. Wouldn't make a meal, but then not all pies have to!Pastry: Pretty poor, it must be said. However, given the size of the pie, it wasn't too noticeable that the pastry was a bit flimsy.Filling: Surprisingly good meat, although not enough jelly.Price/Extras: 30p. 30p! Incredibly good value.Overall: A surprise hit! So cheap, yet so satisfying, particularly given that it was essentially a lump of meat just wrapped in pastry as an after-thought. For a cheap snack, you could do a lot worse. 6.5/10

Pie Review 
Sainsbury's Melton Mowbray Pork Pies (6 pack)Size: For a snack pie these do quite nicely, coming in at 75g each. Stick one on the side of a plate of sandwiches and you have yourself a hearty lunch.Pastry: These do not boast the best shortcrust I've had. It's just a little too soft for a pork pie.Filling: Only 26% of these pies is pork - and not very good pork at that. There's also a distinct lack of jelly, which all good pork pies must have.Price/Extras: £2.28 for 6 is no bargain, but they do keep you going for a couple of days. Unless you get peckish in the night.Overall: Mediocre pork pies. They were passable, but let down mainly by the poor meat.5/10

Pie Review 
John Bullers Steak and Kidney Pie (680g)Size: Top marks, as this is actually a 'family' pie. I was truly stuffed after eating this beast.Pastry: The puff pastry case was reasonable and held up well even when slicing the pie. It's always nice to have a base that holds together.Filling: What there was of the meat was excellent. Nice juicy chunks of steak, but they were few and far between. The kidney was almost conspicuous by its absence, but the gravy was thick and full-flavoured.Price/Extras: I found these pies on a BOGOF offer, which was most welcome at £2.99 each. For those with lesser appetites, this would probably be an excellent value meal for two.Overall: All in all, a very good pie, let down by the sparse filling. It did provide a hearty meal nonetheless and went excellently with some boiled spuds and veg.7/10

The Criteria 
Disclaimer: I am not an official pie-tester. I am not employed by, or affiliated to, any professional consumer groups or pie companies (sadly). Any opinions expressed in my reviews are mine alone and do not really count for a lot, save for the fact that I've eaten a lot of pies and like to think I know what I'm talking about.In general, I quite quickly rate all pies as soon as I bite into them. I form my own opinions rapidly and tend not to analyse the reasons behind each judgment. For the purposes of reviewing, however, I think I need to break down my assessments into a few categories, enabling easy comparisons. I shall rate pies according to the following criteria:Size: In pies, size is definitely important. Obviously the ideal size depends upon the purpose of the pie and the meal that it constitutes. In my view however, a pie should never leave you hungry.Pastry: Whatever kind of pie you encounter, you will almost always need to get through some kind of pastry before you get to anything else. Different pastries perform different functions, but whether it is puff, shortcrust or filo, first impressions count.Filling: I will almost always prefer a meat pie to any other, whatever the circumstances. I'm a bit old-fashioned like that. Having said that, the pie is a versatile beast and I certainly enjoy a sweet pie from time to time, not to mention the odd quiche or tart. All fillings shall be considered and rated accordingly.Price/Extras: I am as price-conscious as the next man, so obviously value for money is important, even in pies. Also, any other remarkable features/uses will go into deciding whether a pie meets my high standards.Overall: All rating systems need a bottom line, and this is it. I tend to find that most pies are greater than the sum of their parts, so this is where I shall give my final verdict. Pies will be rated out of 10.These criteria are not set in stone. Pies have a lovely habit of throwing up surprises for you, and so one must be adaptable. I welcome suggestions about my judging methods and about the types of pie that I review, so either leave a comment somewhere, or preferably email me with suggestions.

Phase 2 Complete! 
The reinvention of the site is almost complete. After extensive customer research (i.e. I mentioned it to my brother) and much careful planning (i.e. I sat on the sofa for a bit), I am ready to give a new lease of life to this blog.From now on, the raison d'être of this site will be to provide reviews of pies that I have eaten. I will happily test-drive pies for people if they have any particular models they're interested in, but otherwise I intend to simply buy and devour as many pies as is humanly possible. An admirable sentiment, I think you'll agree.The next post will outline my criteria for rating and reviewing the pies, and then it shall be 'all systems go'. I intend to deliver at least one pie review each week, but I dare say there will be a large rush to begin with as I get through my staple pies. I still intend to use the blog to rant occasionally about my usual gripes (and Liverpool FC's continuing downward spiral), but other than that, pies are in charge.Bon appetit!

Phase 1 Complete! 
Well almost. I've dispensed with my cobbled-together-and-frankly-a-bit-shit template and taken on a much nicer looking one. Needs tweaking to get it just right, but the bulk of the work is done. "What could possibly be left to do before things get going again?", I hear you cry. Well. I need to decide upon and state my purpose for continuing to blog, because I got a bit bored of my methods before and thought that the site needed to live up to the promise of the title.And so commences phase 2...

It's the winning that counts 
So far, this has been a good weekend for me. First off, I won money betting on the Darts World Grand Prix. I then won money on the superb Liverpool victory and was, to my surprise, pleased with the Spaniards. And just now, Arsenal failed in their attempt to reach 50 games without defeat. All I need now is to be victorious in the pub quiz at my local and it'll have been a nigh-on perfect couple of days.

Guinea pig pie? 
I'd happily eat guinea pigs. And given that there seem to be plenty of them going begging, I may just get to do so. "Where are you off to Biff?""Just going down the local RSPCA home to get some dinner".

Most Errant Prediction of the Day 
"Chav fashion may become something quite cool."Susie Dent, I think you may be wrong. I hope to hell that you are, anyway.

Break time 
I really wish I was good at snooker. Achieving a break of 148 is still a little way off; my current best stands at 27. Practice makes perfect...
