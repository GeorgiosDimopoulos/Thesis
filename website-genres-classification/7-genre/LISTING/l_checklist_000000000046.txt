* the sound of running water makes you jump up and yell, "OUTSIDE!"
 
* you tell your dog to sit, and he backs up until he finds a chair
 
* it takes 3 people to get your dog on the scale at the vets
 
* you walk your dog and everyone knows him by name, but you have no idea who these people are
 
* you can carry on a conversation with a dog's muzzle firmly in your crotch
 
* 
My Great Dane has ARTHRITIS. 
Does yours?
We tried various brands of "glucosamine with chondriotin" pills on our elderly Great Dane, Merlin, and he didn't get the relief we were looking for &#8211; until we switched to a special LIQUID formulation. 
I highly recommend a liquid glucosamine with chondroitin formula to anyone whose dog is suffering from arthritis or hip dysplasia. Liquid formulations offer a 98% absorption rate, compared to pills, which have an absorption rate of just 11-20%.
 
Merlin, who recently celebrated his 10th birthday, is feeling much better now, and I'm completely sold on the product!
