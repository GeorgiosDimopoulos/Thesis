I bet most people have an idea for a movie at some point in their lives.
Most of those people would stop to consider whether their idea is actually any good before sending it off to a Hollywood executive, but not all of them.
One Hollywood executive has started a blog featuring all the worst (or best, depending on your perspective) film plots regularly sent to him.
Some of them barely manage to pass as plausible ideas, but the majority are hilariously terrible.
My favorite has to be the movie about cars that explode in 8 minutes.

According to an email from the Spread Firefox mailing list, subscribed to by anybody who plugs Firefox with their website, the download count hit a whopping 25 million just 99 days after the release of version 1.0.
With a beta release of the seventh incarnation of Microsoft's standards-ignorant Internet Explorer on the way this Summer, it's great to see Firefox fighting for a decent chunk of the market.
In celebration, a few items can be bought from the Mozilla store with a 25% discount, so now is the time to grab your Firefox logo t-shirts.
100 incredibly cool commemorative Firefox coins have been commissioned to mark the occasion, and will be given to the top Firefox promoters and community members.

When I bought this phone over a year ago, it was more a necessity than a luxury. My Nokia 5210, with it's rubbery exterior, had been the victim of a very warm radiator and no longer wanted to call anybody.
It wasn't the 128&#1093;160 pixel colour screen that sold it to me, or even the Java games and polyphonic ringtones. In fact, no matter what music they play, ringtones just annoy me and I keep the phone in silent mode.
The reason I bought the myX-6 was for its built-in camera. The screen is almost as large as screens you find on average digital cameras, and the phone takes photos at a reasonable resolution of 480x640 pixels.
A year later and the video-recording myX-7 has taken over, but I still haven't seen a camera phone that surpasses the quality of photos produced by the myX-6.
A few examples I took today:
Thanks to its age and lack of a video recording facility, you can pick up a Sagem myX-6 fairly cheaply today. Definitely the way to go if you're looking for a cheap and effective camera phone with a decent size colour screen.

03:29:26 pm, Categories: Internet / Web Dev, 62 words       Something is afoot at Google
Quite a few people have noticed a shift in their rankings in Google over the past couple of days.
One of my larger sites dropped from 88 indexed pages to 57 this week, then returned to 88 yesterday.
Some sites have lost some backlinks and I've heard of a few unlucky sites being dropped altogether, which could be the early signs of a big update.

If there's one invention I want to live to see, it's Total Immersion Video Games.
If you remember the classic Red Dwarf episode, Better Than Life, and you should, because it was easily one of the best in the series, then you'll know what I'm talking about.
Better Than Life was a video game system that was able to totally immerse the player, placing them inside a completely interactive reality that existed only in the game. The game allowed players to live out any fantasy they wished, hence the name - 'Better Than Life'.
That game only exists in the realms of science fiction, of course, but the concept is rooted in technology available today.
Computers have been capable of brain wave interpretation for some time, although experiments were always fairly basic, involving little more than moving a dot around a screen.
A bit of Google research brought up a company who claim to produce some basic mind-controlled video games, but I haven't read anything about them until today and can't vouch for their authenticity.
Controlling a standard First Person Shooter (FPS) game is obviously a little more complicated than moving a dot around. Technology capable of recognising and correctly interpreting brain waves related to movement in a 3D environment is far away enough, and that covers only the basics of a modern FPS.
A playable game would have to include weapon/equipment control and interaction with characters, which makes things nice and complicated.
The technology to completely control a modern game with your mind is clearly some years away, but being immersed in a game environment is probably a lot closer.
Most decent gaming PCs are already able to display photo-realistic environments at high resolutions. If you haven't seen any recent graphics demos, take a look at this excellent example of what the Source engine can do. The award-winning Half-Life 2 was built on this engine.
To take advantage of these graphics in a total immersion video game, the images must be fed directly into the brain of the player. The technology to do this is already being used experimentally to allow blind people to see via a camera attached to their retinas, but the quality of the images doesn't yet come close to that of a standard PC monitor.
Time and research should improve this eventually.
The technology to both control and see the game with the mind already exists, albeit in primitive form, which brings us to allowing the player to feel the environment and complete the immersion into the game.
Even the humble Playstation comes with basic equipment to deliver tactile feedback to the player in the form of controllers that vibrate according to events in the game. One company even produced vests and chairs that provided physical feedback to the player.
If an entire suit could be produced to react to events in the game such as movement, physical contact and temperature, then we would have a basic 'immersion suit' for total immersion games.
That would be just one option. The other option would be to trick the brain into feeling various sensations by directly feeding in signals (as in The Matrix), but the suit technology is obviously closer.
The technology is still decades away from being used in the same way seen in that episode of Red Dwarf, but it does at least exist.
