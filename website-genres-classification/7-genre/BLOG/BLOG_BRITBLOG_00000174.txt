Ireland 
I'm off to Limerick tomorrow for a brief visit - out morning, back Wednesday morning. This will double the time I have spent in the Republic, bringing it up to nearly 48 hours.Lily is doing well ta; new bandages today, and still wearing nasty lampshade thing to stop her eating them.House purchase/ sale progressing as well as can be expected. The chain is now complete but no-one has signed anything yet.Oh God. I refer you to this.

Effusive birthday greetings 
It's not only 'diddly diddly bejasus & begorrah mine's a pint of what he's having' day but more importantly my brother's birthday. This in lieu of a birthday card. No no, nothing to click, just this. This blog entry. You don't need a clue. This is it. Happy birthday.

Sentimental twaddle. 
There will be Those Among You - pardon me once more while I populate an Imaginary Readership with readers beyond the legendary Trellis - I repeat, there will be those among you who visit us, even upon recommendation, in search of Swiftian aperçus & tales of Roadway Ironmongery, and who will RECOIL from today's actual offering, a sentimental tale of a dog, and a picturesque injury thereto.A dog, moreover, not named, as are proper dogs, Towser, Bonzo or even Fido but LILY, forsooth, an auburn (ginger) Cocker Spaniel.Last Sunday, this idiot dog, spurning the acres of woodland and park around her, approached and crossed at high speed a busy road. Delighted with her success, she turned around and came back.This time she was struck by a blue People Carrier like this one.She was lucky. Both her back legs were hurt, but neither proved to be broken, goodness knows how. I am now some Â£320 out of pocket as a result, but our gratitude for her light let-off makes that seem cheap(ish).Before and after pix here(There is no blood to be seen, ladies).

A Voyage To Blefuscu 
I opened TextPad and began a piece for this journal or "heap of old rubbish" as we old hands call it, as follows:
In 1965, Diana Ross & The Supremes, while recording would-be million- seller "Lamprey Love"...
...but got no further.I look around me and what do I see? I see people who'd much rather read about how my house is for sale, about my wife's virulent PLANS for our putative NEW HOUSE, and all the jolly mortgagey shenanigans that are about to be unleashed upon us once more. Innit?

The Shortest Way with Dissenters 
When Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) sat down to write what we would come to know as "Pingu's Drunken Moomintroll Sledge Adventure", he can scarcely have imagined that barely 300 years later. Frankly, neither can I.Your search - Pingu's Drunken Moomintroll Sledge Adventure - did not match any documents.

On Manhole Covers - (iv) 
The reason I started on bloody manhole covers is thus:A couple of weeks ago I left the office and was on my way to the tube station, a short walk I must have made a thousand times.My attention was caught by, yes, a manhole cover, or more accurately, an inspection cover. Quite a big one: embossed on it were the words "London County Council Tramways". I thought, knowing that the last tram ran in the early Fifties, that this curiosity will interest one or two of those London Transport geek people, so I'd take a photo and stick it on my moblog. So, I packed my camera and the next afternoon had it at the ready.No cover.Justpavement.Perhaps I'd mis-remembered: maybe I'd crossed the road and it had been on the other side. So I crossed the road the next day. Ridiculous: this is all new development that wasn't even there in 1952.The next day (Thursday) finds me walking up the road, head bent. All the usuals are there: BT, Fire Hydrant etc etc. Not mine. I repeated the exercise on the Friday. And all last week. I am now reluctantly forced to believe one of 3 things:1) It was there and someone moved it at night, repairing the pavement invisibly. This was probably done by Wandsworth Borough Council for the sole purpose of making me look like an idiot;2) I am going mad: I hallucinated a London County Council Tramways inspection cover;3) I am going mad: I dream about inspection and manhole covers and then believe my dreams to be real. In many ways this is the most disturbing scenario. I would not like to be thought of as the kind of person who dreams about manhole covers when I could be dreaming of more manly things, such as former Blue Peter presenters or important sporting institutions.What do you think, readers?Jonathan Swift tells us that "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into". Ca Va.
