       Three and half years, could you recall what you were doing at that age? Probably not. Your mom might told you that you were very naughty, most of the time you were playing with toys. You were very disobedient, insistent and if your demand was not at once fulfilled you were crying for hours… 
But what if a 3 years old toddler operates computer! What if he could finish Microsoft Office package in 20 days! Astonished!! It is true. He is Ansuman Das, the Limca Book of Record holder for 2001 (Page 350) as the Youngest Software Executive of the World.
At this age when kids can’t tell how many colors are there, Ansuman can easily work with Microsoft Windows®, Word®, Excel®, and PowerPoint®. Born on 27 June 1997, the only child of Sandip Das, a USA-based software engineer and Niharika Das, a horticulturist; Babloo as he is fondly called has a passion for computers. Babloo was introduced to computers by his father Mr Sandip Das.(See what he says..). Stunned with his son Ansuman’s extraordinary curiosity in computers he took him to the Aptech Computer Institute in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India. Ansuman completed the 45 days “Vidya” course in just 20 days! In May 2000 APTECH declared Ansuman Das as the youngest computer whiz kid among all its students in its 1500 centers in 30 countries. 
At 3 years Ansuman cleared Microsoft Office® course at kar-ROX Technologies, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India an Authorized Technical Education Center of Microsoft. The management team of kar-ROX were so impressed that Babloo was awarded a Lifetime Membership Card from the institute by which he can take any course in the institute free. 
Ansuman was recently honored with the Annual National Children’s Award 2000 by Fuel Instruments and Engineers (FIE), Pune, India. Ansuman knows Internet browsing, Adobe Photoshop, Ulead Web Utilities, and MS Office. He is learning Visual Basic now!! 
Ansuman Das is a native of Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India. Now he is with his parents in New Jersey, USA.
