Introduction
You and your classmates have been hired by the newly created ENDANGERED ANIMAL PRESERVATION LEAGUE in your very own city to write its first newspaper about ENDANGERED ANIMALS. As part of their educational campaign, each person in this class will publish a mini-newspaper about a specific endangered animal. Each newspaper will be attached to local supermarket bags in an effort to educate the public.
Using KID INFO and Netscape, you are to collect facts and information about your chosen endangered animal, as well as find a photograph of your endangered animal. Your collection of informational facts must include the following details about your animal: appearance (size, coloring, etc.), habitat and home facts (country, type of land or water, nest, caves, etc.), food (what type, how it gets food), life cycle, special adaptations (features that make it possible for it to survive in its habitat), enemies (who), why it is an endangered animal, what is being done to preserve it, and what organizations a person can contact to help. 
You may paste your electronic notes and photograph into any word processing program. After you have collected your notes and photograph electronically, print your notes, and begin a rough draft of your mini-newspaper. You may use any word processing program to create your newspaper. 
Remember that your newspaper must have a title and that you may be CREATIVE and add appropriate graphics, poetry, advertisements, etc. at anytime to act as "fillers"
Good Luck! Sign your work with excellence! Remember that community members will be reading your newspaper!
