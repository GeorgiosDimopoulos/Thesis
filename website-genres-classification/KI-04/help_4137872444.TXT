Getting the Slashdot headlines by 'finger @www.slashdot.org' would be nice, don't you think? Slashdot should cache pages to prevent the Slashdot Effect! Is is possible to have META tags that Slashdot looks for in a story link before allowing it to be submitted/posted? Many times a server can't handle the load of a Slashdotting. So can the site have tags to prevent it from being added to a slashdot story? It seems that many moderators, because of the way they read comments, (higher thresholds, older comments first), only see comments that are posted with a bonus, or have already been moderated up. Wouldn't it make more sense to require moderators to read at a threshold of 0 with newest comments first? Have you ever thought about hiding comment scores when people are moderating? It might help alleviate "Group Think." I have a suggestion for improving moderation. What about other moderation models such as those used by Kuro5hin, everything2, or advogato.org? Will some of the subsections spin off as sites in their own right? I need information about Slashdot for a paper I'm writing! Can I use Slashdot icons freely on my site? I have found a bug on Slashdot, Who do I contact? Ad astra per aspera. [To the stars by aspiration.] All trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective owners.

* What's up with "First Post" comments? 
* Comment posts are getting crappy. What are you doing about it?

* Why don't you give moderators unlimited moderator access to 5 stories instead of giving them just 5 points? 
* I found a comment that was unfairly moderated!
