"I could use a little fun.”

Seamus toed off his worn trainers and curled his legs underneath him on the chair before continuing. “So we get to this club. Music’s thumping, lights are blinking. Looks fun, ya know. But there’s one thing I notice. No girls. Nope, not one bloomin’ bird in the whole place. Well you know what that meant dontcha?”

Dean just grinned.

“Yeah, you got it, mate. Gay club. Just a buncha shirtlifters. So now I’m a little annoyed with myself for not expecting that, but I figure what the heck, music’s good, I need a night out, so I grab a pint, find a piece of wall to lean on, and watch the scene.”

“How was it?” Dean asked, definitely interested in where this was going.

Seamus leaned in closer, letting his friend know they were getting to the best part of the story.

“Well it wasn’t so great at first; just a buncha half-dressed blokes sweating to the beat. So I had another pint while my mate hooked up with some pansies across the bar. Funny thing happened though, once I downed my third round, my feet started tapping and those boys up on that dance floor started looking a darn sight fitter.”

“So, did you dance?” Dean prodded. Honestly interested in Seamus’ tale.

“I was getting to that part. Don’t rush me.”

“Alright. Go on then.”

“Yeah, so I’m leaning against this wall, really starting to feel the music and the beer of course, and this bloke comes up and motions to the dance floor. I think, why not. Looks like it could be fun, so off we go.”

“And?” Dean said impatiently.

“And, you’re rushing me again, Dean.”

“Okay. Sorry,”

Dean sat back again and listened.

“We start to move. Ya know, getting into the beat. It’s amazing how it gets to you. All of a sudden it’s getting hot and this bloke is right there, rubbing against me in all the right places. I’m just going with it, not really thinking about anything but the sounds and the heat around me and then he starts kissing me.”

Dean’s eyes widened and he moved in closer to Seamus, feeling a little flushed himself all of a sudden. “Did you kiss him back?”

“What do you think, Dean? Yeah, I kissed him back. It was incredible. The heat, the feel of that lean muscle against my skin; it was intoxicating, and I don’t think it was the beer.”

“So what happened next?”

“Do you really wanna know?”

Dean’s knees were practically touching Seamus’ at that point, he’d moved so far forward in his chair. He nodded intently, urging Seamus to finish.

“He rubbed me. Right there in the club in front of everyone, although I doubt they noticed; rubbed me right through my jeans and finished me off right there on the dance floor.”

Dean just stared, completely oblivious to anything except Seamus who’d just told him he’d let a bloke practically pull him off in a crowded club. He’d never been so glad the common room was empty as he was right at that moment.

Seamus just stared back, and Dean held his gaze as Seamus’ hand tentatively reached out and his fingers trailed lightly down Dean’s arm. Dean felt the goose bumps rise on his dark skin as his whole body shivered slightly at the touch.

Dean knew Seamus was going to kiss him just moments before their lips touched, and he never moved; just sat there stunned while his best mate slid his hand behind Dean’s neck and pressed his lips more firmly against his own.

God, it felt incredible, and Dean could feel his whole body, especially the lower regions, instantly respond to the closeness.

Dean’s head was swimming, his mind was cloudy, and he barely acknowledged the hand that wasn’t his own creeping slowly across his knee, and then he froze. Seamus pulled back, seemingly to see why Dean had halted the kiss.

Dean looked up at Seamus shakily.

“Fuck!”

“Dean?” Seamus questioned.

“I can’t… I’m not... Just fuck.”

Dean jumped from the chair, knocking his cold tea flying onto the carpet and bolted from the common room and straight up the stairs.

Seamus ventured up to the boy’s dorm a little while later, calling Dean’s name softly as not to wake the other Gryffindor boys.

Dean laid there, eyes closed tight against the darkness, and pretended to be asleep.

~*~

 

Dean folded the creased parchment one more time and set it on the night table.

They hadn’t spoken again since that night. The following morning, Dean had managed to avoid Seamus on the train home by sitting with Neville and Ginny. Seamus, he presumed, had sat in their usual"
"sighed.

""Isn't there another way to do this like civilized beings? A good old duel to the death?"" A beat later Draco dropped unconscious to the floor. ""Well. That was easy.""

Ziggy halted him with a reluctant noise and said, ""Draco Lucius Malfoy has begun his trial. Now sip.""

Is it really worth touching a rim that has borne the kiss of a Malfoy? Of course, he would have felt the same had it been Narcissa. Some blood is tainted. On the other hand… His mind made up, he said so that all in the vault could hear him, ""Let it not be said that a Potter-Black should refuse to walk where a Malfoy has not so graciously gone before."" And he took a swig, the sour, diffusive, coppery taste strong on the tongue and hard down the gullet.


How do vampires get off on this?


Any further sass that he'd had in mind faltered. The vault wavered. He laid a steadying hand upon the desk, seeing double - the surly master-goblin, and a scene of some far away gloomy English day. ""Uh."" He said intelligibly.

""Awaken, or forfeit. The Grail shall answer if you do not.""

Harry sank to his knees, grip still present upon the desk yet quickly slipping, until he had fallen to his rump with his gaze panning up to the swaying lanterns. He could just make out the conversation growing around him as a part of his mind fell away into long centuries past, while another part of his fading thoughts kept his tongue from lolling out the side of his mouth and stopped his eyes from closing.

And then he lost track of the latter.

With a sound like a muggle train-wreck, Harry snapped back into awareness in the middle of a forgotten English field surrounded by hundreds of medieval soldiers in arms shouting war cries. Full iron plate and steel crashed together, maces, war hammers and shields colliding like an orchestra from hell.

Harry clapped his hands to his ears with a curse that would have made Sirius' proud. ""What in the name of Morgana's everlasting rack is going on?""

Several variations involving the remainder of her lovely figure followed as he rolled aside of a handful of knights locked quite literally at the hip and still pummeling each other brutally. Blood leaked like a sieve through mail and ran in thick rivulets down the outside of battered joints, splashing loose with each ringing thud.

Harry's eyes leapt around the violent battlegrounds for a chance to get to his feet and get away. It took him several more moments of narrowly dodging on his hands and knees and, at last, being partially trampled by a pair of yowling jousters, before he remembered that he was a wizard. He closed his eyes and rolled on the spot, feeling that welcome, crushing clutch of Disapparition squeezing him through a pinprick of reality over the literal crushing sensation of iron boots undauntedly stamping his ribs apart. A moment later he could breath again as he reappeared in a grassy plane only a little removed from the brunt of the clashing.

He sat up with a grimace. This was no time to be ginger about the bruising and worse now spanning generously underneath his shirt, as a quick pat down proved he had nothing poking through where it did not belong and everything still attached where it should have been. A shard of splintered wood the size of a Quaffle spun through the air and gouged out the dirt only inches from his left hand as a reminder that this was no place to be for a comparably speaking, naked wizard.

""What did I get myself into now?"" He patted his jeans down and with triumph found his wand holster still tucked away just where he had left it, following Igh'rhuuk's orders in the lobby of Gringotts. And like another train barreling through his brain, he remembered what had lead up to this unfortunate set of circumstances. ""Oh you son of a Quintaped, Ziggy,"" he bit off as he scrambled away from another piece of shrapnel and snapped the holster into place around his right forearm. The supple leather conformed comfortably into place, ready for the correct amount of tension and intent to eject eleven inches of holly and phoenix feather into his awaiting palm.

Finding his feet as the knights continued to bash each other senseless, Harry circled far around them, then began to sight the surroundings for more information. No sign of two particular commanders in charge, or even much in the way of camps, which he assumed meant that the opposing forces had marched and decided to commence battle at once.

No trace of Draco skewered on the end of a pike, more's the pity.

As he examined the dismal landscape further outward, a glint of silver off of a decent knoll to the... north-west, he approximated, caught his eye. Aha. Two horseback men ensconced in unsullied, glistening armor sat there observing the bloody chaos taking place below. Only the taller of the two wore a crown, which meant a noble of some sort. The banners flapping in the cloudy breeze at their backs gave him a moment's hesitation.

"""
"shoulder, he brought it back down with a snarl that exposed yellowed-and-brown canines within nearly lip-less maws, and more than one visualized the enemy that was responsible for their Head's choice - or their own downfall and eventual capture.

For generations, after all, the Nest of Peruvian Viperteeth had played host to the leaders of failed uprisings, whole Clans' kin that had been conquered, or ignoble and untrustworthy members of their society on an individual basis.

Stationed beneath the illustrious eye of Gringotts Bank, they toiled and tolled away for the life of their loan to the Nest, and in return for keeping their undesirable brethren from rampaging through the world, a simple charge of interest was applied on behalf of the Clans' involved - the delivery of worthy titles, deeds to lands desired, and old smith-work long overdue all given over to the Bank's holding.

For many and for the better part of the centuries since its implementation, it was a trade well-viewed by their society.

But for many more into the recent times, it had been a constant Devil's Snare in their ancestral vaults, dragging more and more luxuries away from the victors of each successive uprising.

Only thrice had the goblin society failed to uphold their payments, and only thrice in the history of the Nest had the inhabitants been rallied toward war as a result.

While wizard-kind saw only further goblin anarchy and inter-racial wars, the Nest reminded the rest of their people of why it existed, and why they - and the Bank - would not be ignored.

No one beneath the ground or tending to the affairs of wizards above it would ever breath a word of the Nest's existence to the other races until equality was finally met, and magic shared in equal measure at last.

The pounding that tedious night ceased immediately within three tiers as it was overpowered by a shrill whistle, and from the yawning vertical gap down the middle of the passageways, the Feeder slid down on an ancient chain reenforced with runes.

""Dinnertime, you heaping cur's! Sit down and open up!"" his voice echoed up and down each row as he spun in place, and he produced an Ever-Contracting Spear from a pouch belted to his waist.

The copper tool glistened with a rudimentary shish kabob along its length, scraps of muscle, marrow, and a white-gray goo that was meant to aide in swallowing.

The mass of food was proven to be considerably thinner than it had at first appeared after the spear performed its function, however, shooting forward and pinning the slanted point into the eastern wall firmly.

Despite being reduced to at-most three bites per goblin, they still fell upon it like a murder of taunted crows. Fingers pinched and pulled and scraped at it, eroded incisors bit hard into the cool metal beneath, and with those who actually had proper strength available, a new set of scratches marred the surface of the haft when they were done.

The Feeder shook his end after mere seconds, dislodging any last-gnawers, and the tool retracted back into a more manageable length as he turned about and dipped it into the pouch to repeat the process for the other three rows around him.

The last slave at the far end of the eastern row, still licking his chops irritably, fingered the pickaxe's point as he eyed the Feeder.

His tendons itched to leap and drive a blow that would kill the employee, to take into his own hands a weapon once again and then press its lovely tip straight into the magical eye spiraling around within the Watcher's skull when he descended like the carrion-spit he was to survey them again.

He longed for the time now far past when he had heralded fresh blood spilt out of the enemies throat across virgin soil, and taken first pick of the spoils of war thereafter.

It was a thought commonly shared by the others in the nearby tiers. And like those others, he swallowed his bloodlust with a final lap of his pitted tongue across the stubs of his teeth, scraping up the very last drop of goop clinging to the gums.

Once the Feeder dropped down and out of sight only seconds later, another rusted chain appeared as the Watcher descended from above.

Whereas the Feeder was merely ugly in the traditional sense, with the blood of a house elf only two sires back, he at least had the grace to cover up his oddities behind a cowl and veil.

The Watcher did not.

Smoother, human-tainted ears, an softer nose, and that despicable wizard-crafted blue eye rushing about in every direction were all displayed, and it was boasted of loudly and often that the cat o' nine tails strapped to its' precious belt contained the remnants of a broken wand inside of the device.

Gray hair hung from the ears and met around the back of the head to keep it well away from the eyes, and the brown-red of the remaining natural pupil stared defiantly down each row as he examined them for hints of mutiny.

He couldn't even deign to wear natural goblin-crafted clothing or armor, foregoing it in favor"
"the swish of his third and incomplete spell carried no meaning behind it.

I rolled away from the rush of wind and flame, protected in part by my cloak, letting it pitch my body forward as he banished the desk across the tiled floor. One hand gripped the surface as I flew over and allowed me the strength to grow stable in the chaotic flight and land on my knees roughly, painfully, but not in defeat.

He turned in an instant to finish what his work had started; but too late, that single instant too late, for I had never ceased my motions even through the destruction of each knee.

The rage burning behind his eyes flared higher as my Chaser-honed reflexes tore the wand from his minutely-weaker hands, and in that moment a low pang of regret registered behind my satisfaction of taking up his Hallow.

My weaker wand appeared in the opposite hand as I banished his body backwards into another portrait of long-dead headmasters, finally taking in their shouts and panic as further flame licked up along their walls.

A basic healing charm undid the damage to my legs in a flare of light and a rush of giddiness as Dumbledore pushed up onto one arm, the shame of both his actions and his defeat openly displayed.

""Thank you for the knowledge... and the gift, headmaster."" I told him softly, freezing the fires in place before any more damage could be sown, rationale returning but unaffected by my victory.

With two in my command the power only coursed that much stronger, like a kindling-flame grown wild before a sudden supplement of consumption.

""James... wait..."" he murmured weakly, too slowly.

I vanished his desk and descended the stone stairway before he could even finish my name. I knew there was only one last to be obtained and then the prophecy would no longer matter, that it could not matter were I lord of them each and all.

Lily could feel the changes in me the moment I walked inside our home, the undisguised look of confusionon her face, but it hardly mattered.

I loved her still, of course, that much had not yet been altered; but I knew after listening to Dumbledore's brief history lesson just what would become of that love in due time, just as it had become of his favor toward Grindelwald, of his own brother and sister.

And a part of me I had not known existed, had perhaps not even been before tonight, whispered it's loathing of her softly in my heart. ""James? What happened? What did Albus say to you?"" She asked in concern.

To lie, or not to lie.

I could not let her take in the Hallows as I had, sharing them as I once did my cloak so foolishly in blind youth. And then I heard his cries and that whisper grew silent for a time, as Lily turned with a moment's hesitation to look in on our son.

""I'll tell you later."" Her eyes grew more concerned before exiting the room and I knew then, taking in Harry's whimpers and whines as the sound both soothed the urges and bore a hole within my heart, that he would be the one capable of washing away their stain one moment at a time.

It made the anguish that formed later as he slept quietly all the more powerful.

With only two in my possession I could not stop the prophecy from coming true, I could not keep either of them safe... yet just how much safer would they be beneath Albus' Fidelius charm without the third Hallow clasped in hand? How long would it take before their blood drenched my hands then?

A high pitched voice cast out the first curse quietly, calmly, and the door exploded inward as only so much ash and splinters. His followers crept at an equally quiet pace forward with the occasional note of mirth escaping from behind stark-white masks.

Upstairs Lily paced in silent madness, protected by several wards I had forced Sirius and Remus into casting a week prior, just before my resolve at last folded from the search.

It was as much to keep her away from Voldemort as it was away from me, though more than once I had tested the measures. Only Harry's voice kept them both alive and safe for another night, another hour, until tonight.

Voldemort himself looked for a moment to stall. His features seemed, perhaps, confused at the sight that greeted the glimmering-red eyes. I supposed my own descent must have looked equally familiar if disturbed, hazel eyes long since darkened to black.

The cloak rested over my shoulders and trailed the ground with a wary note of amusement in the way it never stayed still, wavering as if in a wind no one else could feel or hear.

The wand tapped against my left thigh to a beat of its own choosing, reverberating faint echoes of magic in the wake of each.

And the last, the final of the Hallows, the stone-bound-in-ring glinted on my left finger with an inner-chaotic gleam.

The Death Eaters at his back looked in around their master's shoulders and took note of me"
"kiss him gently before he pulled away and straddled him. He looked down at the hard cock and licked his lips slowly before ducking his head and flicking an agile tongue over the hard flesh “hmmm….you always taste so good” he purred before he looked around for what he needed. Lube for sure, the toy itself and he was ready. He looked down and smirked before grabbing one of the sterile cloths they always had nearby, gently wiping Severus’s cock head with it slowly, partly teasing and partly cleaning “you can speak you know” He teased, seeing his lover turn his face to the side at the teasing touches to his sensitive head.

Damn that fool and damn himself for agreeing to such a stupid thing! He was actually glad he was restrained; this way he would have an easy out to deny he wanted anything of the sort. Though he had to admit, the toy looked interesting even if the thought of something sliding…there scared him half to death. He, Severus Snape, Spy for the good against the darkest wizard to ever be born and he was afraid. He closed his eyes, taking comfort in not being able to see but he found he couldn’t do it! His eyes kept fluttering open and glancing down and after a pair of smug green eyes met his and a dark eyebrow was raised in challenge, he focused his eyes on his cock in an effort to keep whatever face he had left. The toy itself was nothing horrendous; it was actually a very simple looking toy. Apparently one for beginners the top had a dome-like feel to it. It would slide over the head of his cock while a skinny rod extended from the middle down a few inches. It was a little longer then his middle finger and he swallowed hard when Harry was finished cleaning him. A small foil packet of lube was picked up and torn open. Now here he expected the toy to be lubed but...shockingly [i]he[/i] was the one lubed, or at least the inside of him was. Harry held his cock straight up and gently poured some of the cool lube directly into his urethra; making sure enough went in before he put the foil package down and began to stroke slowly. His hips shifted, brow furrowing as he could feel to cool lube squishing inside of him and wasn’t sure if he liked the feeling or not. It seemed to be on the fence and didn’t last long enough for him to decide. Instead Harry pulled his hands away and began to smear the remainder of the lube onto the long stick of the toy, all the while those green eyes were locked onto him and it made him shiver. He licked dry lips, swallowing hard as he watched the toy approach. “Harry..” he murmured, heart pounding with trepidation as he bit his lower lip. 

Oh Severus, his lover was so brave for not telling him to go to hell when he had brought it up. He wouldn’t have faulted his older lover if he had! Hell listening to the entire explanation would have taken guts, he wasn’t sure he would have been able to were their roles reversed. Harry cupped the man’s face, thumb stroking his cheek “you don’t have to Sev, It’s alright really” he said as he kissed the man gently, only to pull back with a yelp as his lower lip was bitten. “Don’t be stupid Potter! Hurry up” Was snapped at him and he stared in confusion before a grin slid over his lips. There’s his snarky lover! Sliding back down, he grasped the hard cock again, lifting the toy and gently sliding it into the slit. He didn’t push or wriggle it. He just held the cock straight and made sure the toy didn’t fall to the side as it slid down under its own weight.

A sound was heard and it took him a few minutes to realize that sound was him! He arched his head back on the sheets, biting his lower lip to muffle anymore embarrassing sounds as his hands fisted. He wasn’t sure what he expected, really he couldn’t begin to fathom the feel of having something [i]inside[/I] his cock but this? This was not anything ;like he had been expecting. This feeling of…fullness! He had no idea the inside of a man’s cock was more sensitive then the outside! He couldn’t begin to describe the feeling of having something rub against his inner walls as it slid down, filling him in a way so completely different from when he was taken and yet so close it made his heart race. By the time the dome settled over the tip of his cock, Severus was a mass of twitching nerves and pre cum. It was an amazing sight, made even more so by the fact that the slightest touch to the sound sent Severus into a fit of pleading mewls as he struggled against his bonds. He smirked before lowering his head, tongue nudging the toy just to make Severus shout. He only became more aware"
"hear you if they were close enough, you will yourself to breath slower, and hope that the castle halls are as deserted as they seem.

The sight of her leaning against the statue near the library is what keeps you leaving the warmth of your bed each night; her long, wild curls framing her face, and her dark eyes that melt you to the very core. Your breath hitches as you take in the sight of her, the beauty that is her, and you approach slowly, taking her outstretched hand.

“The library tonight.” she whispers, sending chills through every nerve ending in your awakening body. You nod slowly, knowing you will follow her anywhere she wants to take you as long as she doesn’t let go.

You never really understood why she comes, and why it’s you she wants. You are proud of your house, but you are a Slytherin, which in her eyes should be a danger sign. But as her Gryffindor bravery would suggest, she is never fearful, only passionate and loving and willing to give you a chance.

She leads you through the looming shelves of books, into the restricted section. Your face must show your uncertainty at the location because she runs her palm lightly across your cheek and whispers softly. “No one will find us here Pansy, I promise.” You relax into her touch and her soothing voice. You trust her; you always have.

Pushing you gently against the towering shelf of books, she removes her hand from your face, and you shiver at the loss of contact. Just as quickly she fills the void with her warm lips, kissing your cheek and slowly making her way to your waiting mouth. Your fingers reach up to tangle in her hair, and she pushes forward, gently parting your lips with her tongue.

A quiet moan escapes you as her hands trail down your back, pulling you into her and deepening the kiss. You can already feel the wetness building, dampening your cotton underpants and causing you to press your hips closer to her warm body. She responds by moving her mouth to your neck, and trailing kisses from just below your ear, down your collarbone, to the opening of your blouse.

The feel of her tongue on your flesh is intoxicating and you breathe deeply, taking in the scent of her hair brushing your skin. Her hands move around to the front to work on the buttons covering your taught nipples. Each tiny button brings her closer to your bare breasts, and the thought of what happens next has your head clouded with want.

You have done this many times before, but every time is as thrilling as the first. You can’t get enough of her hands, her lips, and her audible sighs as she lifts your blouse from your shoulders and lets it slide to the floor behind you.

Before you have time to breathe, her fingers are on your nipples, rubbing them gently between her thumb and forefinger, causing them to stand out and eliciting a moan of pleasure and acceptance from your swollen lips. Her fingers are quickly replaced by her beautiful, full mouth as her hands work down to the waistband of your skirt, sending shivers of excitement straight through to your core.

Within moments, but what feels like a lifetime, your skirt is pooled at your feet, and your knickers are circling your ankles. Her eyes move appreciatively over your naked form and you can see the heat in her flushed cheeks. She is as aroused as you are, and the idea makes you even more so.

Deciding your nipples still need her rapt attention, her mouth continues where it left off, her tongue mapping small circles around the hardened flesh. You gasp as her fingers trail slowly down to the patch of soft, wet curls where your thighs meet, and she slides her long finger slowly over your swollen clit. Your hips roll involuntarily, needing her touch, and never wanting it to ever stop.

“Hermione, please…” you hear yourself whimper, your legs threatening to give out underneath you and send you both sprawling on the floor. “Inside me, please.”

She moans at your words and pushes against you, positioning her still-clothed body against your thigh, pushing into you with her hips and then with her finger, sliding deep inside your wetness with a single thrust.

Her body stills for a moment, feeling the heat of your walls tight around her finger, then, unable to control her excitement, she begins to move, rubbing herself against your thigh. She slides her finger in and out of you, the heel of her palm brushing against your clit with each stroke.

You know you’re almost there. You can feel the intensity building deep inside you, your breathing ragged, and your hips moving in pace with her hand. You close your eyes and just feel, feel the fire explode, igniting every nerve ending in your body, covering her fingers with your sweet release.

She pushes against you one more time, watching you come, causing her to moan out her pleasure from the friction, as she too reaches the pinnacle of her orgasm and shudders into your shaky arms.

Somehow you both"
"Every night they brought them.  New sacrifices to feed the ravenous ache and dull the pain she felt inside.  The ache in her chest became almost unbearable.  The mixed feelings of hunger and necessary surrender enveloped her every night just before they came.  Ginny hated feeding with intense passion.  She loathed the hunger that claimed her body, but she needed the sustenance, and that awareness surpassed the hate.

Eventually she knew they would stop bringing them to her.  They would expect her to be the predator; track down her own prey and drink without mercy.  She would do it, not because she wanted to, but because each night it became easier to mask her repulsion at what she had become.  She mourned the loss of life for a while, but she was learning to accept it as inevitable, a part of her altered existence.

They told her she didn’t have to kill them; that she could control it, but she didn’t know how.  The hunger was too powerful and all consuming.  The metallic taste on her lips was like a drug, an addiction she couldn’t deny, filling her and giving her strength.  She couldn’t understand the want of control when her every desire was being met at that moment.  But she needed to learn, because the guilt was waning.  If that happened, Ginny knew she would lose that small part of herself that still remained.

On the seventh night they fulfilled her greatest craving and deepest fear.  Hermione had never looked so beautiful or so afraid.  Ginny’s resolve strengthened.  This was the time the control really mattered and she would master it.  She had to.  She ran her hands through her lover’s stubborn curls, inhaling the scent she knew so well.  Her heightened senses deepened her longing.  This time it was real.

One finger trailed down a milky smooth throat.  Skin so lovely it was almost too perfect to mark, but not quite.  Ginny’s lips pressed gently in a kiss meant to soften the pain, but it wasn’t enough.  She could feel the tense shoulders indicating Hermione’s fear, and she tried to reason with her lover’s pleading whispers against her pounding heart.  A strangled moan escaped Hermione’s lips and Ginny felt the girl fall into her embrace as she began to drink from the warmth of her veins.

The taste was intoxicating.  Better than anything she had ever known.  How easy it would be to take her fill, drink until her hunger was completely satisfied, and feel the lovely girl collapse in her arms. 

She had to stop.   Now.  Before it became impossible.  Battling her deepest urges, she pulled away slightly, dipping her tongue into the wound to catch the last coppery taste.  Ginny relaxed and felt her body slump to the floor, pulling Hermione to her side and holding her close.  Her fingers trailed softly over Hermione’s pale face, and she whispered endearments and apologies that would never be heard.  She rested her hand on the sleeping girl’s chest, feeling it rise and fall, knowing she had finally learned; knowing that love was what it took to make it real."
"I?”  “Ugh, you know he'd be more likely to work with you.” And like that, though the moment of seriousness should not have passed so soon, they were back to their usual banter.  “Is he still bitter over your colors at our first World Cup? Honestly mate, just challenge him to a wand measuring contest and let the matter be done, everyone knows you supported Ireland as a whole and Viktor for his own merits.”  Ron waved a hand dismissively in his direction. “Sure, let's get into a pissing match for the whole Ministry to snicker about. Sorry blighters don’t have enough rumors in the mill as it is?”  Harry sighed.  That, however, was hardly the correct choice of response to a man who went to sleep nursing a headache and woke up drunk instead of the other way around. Ron set his expression the way Ginny would after a row, and under that withering stare Harry held up his hands in surrender.  ""Okay, I'll deal with Rourke."" 

 



Later than expected Harry’s feet carried him before the closed door labeled Emery S. Rourke, Director of Magical Transportation. As expected the man’s wireless was reporting on the finale between Egypt and Bulgaria loudly enough to make out each call clearly, and Rourke’s mutterings underneath when the announcer paused to breath. With such a ruckus Harry did not see much point in knocking. He turned the knob and stepped inside of the wide office overflowing with Quidditch memorabilia and only as many markings of station and books pertaining therein to Portkeys and Floo powder as to satisfy the standard set by Rourke’s predecessors.

“Morning, Emery.” The older wizard, reclined in his seat and staring up at a poster of Ireland on the ceiling overtop the department seal seemed to not hear Harry. I suppose it was for the best that Ron didn't come here today. Unfortunately Harry was also not in the mood to wait around for very long, and when still the director had not acknowledged him even after striding right up to Emery’s desk, Harry drew his wand and silenced the radio.

“-bloody Seeker couldn’t catch a Snitch if it was right underneath his nose--” after a moment Emery’s swearing against Victor Krum paused in mid complaint and he thumped his chair legs back to the carpeted floor, shaking his moppy brown hair into his blue eyes. “What the blazes do you want, Potter? Zaghloul has him on the edge of his wits!”

“Morning, Emery,” Harry repeated dryly. “I need to secure transport for myself and Ron overseas.”

“Oh, that prick?” Rourke scoffed. “Then he can come down here himself unless you’re under orders from the Minister. Now if you would I’d like to return to the match-” and he jabbed at the wireless with his own wand from the folds of a sleeve and the noise returned.

Harry was not amused. “No, we aren’t under orders. This is a personal favor.” He had to raise his voice to be heard, and Rourke waved his hands as if the matter was thus inconsequential compared to the finale and kicked back from his desk again as Egypt scored. It was quite tempting to bewitch the radio to dance through the other stations until it found Celestina Warbeck’s 21 hour tribute to love, but resorting to such a tactic would only be a short lived satisfaction.

One way or another Ron and I are going to be meeting with Charlie tomorrow. Still, he’d rather do this legitimately. A quick Portus might save them a few minutes of wearing down Rourke’s resistance, but crossing the borders would certainly send up sparks somewhere in this and another office and then they’d be receiving a few strongly worded admonishments signed in the Minister’s name at the very least.

He took a slow breath and on the exhale decided to pull a page out of the late Albus Dumbledore’s playbook, and conjured up a large plush armchair. Then he sat down, kicked up his trainers over Rourke’s desk, and folded his arms behind his own head to listen to the match. There were worse ways to spend time than listening to the latest World Cup coming to a close.

For almost half an hour Rourke attempted to ignore him. Harry quietly rooted on Victor and Bulgaria as Rourke swore about both teams, particularly whenever Egypt lost the Quaffle and the score rose in Bulgaria’s favor, on which occasion Harry would whistle softly in appreciation of Victor’s teammates. Rourke kept glancing at him from the corners of his eyes on such moments and his muttering would momentarily pause, then resume with more vigor. Eventually as the hour drew on and the referee called a break following a collision between the Egyptian chaser and one of Bulgaria’s beaters Rourke sat up with a dissatisfied curse.

“Damnation! Alright, Potter, spit it out before the match resumes, and then get the hell out of my office so I can enjoy this in peace!”

Finally. Harry unfolded his arms and lowered his feet to the floor. “We need to be in Bucharest"
"cave entrance, swirling, false wind bringing with it tired limbs, warm-safe-hollow, let head sag just so, eyes fall closed.  She fights it, claws piercing rock, the hard slap of her wings against the cave wall, her tail thrashing.  Fire swells up her throat and curls against the roof of her mouth before streaming out in a wild burst.  She follows the fire, does not fear what is hers to own, will not let these heart-of-dragons near her young, her fire and ash to be.

Her head clears the cave, bursting through the lingering swell of fire.  She shrieks at the sight of the interlopers, a high, keening knife of sound that leaves the air humming where it touches her scales.  She lunges for the closest, a flash of color, the bitter sweet scent of magic and prey.

Pain explodes in her eyes, the suddenness of it snapping her head around, wings slapping the air.  Her tail whips around and smashes through rock.  Something screams and the scent of fresh blood is heavy, warm, draws her lips back from her teeth in a satisfied hiss in spite of the pain.

She cannot see but she can smell them, hear their strange calls as they scurry around her.  More flame pours from her mouth, her eyes throbbing, making her twist and thrash as she tries to escape, to get away but also to hurt, to protect the mouth of the cave tucked behind her.  The air swells, heavy and thick with magic yet to come, her flaming snarl spilling sulfur and brimstone until there is nothing beyond pain, heat, fear, rage.

She is hit from all sides, explosions of power that are nothing like the clash of scales, no teeth or claws to fight, wings fluttering helplessly.  The world fades as she falls, a high whine building as the fire dies in her throat.

When she wakes the pain is gone, replaced with a cold that seeps between her scales, licks at the fire of her heart.  She smells the bitter-sharp brimstone and flame of other dragons, hears their roars and shrieks, is helpless to do anything but answer them.  She snarls at them, the closest sun on rolling hills of green scales, pulls at that which holds her, sharp clicks that rest so very cold against her scales.  Bitter salt on flowers are everywhere, crawling, soft creatures that watch her, smelling of magic and fear. 

The others are dams-to-be, dull scent of fire and ash to be muted by the shell lingering between them all.  They shriek and call, want their young, to escape the cold.  She claws the ground, pulls and thrashes, high keens that split the cold and send the bitter salt on flowers scurrying about her.  She wants her young, can smell the dry curve of their shells if she lifts her head just so.  They are close, so close but she cannot find them, cannot reach them.  Sun on rolling hills of green snarls at her, and she snarls back, tail whipping around to puncture soft dirt with her spikes. 

Too many dams-to-be, poachers, death-bringers who do not want to share the world with her fire and ash to be.  She wants to tear at their scales, drive them from this place of everlasting cold, protect her young if only she can find them.  The crawling, chirping heart-of-dragons gather around her twisting, shrieking form, gathering power around them.  She lunges but is brought up short, can only roar defiance as she is once more brought low, the cold dirt pressing against the thin scales along her jaw.

When she wakes the scent of bitter salt on flowers is overwhelming, a low thunder of noise coming from all directions.  It makes her spines bristle, wings stretching as she rises, but before she stands she stops, a low croon of surprise as she smells the dry curve of fire and ash to be.  She sweeps her head over the eggs, humming as she counts, each one dry and sharp but different, settles back into place when she finds none missing.  There is one that is cold, not one of her fire and ash to be that she pushes away from the others, hisses at it before dismissing it. 

She hisses at the endless roar of sound, flame curling at the edges of her teeth when another scent catches her attention.  Slewing her head around she sniffs the ground near her eggs, snarls when she smells other dragons.  She moans, a low sound of pain, fear, terror, jerks her head back from the scent of fire and ash to be exposed to the world before time was right, the cloying scent of death. 

She curls tighter around her young, wings pressed tight to her back, spiked tail pushing her eggs closer to the soft heat of her belly.  Bitter salt on flowers are all around, there is no where she can go, something heavy fastened around her neck, bruising the scales beneath her chin and crest of spines.  She cannot fight, her searing breath will not reach from where she is crouched amongst them"
"preferable to the female senses than armpit and crotch sweat, or so he’d been told on most occasions.   The sleepy little village felt peaceful, few lights still lit in the windows he passed, while he was wide awake and rarin’ to go, and a wicked smile played about his lips as he thought, She may be in bed, but she won’t be asleep this soon. We both expected the match to go on much longer.  Thus, as he came upon the newly renovated Potter household, the idea filled him to surprise his would-be-wife and proceed to ravish her to within an inch of their lives.  He shrunk both bottles then and slid them into a pocket, a quick, whispered sticking- and silencing charm muting any clinking that could occur. He checked to be sure the perimeter klaxon remained primed around the household and carefully toed his way through it, nudging this way and that past the wards using the field experience acquired during his brief stint as a curse breaker under Bill's guidance several years ago. In no time at all he was on his merry way, door gliding silently shut at his back, tiptoeing past the stairs to the upper floor and the bedroom adjacent it, and through the doorway into the kitchen.  He added two shrunken wine glasses, a bottle of powdered cherries and can of cream from the pantry, and a dish towel for cleaning up afterward into his pockets. Then he made his way around to the remodeled first floor bedroom, alohamora’d the bedroom door and swung it open, beaming, only to stop dead in his tracks at the sight that greeted him.  Ginny sat on the edge of their bed in her soft pink nightie, a gradually filling bucket between her spread legs, her hands wrapped around the finest set of udders he had ever seen on a feathered cow. “Oh!” she exclaimed between motions. The cow mooed distressingly, turning a shapely head that contoured more toward the avian than the grass-eater. Hard fiery blue eyes glared at him.   “Is that…"" a magical cow in our bedroom at a quarter to eleven, what kind of secret kink is this? He decided against blurting that out and asked instead, ""... what is going on?”  Ginny's nimble fingers resumed action, tugging on the fat udders. The cow mooed again rather moodily. ""I know you weren't expecting company, Harry. But she found me at the hospital at the end of my shift and I couldn't just leave her there, not after the ceremony."" Nonplussed at the situation, all he could do was stand there watching. She squeezed, another rich burst of milk gushing into the already too full bucket, and as a result over splash dashed across her pale legs from mid-thigh to ankle.   ""Oh. Dear, won't you lend a hand?"" Ginny reached down to wipe carelessly at the glistening milk with her fingertips, edge of her nightie jumping with the movement.  Harry felt his pulse do a little jig. Thank Merlin this isn't some mad fetish. This isn't the norm and I can get clearer answers later. ""Sure thing, Gin,"" he said.  He took out the towelette in one hand and his wand in the other, a few choice spells loosening his belt and slinging it over the nightstand. He vanished the contents of the bucket without much concern for where exactly it went. Then he knelt down, passed his fiancee the cloth, and took the nearest weeping teat into hand.  Ginny knew how to play her audience. She spread her legs further, leaned back to offer more light, lifted one leg up to better reach her sole, and with his emerald gaze burning intently on her every move Ginny wiped up the proxy for his cum. She smiled wickedly at the rising in his jeans, the rush of his breath, delighting that he was always so pliable after a hard match.  Harry's grip momentarily yanked instead of firmly pulled. In response, the cow's sturdy tail swung ‘round and clocked him on the side of the head. Harry winched at a blow to shame a bludger and lost his balance, stumbling backwards, his hands reaching out for the nearest available surface as he fell - which just so happened to be the front legs of the feathery bovine. His wand clattered somewhere to the side as it rolled away and the cow mooed in desperate protest.  Then they thudded to the floor together, and most of the air in his lungs exploded out in a violent, ""Oomph!"" of protest. But when Harry blinked opened his eyes he found those startlingly bright orbs up close and glaring at him from the hawkish lines of the creature's face, only scant inches over his own. So close that, had he not known better, he would have sworn on his godfather's grave that they really were human underneath.  Ginny stifled a laugh at his consternation. “Oh, Harry, how do you keep getting into these situations?”   He motioned desperately for Ginny’s assistance as he tried to no avail to push the cow up by physical force alone"
"did, but his nine to five at Gringotts left him completely bagged by the end of the day. Staring at the telly didn’t help, and neither did reading. Both just left his eyes fuzzy and usually ended with him slumped on the sofa when Harry returned late at night.

He’d begged Harry to quit, telling him he’d done enough in the fight against Voldemort, but Harry wouldn’t hear of it. Draco suspected he still had some of that hero complex left over from his Hogwarts days, or maybe it was just that Gryffindor need to help anyone who asked nicely. Harry didn’t need the money, and his daily Auror work left him tired enough. Draco just didn’t think helping new Auror recruits with field work was really necessary. Not to mention what it was doing to their sex life.

By the time Harry got home each night, Draco was sound asleep and there was no hope of rousing an exhausted Harry at seven in the morning for a quick shag before work. Draco didn’t even like to think about how lonely it was when Harry was gone in the field for days at a time.

Draco stared at the half-empty take-away containers on the coffee table and yawned as he checked the clock. Half past ten. He only had another hour or so to go. He’d promised this time; even went as far as leaving Harry a note that morning.


“I promise to wait up for you.”


It’d seemed like a great idea that morning: a bottle of wine, some Muggle classical music, a roaring fire in the grate. Everything a couple needed for a romantic Friday night. They’d had so little time together lately, Draco had almost forgotten what it was like to make love into the wee hours and fall asleep in a contented haze.

Quarter to eleven. Draco raked his fingers through his hair and down over his eyes, rubbing them awake. Maybe a cup of strong coffee would help.

The kitchen was quiet but for the low hum of the refrigerator. Draco poured himself a cup of the coffee he’d made after dinner, deciding against adding milk or sugar. The coffee had been there several hours and he hoped the thick, black liquid would be enough to keep him awake just a little longer. He’d promised, and this time he wasn’t giving in to his overtired body and stinging eyes.

Making his way back to the sofa, Draco glanced once more at the clock. Eleven. If Harry was on time, Draco thought he might just make it. Only thirty more minutes. He could do that. He settled himself on the sofa, kicked the leftovers to the side of the coffee table making room for his slippered feet, and waited. Maybe if he just closed his eyes for a minute…

The gentle softness of fingers carding through his hair woke Draco with a start. He opened his eyes slowly to see Harry looking down at him with a silly grin on his face. “I knew you wouldn’t make it.”

Draco wasn’t giving in to defeat that easily. “I’ve been awake the whole time, Potter. I just wanted to rest my eyes for a moment.”

Harry just laughed. “I’ve been sitting here watching you sleep for almost fifteen minutes, you prat. You looked so peaceful I didn’t want to wake you. Anyway, it doesn’t matter anymore.”

Draco sat up a little and reached for the coffee he’d poured a few minutes ago. He took a large sip and promptly spat it out. Maybe he had been asleep for a while; the coffee was like ice.

Draco considered Harry’s words. “What doesn’t matter anymore?”

Harry grinned. “I quit. You don’t have to wait up for me anymore. No more late nights. No more trips away. I’ll be home every night for dinner. I might even be home before you.”

Draco looked at Harry with trepidation. “Why? Why did you resign?”

Harry looked at Draco with a gentleness that Draco hadn’t seen in some time. He hated to admit he’d missed it, but the truth was he had. Harry’s voice was soft and quiet when he finally answered. “I missed you.”

Harry seemed to lower his gaze as if missing Draco was a weakness he was embarrassed to admit. Draco had to agree it was pretty soppy, but that didn’t stop his heart from doing flip-flops at the thought. Truth was, Draco missed Harry too. Not just the sex, which was definitely spectacular, but he missed just spending time with the man he’d lived with for six years.

Draco pulled Harry down beside him on the sofa and gently trailed his hand down his lover’s back. “I’m glad you’ll be home more. I miss the blow jobs.”

Harry laughed as he snuggled in beside Draco. “Admit it. You actually like having me around.”

Draco started to protest, but the tone"
"swift Finite, looking around at the few scattered implements he still had to put away in his trunk. ""Yeah, Draco?"" he called back as he strode over to the door and pulled     it open. The Malfoy heir stepped in after a moment and looked around   the   rather small guest bedroom, as if seeking something. ""I  see you haven't gotten the train ticket anywhere in sight- which is   good to   see you've remembered- only you haven't gone and misplaced it,   have   you?"" he asked rather haltingly all at once. Harry  recognized it as faint anxiety, and it was good to know that he     wasn't the only one. ""No, I packed it away with most of my books a   month   ago."" He answered. Draco nodded.

""Alright,  then. Breakfast is ready and mother said to  have   everything packed  up beforehand, so we can head out at ten  o'clock   sharp."" His gaze  lingered on the items sticking out like sore  thumbs. Harry nodded in turn.

""Thanks, Draco. I'll be down in a minute."" He    responded and turned  to rush over to his trunk. Draco sighed at the loss    of proper stance  and the haste of his sort-of-cousin- the books were    rather vague and  the Wizengamot hadn't clarified in easily digestible    terms. At best, it was Draco's own mother that was Harry's nearest-cousin,   just   as it was Harry's godfather that was his own nearest-cousin. What  they were might not even technically count by law given the distance between their respective branches. Whatever the case was, however, they were still relatives, and Draco     respected that and the effort Harry was making to adapt to their way of     life. He waited until the last book and the clock were set  nearly-neatly into    the trunk at the foot of the bed and then shut  before he stepped up  to   help drag the lumbering weight down the  stairs with him. Harry smiled gratefully.

 

 

 

Apparition was among the worst sensations Harry thought he would ever    encounter. He gasped and nearly collapsed to the ground when they    arrived on the platform, shrunken trunk in pocket.

Draco helped to steady him even though his own eyes were wide and  nearly   stunned from the feeling. It was unlike the effect Dobby had  used,   though still near enough for him to have gotten used to. It  seemed Harry   had no such stomach or fortitude for that method of  travel.

Lucius and Narcissa helped prod them along and through the stone  barrier  onto Platform 9 3/4ers a few moments later, where several other  earlier  arrivals were standing around chatting.

""Now, Mister Potter, I believe that there is but one further thing in   which you must acquire."" Lucius stated calmly, calling out for the   semi-useless house-elf a few moments later.

Dobby appeared instantly,   bowing and kissing the hem of his masters robes, nearly to the disgust   of said wizard if the sneer on his face was much to go by.

""Take this sack of gold and select two of the finest Owls in Diagon   Alley for purchase. I expect it to take no more than fifteen minutes-   and ensure you acquire the other items required for proper care and   ownership. Go!"" He ordered after drawing out the same small red velvet   sack of Galleons and Sickles that Draco had used at Madam Malkins a   month  prior.

Hesitantly Dobby reached up to accept the gold and silver before  sparing  the two boys a quick glance and vanishing far more quietly now  than  before. Harry watched the creature go with a feeling of pity.

""Seeing as we are very nearly upon the train and toward Hogwarts  itself,  I trust that you two may entertain yourselves enough to pass  the  remaining time easily. Before much longer the rest of them will  arrive,  and I unfortunately have a job to perform- your mother shall  convey all  the sympathy and such necessary for the both of us. Good  luck, Draco,  Mister Potter."" Lucius told them simply and rested a hand  on either of  their shoulders for a moment, lingering more upon his own  childs before  disapparating just as quietly as Dobby had managed.

Harry felt heat rushing into his face at the touch and partial-kindness   of the act, and he smiled without realizing it. ""Well, come on then,   Potter, lets find somewhere to duel and make sure we can show the other   brats a thing or two,"" he said confidently, completely at ease now and   not nervous in the slightest about performing even more  technically-illegal magic at that point.

Harry nodded a little bemusedly and trotted after him as Narcissa   conjured a seat all to herself and drew an envelope from her pockets to   peruse again.

A short time later and things began to pick up quickly.

Dobby delivered a  magnificent black eagle-owl whose name was to be  decided by Draco,  along with its gilded golden cage and the finest owl  treats available,  while a slightly less majestic tawny and black dotted  owl looking rather  like a transfigured leopard sat within a paler  white cage for Harry  himself.

""M-masters owls, Ma'am,"" the house elf told Narcissa quietly and set  the  cages down. She barely looked up"
"Hermione slammed her heavy satchel down on the bed, scattering schoolbooks and rumpling the freshly pressed sheets.  How could she just leave like that?  They had the whole afternoon planned.  She knew how much time Hermione had put into revising for her NEWTS, she knew they needed to spend some time alone, lost in thoughts of only each other, but she had gone anyway leaving Hermione alone with only her books again.

Damn Ron for needing to talk to her NOW!  Hermione wondered what kind of Weasley emergency he had conjured up this time.  Ron was having a difficult time with his sister’s sudden interest in his best friend, and he would stoop to almost any length to keep them from spending any time alone.  Hermione was beginning to get quite annoyed, but Ginny hadn’t even seemed to notice.

“Mum’s having a crisis over Fred and George’s latest antics Hermione, I have to go this time,"" Ginny had pleaded as she sat across from her girlfriend in the library.  “I can’t always leave Ron to deal with it, especially where Mum is concerned.""

Hermione pushed the books off the bed onto the floor as she remembered the conversation.  She didn’t usually treat her things so poorly, but right this minute she was not in the mood to be tidy.  Running her fingers through her wild curls, she sighed and lay back onto her soft pillow.  The sun shone through the window of the Gryffindor dormitory reminding her of the picnic they had planned by the forbidden forest. 

Her eyes fluttered closed and she smiled at the thought of Ginny laying beside her on one of Mrs. Weasley’s handmade patchwork quilts and she couldn’t stay angry with her.  The wind would tousle her soft red hair, the sun making her freckles even more prominent.  A soft sigh escaped Hermione’s lips as she imagined their tentative kisses and hesitant touches.    Everything still felt a little new to them, their relationship barely four weeks old, and both girls still marveled how those light caresses, and softly mumbled sentiments could quicken their heartbeats and leave them breathless so fast.

Without realizing it, Hermione’s hand had left her side and moved lightly across the front of her jumper causing her to jerk slightly as it brushed her nipple.  Warmth rushed through her body as she remembered the red haired girl’s feather soft fingers in the same place.  Her body’s reaction surprised her a little, but not enough to make her move her hand away. 

Ginny often took the lead in their lovemaking, and Hermione was happy to let the younger girl control things a little.  She thought about that now as she could almost feel Ginny’s silky tongue circling her obviously erect nipples, causing her to moan softly and her breath to quicken. 

Almost on their own accord, her fingers traveled slowly down to the waistband of her skirt as the heat of her body became more intense and she could feel the wetness begin to build between her thighs.  “Mmmm Ginny,"" she mumbled as her hand moved under her skirt and brushed just lightly over her cotton pants.  She could feel the dampness there and it surprised and excited her.

Hermione imagined Ginny’s long fingers lazily pulling back the soft material and sliding quickly inside.  Her own hand mimicked her thoughts, and the touch caused a jolt of raw feeling to pulse through the young girl’s body.  Giving no thought to the fact that someone could come strolling in at any moment; Hermione began to slowly rub her fingers over the now firm nub between her legs. 

She gasped as the wetness spread around her fingers and one slid inside her, causing her to lift her hips to meet the palm of her hand.  Her breathing had become ragged and her head felt foggy, but yet her body was reacting beyond her control.  She knew her climax was not far off, and she started a rhythm with her fingers and her hips that she knew would bring her there faster. 

Suddenly she was aware of hurried breathing in the room that wasn’t her own.  Was someone there?  A moment of panic washed over Hermione as she realized she was being watched, and that she was too close to orgasm to stop what she was doing.  Her eyes opened slowly, and she glanced over to the doorway of the girl’s dormitory.  What she saw made her breath catch in her throat, and her muscles contract around her fingers, bringing her to immediate climax. 

Ginny Weasley leaned against the doorway and moaned softly as her own passion overcame her, moving her fingers quickly under her grey skirt and keeping her eyes fixed directly on Hermione’s gaze.  Neither girl could break eye contact as together their breathing began to slowly regain its usual rhythm.

“I’m guessing you missed me,"" Ginny said softly, a silly grin widening across her rosy freckled face."
"for Remus. His pallor hadn't gotten any better since school, though Remus supposed he was older and stronger and covered in a bloody lot more scars than he'd been then. That could've applied to the both of them.

They were both marked, one way or another. ""It is fortunately a very simple ritual,"" he said using a quill to scratch in a combination of Ancient runes into the soft tallow. ""But it is best to keep questions as simple as you can. You can ask what you wish once we begin, as long as you can stand the wax upon you. Would you believe Muggles try this by dropping it into water?""

""All they're divining is the fate of the water's source. Useful, I suppose, if one is very concerned about water."" He was watching, at least, some mild interest now that Remus as at work on it.

""A sanitized version of when they used to drop it into bowls of blood,"" Remus said as he finished the runes. ""There, that should do it.""

No doubt Severus was surprised he knew about such Dark magic, but he had more than a passing acquaintance. ""Are you ready?""

""Yes."" As he would ever be, and he was ready, waiting for Remus to crouch own closer, no doubt, and light the candle before he asked his question.

""Remember, the longer you can stand the wax dripping on you, the more powerful the divination will be, the more details and accuracy,"" Remus replied looking seriously at Snape. He chose to kneel then and with a flick of his wand, lit the candle, to channel magic within it and hold the flow of his own magic pouring into the candle. He muttered the spell's incantations under his breath, which he always suspected was just a ploy to make sure the wax had started melting properly and then held it over Snape’s chest.

White on white skin the first drop fell, splashing on the skin before becoming more opaque. It did not completely set, but instead flowed into the drop that joined it.

He watched Snape flinch, watching the wax fall on his chest, waiting for a few more splashes before he asked anything. ""Are my loyalties still trusted by the Dark Lord?""

The wax swirled on skin, still hot and fluid and Remus could only imagine what it must feel like as it shaped and sought the truth from bare skin to bare soul. It flowed first into the shape of spider what walked its hot wax body down the curve of the potion master’s abdomen. ""The spider -- spinning a trap with suspicion."" Not a complete answer and the wax dripped again swelling the hot wax pool each time it dropped.

The man inhaled. ""Does whatever is left of Tom Riddle still believe I serve him?"" That was a strange question, a strange wording, but important to the man, as far as Remus could tell.

The spider flowed hot wax into a long thin snake that turned and crawled back up to Snape’s chest. It slithered around his nipple flicking a tongue of stinging wax to lap at them before coiling over jealously over his heart, a trail of livid scalded skin behind it. ""The snake believes a heart is his, a service won through sensual gifts and secret moments.""

Remus felt his own face grow hot. He started to consider what that might actually mean and had to struggle to retain the divinatory magic flow.

""Does whatever is left of Tom Riddle believe I would betray him?"" Not could, no, because Remus was willing to believe that Snape could strangle his own mother one handed while reading a newspaper, but he also found it dubious and somewhat unlikely, even with the capacity. He shifted his footing, and more wax dropped, adding to the fluid heat that was the snake.

The wax had to burn; he could see the red trails on the pale white skin as the snake coiled and moved again. It raised up, the wax flaring into a hooded cobra in attack posture, even as the next stream of wax, surely painful, flowed into the shape of a dragon that seemed to try and usurp that place over Snape's heart. ""The snake believes his rightful place over your heart is shared or usurped by the dragon. A stolen heart could lead to betrayal.""

""Oh, bloody hell."" Snape closed his eyes tightly, and then exhaled raggedly. Remus was expecting him to ask him to stop, but he didn't. ""Now if only I knew what the dragon was supposed to symbolize.""

To Remus's surprise, the wax flowed suddenly down to Severus's navel and a second smaller dragon bubbled up out of the magically fluid hot wax. ""The dragon has young."" Remus watched as it rather alarmingly disappeared downwards out of his immediate sight. ""You have protected the young dragon.""

It had to be Malfoy.

Snape jerked a little, and Circe knew where that wax had gone. His thoughts about it twining and slithering in burning heat around Snape’s cock brought a flush to his cheeks.

"""
"Order’s Golden Boy aside, Draco still felt like an outsider amongst his new companions. After his father broke out of Azkaban the previous summer, his mother had disappeared and he hadn’t heard from either of them since. Draco assumed his parents, or at least his father, were fully involved in the strategy planning the Order was following through well-placed spies, but he didn’t know anything more than that and really didn’t want to.

Draco’s anger at being forgotten, and at not being as important as the Dark Lord’s cause sent him running to Professor Snape with promises to do whatever he could to help bring Voldemort down. The Potions Master had been sceptical at first, not quite understanding what brought about Draco’s sudden change of reasoning, but with time and many late-night conversations Draco’s allegiance had become understood and accepted.

So here he was, housed at Order headquarters with people who he’d never considered friends, listening outside the door to their private conversations. Not quite the best way to get off on the right foot.

When he heard the chairs scrape against the kitchen floor, Draco jumped, startled from his thoughts, Not wanting to have to explain his indiscretion, he tiptoed back upstairs, his mind swirling with information.

 

~*~*~

 

Harry went about his nightly routine quietly as not to wake Ron who was snoring loudly in the small bed across the room. His earlier conversation with Remus played heavily on his mind as he climbed into bed and pulled the cotton sheets up to his chin. He lay there for some time, his thoughts preventing him from sleeping as they often did.

After tossing and turning for what seemed like hours, Harry sat up and swung his legs over the side of the bed. He needed to talk to Draco.

The two boys had an unconventional friendship, if you could even call it that. Harry couldn’t explain it really. Draco understood him, and wasn’t afraid to tell him what was really on his mind.

When things were confusing, or damn right awful, Hermione and Ron were almost too smothering with their good intentions and careful words. Draco wasn’t like that. He was the first to tell Harry if he thought he was being a git, or if he was angry for no good reason. It was refreshing, if not a little humbling on occasion. He could always count on Draco to tell him the truth.

Harry thought they had made great strides from enemies to friends, but not everyone else felt the same. Most of the order had a difficult time accepting Draco, but for some reason Harry trusted the other boy, and needed him in an odd way.

Sometimes Harry wondered if there was a little more to it; a snippet of something he couldn’t quite explain. Some of the things Draco said, some of the comfort he provided made Harry wonder just what Draco really did think about him. Generally he brushed it off, not wanting to think too much about things he didn’t really understand.

Toeing his feet into a pair of too-big slippers, Harry padded out the door and down the corridor to Draco’s room.

 

~*~*~

 

Harry knocked tentatively at Draco’s bedroom door. Although the boys talked often, Harry still worried about interrupting Draco or getting in the way. Draco called for him to come in, so he opened the door and glanced around the immaculate room. Harry was always amazed at how tidy Draco was. Harry wasn’t near as careful with his things, and since Ron wasn’t any better, their room usually looked like a bomb had gone off.

“Hope you don’t mind,” Harry asked, moving into the room and perching at the end of Draco’s bed.

Draco shook his head and kicked a few pieces of stray ribbon and a pair of scissors under the bed before he sat down beside Harry.

“What’s on your mind?”

Harry paused for a few moments to collect his muddled thoughts. Draco was always willing to listen when he needed to vent or sort things out, but he was never really sure how much Draco would really want to know.

“Remus was telling me about my parents again. I don’t know why I still let it get to me, but you know after Sirius died I really started to wonder more about what they’d been like.”

Harry lowered his eyes, the expression on his face matching the troubled tone in his voice.

“I felt the need to hang onto whatever memories Remus had to replace the ones that I can’t conjure up in my head. Sirius and Remus knew them so well and I never got the chance. When I talk to Remus, it’s like I can almost remember them, but not quite. It’s frustrating.”

Something about the pensive look in Draco’s grey eyes almost made it seem as though the other boy understood first hand what Harry was getting at and his reply was barely audible.

“Sometimes I think it’s better not to have known.”

Harry searched the blonde’s face for clues"
"she needed and made her way into the bedroom where Lavender was waiting.

""Are you ready, sweetheart?""

Lavender smiled up at the young woman she loved.

""I've been ready for five years.""

Setting down her supplies on the bedside table, Parvati walked over and took Lavender into her arms.

""I've waited so long for this,"" she whispered, and kissed Lavender softly.

Curling her fingers around Lavender's, Parvati lead the other woman to the waiting bed. Parvati had taken the time earlier to drape the bedposts in red silk. Long ornate scarves with gold embroidery and tassels surrounded the bed, and the entire room was bathed in the glow from what seemed like a million tapered gold candles.

After gently laying Lavender down on the silk sheets, Parvati began to sing softly. There was no tune really, just a melodic chant, and the candles flickered just slightly as magic began to envelop the room.

As she sang, Parvati removed Lavender's clothes, pausing inbetween each piece of clothing to kiss lips, shoulders, stomach, thighs, carefully avoiding those places she knew would make Lavendar cry out. She would get there, but not yet, not until the song was complete.

Once Lavender was completely unclothed, Parvati stood and unwrapped the gauzy silk sari that covered her own naked body and loosened her long black hair from it's golden ties. Still chanting, she reached over to the bedside table for her quill and an ornately decorated porcelain bowl.

Lavender's eyes grew wide and Parvati knew her lover was wondering what the quill and bowl were for.

""Don't worry, love,"" Parvati whispered. ""It's just Henna. I altered it a little so it's not gritty and I can apply it with my quill.""

Lavender still looked a little confused so Parvati continued her explanation.

""Henna is used to stain the skin with intricate designs. It's considered lucky, and it's an Indian tradition for brides to use it to ornament themselves before marrying. Of course I changed the properties a little so it does a little more than just that.""

Parvati smiled at her final words. Lavender was in for an amazing experience if what Parvati had spelled the Henna to do worked correctly.

Lavender visibly relaxed at Parvati's words, so Parvati dipped the quill lightly into the bowl and paused to let any excess Henna drip back down the sides. Starting at the left side of Lavender's long neck, Parvati began to draw. The quill dipped and danced in circles over Lavender's skin as Parvati worked her way down over the blonde woman's round breasts. Lavender let out an audible sigh as the quill circled her nipples, leaving a reddish-brown spiral in it's wake.

Continuing down across Lavender's flat stomach, Parvati twirled the quill and chanted, covering Lavender's body in ornate designs stopping momentarily, just short of the mound of soft blonde curls between Lavender's thighs.

Lavender's moans were becoming louder and more frequent. Parvati knew the spell was beginning to take affect. She sang as she worked, gently caressing the top of the quill over Lavender's thighs and knees, down to the curve of her ankles. The last few words of the chant were the most important, and Parvati's voice rose in octave as finished the last of the designs ending just before the pink toenails on Lavender's tiny feet.

Reaching for her wand, Parvati whispered the final spell, causing the Henna trail to glow in the candlelight. She knew that as the Henna burned painlessly into Lavender's skin, every nerve ending in the other woman's body would be on fire. Within moments, Lavender was arching her hips calling out Parvati's name in breathless gasps. Parvati could feel her own body responding to the spell and the sight as the identical pattern she had just painstakingly created on Lavender's body replicated itself on her own.

Gazing down into her lover's eyes, Parvati could see the heavy-lidded passion and knew she couldn't wait any longer. Kneeling over Lavender's thighs, Parvati quickly thrust two dark fingers into Lavender's hot entrance and began to move. The wet heat travelled straight to Parvati's own core and she heard herself cry out with the intensity of the spell.

Lavender's orgasm was almost immediate and watching her sent a stream of shivers straight down Parvati's spine. Parvati carefully lifted herself over to Lavender's side and caressed Lavender's hair as her lover came down from her orgasmic high.

""You look incredible,"" Parvati whispered, taking in the glorious sight in front of her. Lavender's body was bathed in golden light which reflected the intricate patterns on her pale skin.

Lavender smiled softly.

""That was amazing, love.""

Parvati leaned in to kiss Lavender gently, but her own release was still imminent causing the kisses to become heated and urgent. She soon found herself pressing insistently against Lavender's thigh, the friction setting off thrills of pleasure through her dark skin, the spell giving every movement even more intensity"
