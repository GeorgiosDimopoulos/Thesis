   Subject: J2) What journals have regular articles on tropical cyclones? 
The American Meteorological Society publishes the Monthly Weather Review which has annual summaries of Atlantic basin tropical cyclones, Atlantic basin tropical disturbances, and Northeast Pacific (east of 140W) basin tropical cyclones. These summaries have a substantial amount of data and analysis of the storms.
Weatherwise prints annual summaries of both the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific basins which are less technical than the Monthly Weather Review articles, but come out months earlier.
For just the tropical cyclones of the Southeast Indian/Australia and the Australia/Southwest Pacific basins, the Australia Meteorological Magazine has a very thorough annual summary.
The Indian journal Mausam carries an annual summary of tropical cyclone activity over the North Indian Ocean. Mariner's Weather Log has articles from all of the global basins in annual summaries. These are descriptive and non-technical. Back to Historical Information Page | Back to Main FAQ Page
