Last weekend I went sailing with Davina and a handful of her friends from Port Moody. We stopped at Krispy Kreme on the way which was a first for both Nicole and Michelle, picking up doughnuts and sailing hats. We met the others down at the Marketplace in Point Roberts before heading to the marina and loading up the boat.
We sailed out from the marina, and Lyle (the owner of the boat) asked if I wouldn't mind taking the wheel. I happily obliged and we headed across the Strait of Georgia about 10km towards Saturna Island. It was a beautiful day for boating, unfortunately there was minimal wind, so we used the motor most of the way across. Just before Saturna, there is a small marine provincial park called Cabbage Island which was our final destination, so we dropped anchor.
After taking a walk around the island and most people having a quick swim, we went back to the boat for some beers while the chicken cooked on the barbecue. Michelle mentioned that she used to be a vegetarian, but then one day she realized that she loved bacon and went from vegetarian to flexitarian, I thought this was awesome because you don't often hear about people converting back. But personally I think it is a step in the right direction for her, because honestly, who wants to share eating habits with Hitler? *smirk*
Genocide... the vegetarians choice.
After that we headed back towards the mainland, and the wind picked up so we were able to sail for a while. On the whole it was a really good day, many thanks to Roz for the invite and Lyle for the use of his boat.

It's still under development, but you may have noticed the new weather feature in the top right. It queries Environment Canada's Weather Office and parses out the real-time conditions and temperature (plus any other data I want) for Vancouver, BC. The condition and temperature are hyperlinked to the 5 day forecast and I can tell you that this upcoming week is looking sweet. I added an icon display based on the condition, and in the next few days I'll make either a sun or moon display based on the time the sun sets for that day.
Wow... nerd alert.

The Jason Mraz show was amazing! When we arrived, we were escorted into an elevator and taken to our original seats which were incredible. The whole floor section was full, and we were the ONLY people above the floor level in the whole place... our private balcony had become a private floor.
A Hawaiian solo artists named Makana was on when we arrived, and played quite the energetic set. Next up was Raul Midon, another acoustic solo artist from New Mexico. A former first backup singer for Marc Anthony, Enrique Iglesias and Shakira, Raul decided to embark on a solo career. His technique was unbelievable, making it sound like he had a full band with him... and on top of this he's blind.
During the intermission, Davina and I went downstairs (to mingle with the common folk *smirk*) and bought some merch including Raul's live CD, which he signed for me. Then Mraz came on and his set blew my mind... the guy sounds better live than he does on his CD. He played a great length set, inviting both his opening acts back on stage with him for his final two songs. His dialogue between songs was fun, the way I remember John Mayer being when I saw him at Richard's on Richards.
After an exceptional acapella version of "Curbside Prophet", Mraz came down to the front of the stage and hung out with everyone, signing autographs and getting pictures taken. Totally a class act in my opinion, and I would see him again any time. Both Davina and I emailed Julie from Ticketmaster thanking her for making it a truly memorable evening.

***UPDATE***
I hadn't heard back from anyone at either Ticketmaster or the House of Blues promotions department today, so I called the Vice President of Ticketmaster Canada, Julie Soares. She was very helpful, and told me I could fax/email a copy of my complaint directly to her.
I sent the same complaint that I posted here to her via both channels. Within five minutes I got a call on my cell from Julie. She said that she had spoken to the promoter and that they were going to allow us to keep our original seats. It was as easy as that, and even accomplished with a sweet tone care of Julie.
***/UPDATE***
The Jason Mraz show is tomorrow and I got Davina and I front row private balcony seats for the show last month when they first went on sale. Today I got a call from Ticketmaster customer service informing me that the promoter closed off all the balcony (including private) seats, and that our seats would need to be reassigned. The day before the fricking show they decide this, so I lost it on the Ticketmaster customer service manager and filed the following complaint. I guess the next step is going to the BBB, luckily Ticketmaster is a registered company with them so I'll hopefully get some compensation. *sigh*
To whom it may concern,
On May 6th, 2004, I purchased two front row balcony seats (Section 1) to the Jason Mraz concert at the Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver, BC. I specifically chose these seats because my girlfriend is 5.0" tall, and can not see the show with taller people obstructing her view. At the time of my purchase, I had the option to pick floor seats only a couple of rows back, however for her benefit I picked the front row Dress Circle private balcony directly over the stage. The concert was scheduled for June 10th, 2004, which happens to be tomorrow.
At 1:46PM this afternoon (June 9th, 2004) I received a call from Veronica at Ticketmaster Canada informing me that my tickets were no longer valid because the Dress Circle and Balcony levels were being closed. I was then told that I had to choose between either Row G (7 rows back) on the right hand side, or Row O (15 rows back) if we wanted to be in the center section. On top of this, I was told that there would be no refunds regardless of whether we wanted to be reseated.
I left a message for Elaine, the Customer Services manager at Ticketmaster and when she finally called me back, she simply reiterated what I had already been told. She told me that she had spoken to many people about the changes, and that I was the only one who had expressed frustration. In order for calls to be coming through to the manager, I can't imagine that any of them were positive.
I have been a long time Ticketmaster customer, and to see this level of customer service both baffles and angers me. I trusted that my purchase was secure and would be of the quality that I envisioned. To receive a telephone call the day before the event, TELLING me that I was being reseated with no option of a refund despite my circumstances is totally unacceptable. On top of this, to be seated behind people that purchased tickets after me, at a vantage point that will hinder both my girlfriend and myself from enjoying the show to the level that we would have in our expected seats.
I trust that Ticketmaster and/or the promoter of the show will take the appropriate steps to rectify this problem. I expect to be contacted by telephone once an appropriate plan of compensation has been established. As the concert is only 24 hours away, I hope that we can come to a resolution before then.

With gas prices on the rise, Darrell needed a way to supplement his income in order to feed his bottomless pit. So he started a progressive techno band with 'Tiny', and they'll be opening for the Right Said Fred reunion tour.
Cause he's too sexy in those shades... way to hold that keyboard tiger, don't forget where you came from when you get crazy famous.

I have two very exciting announcments to make...
First off, we celebrated my best buddy Darrell's birthday last weekend. A very happy birthday to him, we had a really good time at the Murrayville Pub and laying sod the next morning at Josh's house. *shudder*
Second, on the same day, half way around the planet another good friend Brad tied the knot with his very special lady Rachael. I hope the day was memorable and wonderful for the both of you, I wish I could have been there so much.

The other night I went to see Muse at the Commodore downtown. Originally the show was scheduled to be played at Richard's on Richards, but they upgraded the venue and kept the original price of... $12.50!
Naturally I couldn't believe this, as I have paid more than this for cover to see my friends bands at local pubs around town. $12.50 for the same band that will be headlining the Glastonbury Festival in the UK this summer to over 100,000 people... bloody unbelievable.
I went down with my buddies Tim and Jay, and we met their cousins Brad and Jordan, and their girlfriends in line. Unfortunately all of us had purchased our tickets earlier except Tim who had just found out that day, so he waited in the ticket line while we went inside. Even though the show was technically sold out, they ended up letting enough of the ticket lineup inside to include Tim.
The Exit opened and they had a pretty cool reggae-rock sound. I'm not a huge fan of reggae which surprised me that I liked their set, but overall they had a good sound. Near the end of their set we moved up through the crowd, closer to the stage, and waited for Muse to come on.
Once the show started, I maneuvered my way to the front and had a great vantage point for the whole show. The boys from Muse proceeded to put on one of the best shows I've ever seen live. I love when a band can play as well or better than the tracks on their CD's, and Muse is one of these bands. They were crazy tight acoustically and their energy level was high, which led to the entire drum set being trashed and Matt throwing down his Marshall cabinet and playing the last song standing atop of it.
In the end I got myself a setlist as memento of a show, the likes of which I'll probably never see again. It's like the time I saw John Mayer at Dick's on Dicks in front of less than 200 people. After the show, I ran into Ryan and Andrew from in medias res and talked to them for a while before heading home soaked and smiling.

In typical fashion, as soon as I started updating the site again, it crashed on me. Not sure what caused it to go down, but the important thing is that we're back in business. One of the probable causes was that Blogger completely revamped their site/functionality. The new look is great, and I have yet to try out the new features. 
In other Google related news, I got myself a Gmail beta tester account. For those of you who haven't heard, Gmail is Google's new web based email service... like Hotmail. However, instead of getting 2MB of space to store your messages like on Hotmail, you get 1GB. That's right, 500x the size... all free. Unfortunatly for the rest of you, it's only in beta testing phase so you can't sign up just yet, but keep your eyes open.

The drought has ended...
My sincere apologies for the downtime over the last couple months, and the fact that you had to see the hypnotizing rump shaking of William Hung every time you visited the site. I hope to woo all of you back to the longwinded stories that make up this simple life I lead. A big thank you to all the people who encouraged me to get back into the swing of things, and for putting up with my lack of updates... you guys are radical.
I have many new life updates since I have spoken to many of you, and I'll try to cover all of them over the next couple weeks, so stay tuned... I'm not jerking your chain... scouts honour.

William Hung
Apparently I'm the only person in the world who hasn't heard about William Hung, a civil engineering student from UC Berkeley. With the third round of American Idol underway, William decided to follow his dreams to become an entertainment phenom. His audition video basically explains it all... but instead of becoming one of the countless other "no talent ass clowns", he has become a pop culture icon. He has fan sites popping up on the net, TV and radio interviews, and was even given $25,000 and a recording contract with Kosh Entertainment.
On top of this, he has even been impersonated by Jimmy Fallon on SNL and has more DJ remixes of his performances than you could fit on a CD. Tim Bergeron, a UC Berkeley student, got some first hand shots of William's live performance at the UCB Volleyball game, and even took this great shot of some local Hung graffiti.

Hacking stuff is cool... my friend Catherine (Pictures courtesy of Meg) lives vicariously through my past as a l33t hax0r. Yesterday my friend Liz had her MSN account taken over by someone, and they subsequently started chatting up people on her contact list through Messenger. The following conversation was what ensued...

Lauren's MSN name was "So bored it hurts", so I tried to ease her pain with Kickups. She sent me back a link to Abominable Snowman Penguin Baseball. I recorded my best score below... lets see if it can be beat.

Here's a trip back... circa 1993 when the CBC reported on this new thing called "Internet".
...They're sharing scientific data, arguing philosophy, or passing on cooking tips and gossip. Night and day through a computer network called "Internet".
...You need a computer and a phone, and suddenly you're part of a new mesh of people, programs, archives, ideas.
...There's an interesting sort of restraint that you find, there's not a lot of cursing or swearing, there's not a lot of personal cuts, there's not a lot of put downs that one would expect to find... there's not screenfulls of "go to hell".
...The thing that I am always left with when I leave, is this overwhelming desire for people to be rooted. And the only way that they feel rooted, is through another person. (My Australian friends should love this one... its a minute and a bit in)
..."That's great" reads the same as "That's great" on Internet.
...It has more soul than any human being I know!
...The internet is growing like an embryonic brain.

Darrell found a metal pole in the storage room here at work and has been swinging it around like some sort of ninja. I kept telling him that he was going to hurt someone, but he just threatened to beat me down if I didn't capture his moves on film.
Alas... I complied.
