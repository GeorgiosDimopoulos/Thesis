" ... as I watched Jerry suffer the aches and pains, the nausea, the chills, the whole horrible experience came rushing back to me. In that moment I hated heroin more than ever, because it was destroying someone I cared so much about, someone who had such a good heart and so much to offer the world." - Steve Parish, in "Home Before Daylight".
