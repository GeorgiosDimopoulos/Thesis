Hi,
I'm Frank Davies.
I have enjoyed making art since I was very young.
(That is me in the background back in 1970,
...throwing pottery off the lump while in high school.)
I have a few other interests which have also developed over time,
...music, science, mathematics, manufactureing, and logic in general.
