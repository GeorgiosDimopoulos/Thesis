HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA ALERT

RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR?
RESOURCES FOR THE OCTOBER 7TH BALLOT

RECALL ELECTION:
With 135 candidates running for Governor, health advocates should be
aggressive in asking candidates what their positions on relevant health care
issues.

For organizations that will be communicating with those running, ATTACHED is
a Health Access California one-page sheet of questions on health policy that
all candidates for Governor should answer on pending health care issues, on
the subject of the budget crisis, expanding health coverage, consumer and
cost protections, and pending initiatives that impact health.

PROPOSITION 54:
Last week, Health Access California re-affirmed its position to strongly
OPPOSE Proposition 54, Ward Connerly's Information Ban, which would prohibit
state and local governments, public universities, and school districts from
collecting or using information about race, ethnicity, color or national
origin. Despite an ineffective "health exemption," the initiative would
hamper efforts to improve health and reduce the risk of disease in
California. We urge all organizations that care about health care to join
the opposition to this destructive initiative.

On the opposition to Prop 54, more information is available at:
www.informedcalifornia.org. Also ATTACHED is a one-page fact sheet prepared
for health advocates by the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network (CPEHN).
The California HealthCare Foundation has developed a independent web page,
at http://www.chcf.org/topics/view.cfm?itemid=21253, which has links to
resources in support and opposition.

PROPOSITION 53:
Also last week, the board of Health Access California voted to OPPOSE
Proposition 53, which would dedicate a percentage of the state's general
fund to infrastructure projects. This would simply further put a budget
squeeze on other areas, including health care and other vital services.

The California Budget Project has published a detailed, independent look at
the impact of Proposition 53, available at:
http://www.cbp.org/2003/bb030813Prop53.pdf. (The CBP website also has a
similarly useful brief on Prop 54, as well.)

BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY ACT:
While much of the recall effort was fueled by discontent about the budget,
the result of the recall is most likely not going to improve the budget
situation. The problem has been the process, not any one personality. The
current budget process allows all players to escape accountability, and
fosters the kind of gridlock that we have witnessed the past two years.

Slated not for this ballot but for March 2004, the Budget Accountability Act
would reform the budget process to encourage timely and responsible budgets,
and would provide the real change that many might be seeking in the current
recall. In one of the fastest signature-gathering operations in state
history, the campaign to place the Budget Accountability Act on the ballot
has collected over 800,000 signatures. We are collecting any last voluteer
signatures collected: please submit them ASAP to Californians for Budget
Accountability, 1510 J Street, Suite 210, Sacramento, CA 95814. With any
question, call 916-443-7817 or the web site at
http://www.budgetaccountabilitynow.org/
