My research interests center around language, knowledge representation, inference and planning. These interests are tied together by the general goal of developing agents with common sense and the ability to converse and acquire knowledge through language. Some specific topics my students and I have worked on include 

* very expressive, language-like logics to capture the content of ordinary language and commonsense reasoning as directly as possible; the most recent is called Episodic Logic; 
* semantics of events/situations, tense/aspect, reference, affixes, mass terms, generic sentences, belief, questions, vagueness; 
* efficient, specialized inference techniques for taxonomies, part-structure, temporal relations, and other classes of relations that pervade commonsense knowledge and are handled effortlessly by people; 
* methods of organizing knowledge and inference so that a general-purpose reasoner will easily locate knowledge relevant to a particular task (even for a very large knowledge base), and will smoothly integrate general and specialized inference techniques; 
* strategies for human-like, error-tolerant natural language parsing and disambiguation, and for mapping syntactic structure to a representation of the underlying meaning (allowing for context); 
* development of implementations of the above knowledge representations and inference techniques; the latest is called EPILOG, and supports the Episodic Logic knowledge representation and integrates general and specialized inference mechanisms; 
* Deriving general world knowledge from texts and taxonomies, as an attack on the "knowledge acquisition bottleneck" in AI; 
* reasoning about plans and actions, in support of both language understanding (e.g., conversation planning and inferring the goals and plans of story characters) and domain reasoning (e.g., formulating plans of action in a transportation domain); automatically discovering invariants in planning domains -- see the DISCOPLAN system; solving the Frame Problem using "explanation closure".
