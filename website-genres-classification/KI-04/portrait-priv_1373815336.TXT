The page that was here was not very good, so I have taken it down until I get time to design a page that I am happy with. In the meantime you could look at DUHAC's webpage, which I maintain at the moment and which is vastly superior to this.

My CV is only slightly out of date.

Eldorado

    Gaily bedight,
    A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
    Had journeyed long,
    Singing a song,
In search of Eldorado. 

    But he grew old-
    This knight so bold-
And o'er his heart a shadow
    Fell as he found
    No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado. 

    And, as his strength
    Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow-
    "Shadow," said he,
    "Where can it be-
This land of Eldorado?" 

    "Over the Mountains
    Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the Shadow,
    Ride, boldly ride,"
    The shade replied-
"If you seek for Eldorado!" 

--Edgar Allan Poe
