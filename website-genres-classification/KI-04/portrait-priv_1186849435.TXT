Current Whereabouts

As of September 1, 2000, I took a leave of absence from MIT to become a founding faculty member of the brand new Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts. 
Effective 1 July, 2001, that move is permanent. Although my MIT coordinates do continue to reach me, it is substantially more efficient to contact me there directly:
