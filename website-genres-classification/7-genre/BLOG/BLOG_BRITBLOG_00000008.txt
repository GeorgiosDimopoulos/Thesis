NOTES ON EXILE BY A MAN IN A ROOM IN A FLAT ON HIS OWN
Monday, March 07, 2005
almost a half-life later 
Jodie and I were seeing each other (on & off &amp; on & off) for roughly seven months a few years ago. We met outside the post office on Russell Square one January evening. He dropped an envelope, which landed by my feet. A shy, almost timid, Thank you for picking that up turned into a conversation, a drink, an exchange of phone numbers and emails and a Proper Date the following weekend. Jodie was one of those inspired students. He lived in the zillions of books he had to read for his politics degree, his thoughts heavy with the Black Man’s struggle. He even went the whole nine yards and read stuff his professor dared not recommend. We would sit for hours mulling over something a certain writer had said in a book or an article, comparing it against something somebody else had said somewhere else, weighing them against what we thought, finding them both defective and moving on to the next exploding star. It was his complete disregard for what anyone thought of him that I found so utterly compelling. Once I was watching him from across the road as he waited for me to arrive at an appointed rendezvous, completely absorbed in a novel. Suddenly he burst out laughing, making total strangers jump in shock. I remember smiling at how he makes me follow him because the only ones I have ever been attracted to are the ones who don’t care.August 2001. It was almost time to pack my bags, to collect my passport from the Syrian Embassy and to beg a lift to Heathrow. And Jodie was refusing to meet up with me. Three days to go and I called him one evening as I walked passed that same post office. I got his voicemail instead. ‘I’m going in a couple of days,’ I must have said. ‘I haven’t seen you in a week. Don’t you want to say goodbye?’He called back at the wrong time. When I got out of the tube at the other end of my journey, his voicemail was waiting for me. ‘Hi. I don’t think it’ll be good for me to see you. I mean, a year is a long time.’ I can laugh at it now. I can understand why he did it. I can even thank him for it. But at the time his way of doing things filled me with selfish rage, which eventually subsided when I got to Damascus. By then, I was filled with an immense longing to be with him again.Last week. Three years later. This is what happened —I was on the bus coming home from work and Nadia called sounding as urgent as ever. ‘I’m in Covent Garden,’ she said, getting straight to the point, ignoring the fact that we hadn’t seen each other for months. ‘You’ll never guess what happened today. I’ve been trying to get through to you all afternoon but your phone’s been off. Come and meet me and I’ll tell you.’ I said, ‘I’m actually busy this evening.’ But she wouldn’t take no for an answer so off I trundled to a dimly-lit cocktail bar on Earlham Street. After the usual pleasantries, she started moaning about the time it had taken me to get there. Finally she said, ‘I was in Brixton today and guess who I bumped into outside the station?’Oh the endless possibilities, I thought but said nothing.‘Jodie,’ she said. ‘Well not Jodie. I mean he’s not called Jodie anymore.’‘Huh?’‘Jodie. Black guy. The intense one. LSE? Remember?’‘Yes…’‘His name’s Ali now.’‘Ali? You mean…’‘Yes! He recognised me. He doesn’t have that hair anymore. He’s got a beard. Can you believe it?’So there it was. Jodie. Muslim. Jodie! All those things we did together, I thought. In bedrooms. In cars. On crowded trains. The upper decks of empty buses. The great outdoors. Anywhere and everywhere. Without limits. Jodie!Then she told me how it had happened. I should really have expected it all along. Towards the end of what I call our relationship, he’d often ask me about my experience of religion, what had drawn me to it, what had taken me away. If I tried to change the subject, he’d refuse to speak to me for hours. When I’d finally relent, he’d listen with this intense look in his eyes. Then he’d go off and make himself a cup of coffee still deep in thought, sometimes forgetting to add sugar and sometimes adding too much. One day he said, ‘I want you to lend me your books.’‘He said he converted a few months after you went to Syria. Then he went to Yemen to study Arabic.’ That makes sense, I thought. Then I felt deeply impressed. Fascinated even. Ali or Jodie. Their courage and resolve.‘He sends you his greetings by the way.’ I laughed at this. ‘He told me to thank you. He said you guys used to have discussions about Islam. He said he’s completely reformed. Not changed. Just modified his priorities or something.’‘Hmmmm.’‘And get this. He said it’s not too late for you either!’That made both of us laugh and we ordered more drinks and started talking about other things.

Free Mojtaba and Arash Day

free mojtaba and arash day set for tomorrow 
The Committee to Protect Bloggers has started a campaign to free Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad, who have both been deprived of their liberties by the Iranian government for expressing reformist opinions on their blogs. Sigarchi is still imprisoned in the Iranian city of Rashat. Saminejad has been released from prison in Tehran but still faces charges. Fellow bloggers are being called upon to do what they can to help raise awareness of the plight of bloggers in similar situations.Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that ‘everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.’ Since all member states of the UN are also signatories to the UDHR, Iran is in clear breach of this important international agreement.Bloggers everywhere have been called upon to dedicate their sites tomorrow to the campaign. The least we can do is post Free Mojtaba and Arash Day in big fat letters. This is not the first time that governments have been attempting to clamp down on bloggers. In an article for the BBC, a spokesman for Amnesty International said, ‘Just as the internet is a tool for freedom, so it is being used as an excuse for repression. Amnesty International has recorded a growing number of cases of people detained or imprisoned for disseminating their beliefs or information through the internet, in countries such as China, Syria, Vietnam, the Maldives, Cuba, Iran and Zimbabwe. It is also shocking to realise that in the communications age just expressing support for an internet activist is enough to land people in jail.’If you are in the UK, you can contact either the Permanent Representative to the United Nations or the Iranian ambassador to the UK.Sir Emyr Jones-ParryAmbassador & Permanent Representative to the UK Mission to the UNOne Dag Hammarskjold Plaza885 Second Avenue (between 47th & 48th Streets)New York, NY 10017Tel: (212) 745 9200 / Fax: (212) 745 9316Email the AmbassadorDr. Muhammad Husain AdeliEmbassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran16 Prince’s GateLondon SW7 1PTTel: (020) 7225 3000 / Fax: (020) 7589 4440Email the AmbassadorIf you are in the US, contact either the Representative at the Iranian Interest Section of the Pakistani Embassy or the Ambassador to Iran’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations.

you're slacking on your blog 
I want to apologise for the hiatus in writing. For the past fortnight I’ve been busy working on my play, which the RCT here in London has agreed to help me develop. I finished it only yesterday and spent the night partying with friends in Angel. I do love writing, but what I love more is the feeling of knowing that a project is finally complete. A big Thank You to all the people who emailed me wanting to know what was going on. Susan, I’m pretty sure your New York mornings weren’t that boring. David, I’m not sure when I will be in Paris again. Martin, thank you for your kind wishes but the idea of going up to Leeds to spank your backside with a wet fish doesn’t really do anything for me.

the morning after the night before 
If you come out of Starbucks on Blvd St-Germain (opposite the UGC cinema) and turn left, you’ll see rue de l’Odéon. Walk up this road and you’ll eventually come to a small pub with smoke-darkened walls and posters of ancient rock bands and jazz troupes. Le 10, it’s called. When you see the red door, go in. Don’t dawdle. Now that you’re inside, have a good look around. Isn’t it just how you imagined bohemian Paris to be? Adjacent to the door is the bar. If you’re a whisky man, doubles here cost only €5. Look around. Don’t be shy. What else do you see? A young crowd. Vintage jeans. Stressed leather jackets. Messy hair. If you concentrate enough, you could be back in the bar of your old university union. There’s even a juke box and someone’s put on Yves Montand, but don’t worry about that. Give yourself five minutes in here and someone else will put on Pink Floyd. You — yes, even you — could be that guy sitting at the back with the big afro playing black jack with his buddies, having a zoot and just feeling it. Keep looking. Don’t be shy. That’s what it’s all about. Eye contact. Furtive glances that turn into stares that turn into smiles and numbers and long walks to somebody’s bed. It could be you, my boy. You and that beautiful woman — yes, yes, the one with the blue eyes — playing tarot with the French dudes. You like her, don’t you? I knew you would! Now, see the guy in the black leather coat? The one with the blonde hair and designer stubble, looks like he stepped off a catwalk? That’s the guy you just lost to. If you’d been here an hour ago, you’d have seen the blue-eyed girl come in with her friend. They both went downstairs — the pub is even more bohème down there! — and sat at a small table in the corner. Sensing a not uncommon connection taking place between her friend and the cute American boy at the next table, she came upstairs to buy drinks. ‘That boy,’ she must have muttered. ‘He even scores in straight places.’ On the way to the bar the blond guy smiled at the girl and she smiled back. ‘Ca va?’ he'd asked, a little shyly. She'd said, ‘Oui. Et toi?’ That’s when you should have been here. Well, a little earlier perhaps. Just as she was coming up the stairs, you should have been standing at the top with your killer smile and that winning line you always use. Oh well, all you can do now is watch and commiserate yourself.Now buy yourself a drink, change the music on the jukebox and sit at any of the chairs at the bar. Someone is bound to talk to you. Perhaps if you smile a lot and crack a few jokes with any old someone, she’ll notice you. But she isn’t going to, is she? Poor you! Look how the blond guy smiles at her. He’s flirting now! The blue-eyed girl says something and everyone laughs — there are two other girls (not your type?) and a tall guy. And who’s that coming up the stairs now? Oh, it’s her friend and that American guy (he mentioned studying history or something at the Sorbonne). And now a who’s who of everyone and small talk. You’ll never get her now. Oh, look. The blue-eyed girl is whispering something to her friend. ‘What do you think?’ she’s asking him. Her friend steals a glance at the cute blond guy and smiles. He even nods his head.Don’t mope. It’s only 1.30. The night’s still young. Plenty more women out there. Don’t mope! It doesn’t look good. Buy yourself another drink. No. Let me buy it. This is, after all, the place to come if you’re tired of plotting the next revolution and need to conquer a lonely heart instead.Merde! They’re leaving now. I think the blond guy mentioned something about a party in a house in the country. Well isn’t that something, eh? Partying with strangers. Oh drink up, sonny. You don’t look like you were her type anyway.

etienne 
Come hither, Muse, and lay your head upon my breast and I shall tell you a beautiful tale to end this night. Hither and thither your joys and woes until, like mourning willows, my words kiss the sultry waters of your soul. Listen for the lover — how, like a purple sunset kissed by bending skies, he glances sidelong at a beloved whose love is yet undeclared! Now look out, Muse, for the crafty knave and how a love, like pure Alcestis awakened from her grave, is destroyed by jealousy and greed.Remember, Muse, that thou in I and you and them and all of us and everything on earth and in the seven heavens above or below the mighty throne of God. Cast yourself into the very depths of hell and what is below and above and beneath those undying lands past the sickening stench of death and sorrow. Remember those virgin shores, those delicate virgin shores, and smile as I stare into eyes that dare not see too much yet yearn to be kissed in the dark and surprised by sudden passions sans shame and regret. Remember, Muse, your smile and that strand of hair that falls across your brow.Now, think of Etienne and like him lose yourself in my eyes, my voice, my cottonbud lips. Lose yourself, Muse, in all of these and I will guide you back by the hand and a gentle voice — follow me, follow me and gather these rosebuds while ye may.Soft! What light through yonder window breaks? No Juliet. No moon. Only Majnoon weeping in the desert and Leila who scorns him and thereafter Etienne and I, that wanton knave. But pause now and rest awhile and kiss me, my lover, my kinsman, my own, for just a moment, an event, a discourse, a thought, the essence of a dot above or below a letter in a book. Kiss me, Muse, for it is a frown, a sigh, a deep languor, a yearning, a tryst with destiny (perhaps), a smile from Leila shot like burning arrows, a dagger stare, a daring gaze, a hand outstretched calling to me: ‘Come hither, my lover, my kinsman, my own.’ Here is a tale to tickle your loins. He saw me. He touched me. He troubled his conscience to kiss me. And lover and knave and forgotten beloved — one and two and absent three. Oh the ripped out last page of that book you loved!

où sont les beaux beurs? 
Our night began in earnest in Châtelet in central Paris. We were looking for the city’s gay district, Le Marais, and armed with the names of three bars we felt very confident. But warriors need food so we stopped off at a Jewish restaurant and ate merguez and kebabs, eyed up the pretty waiter and talked loudly about anal sex just to see who would understand. (It turned out that the middle-aged lady at the next table understood and kept looking at me with a wry smile.) That’s one of the things I love about the Senorita. You can talk about the downright sleazy and she won’t even bat an eyelid. In fact, she’ll have an opinion on it and won’t mind how graphic yours are.The first name on our hit list was a trendy lounge bar called Amnésia, so-called perhaps because by the time the barman gets round to serving you you’ve forgotten what you’d wanted. Nice décor but a very uninviting crowd and after just the one drink we decided to ask the barman where Le Cox could be found. The barman said it was closed but recommended another bar just down the road.Searching, searching, and getting lost. We were about to give up and look for the third bar on our list when we walked past the ludicrously named Feeling Café. The Senorita guffawed and said, ‘Oh, but darling, we simply must go in — maybe one of these boys will know where the beaux beurs are.’ So, urged on by the thought of meeting lovely Arab boys, we entered the badly-lit establishment. ‘Hold your nose, Smithers,’ Mr Burns was saying. ‘We’re going in.’When we entered the bar, everyone stopped what they were doing and stared at us. A tall, shifty looking Arab leapt to his feet and started a conversation with the Senorita and then asked to be introduced to me. When we shook hands, the rascal actually tickled my palm with his little finger! We had a very brief conversation in which he asked if I was gay or straight, something that practically everyone I spoke to last night asked me. I think he realised quite quickly that I wasn’t really interested because he said his goodbyes and left us. We sat at the bar and drank two whiskeys each during which time I noticed a pretty Arab boy sitting next to me. He was a lot more endearing than the first and smiled a lot. I think the Senorita fell in love with that smile and I’m sure it was more than mutual. He told us his name was Jimmy (which I assumed was a nom de guerre), he was originally Moroccan, grew up in Berlin and had moved to Paris ten months ago. His face lit up when the Senorita told him I speak Arabic. ‘Tehki ‘arabi ente?’ he asked, almost falling out of his chair.Without thinking, I replied, ‘Oui.’ He laughed and said, ‘Shu oui oui? Hakeeni bil-‘arabi!’So we talked a lot. His Arabic was very pretty and I thanked him for using an eastern dialect for my sake because north African Arabic is so difficult to understand. Then he wanted to know my whole life story. Where had I learnt Arabic? What was I doing in the Middle East? Was I a kamikaze? How long was I going to be in Paris? At the same time, I was translating the conversation for the Senorita. That felt strange. Up until then she’d been the one to talk to strangers, to translate on my behalf and then to apologise for my not knowing French.When the Senorita left — ‘I must avail myself of the facilities, darling’ — Jimmy waited a couple of seconds and then asked: ‘Do you prefer boys or girls?’ I almost choked on my drink. I mean, bloody hell, ducks, I’m sitting in a gay bar and this boy’s asking me what I am!I looked at him out of the corner of my eye and said, ‘I get addicted to things very quickly. When I was fifteen I tried a boy and now I can’t give up. What about you?’ He said he was bisexual and I forgave him for being so greedy. Then he said: ‘Does your friend know you’re gay?’ I must have looked at him like he was mad because his face adopted an apologetic expression.I said, ‘She’s my fag hag.’He said, ‘Your what?’So I spent the next ten minutes explaining the concept of fag hag to a homosexual in Arabic. In the middle of this the Senorita returned and I felt like reinforcements had arrived at the charge of the Light Brigade. She tried to explain to him in French, but he didn’t understand. So I said: ‘It’s like this. Most gay men don’t make friends with straight guys because there’s always some kind of tension between them. We make friends with other gay men or beautiful straight women. Straight women understand us. They love us. They adore us. We can be open with them. It’s like our natures are the same.’ ‘Oh!’ he exclaimed as though he’d just discovered a flaw in Einstein’s theory of relativity. ‘You’re like brother and sister. Why didn’t you just say that?’‘No,’ I said. ‘We’re more like two sisters.’ Then I quickly added: ‘In a non-camp way.’‘Right,’ the Senorita said, setting her whisky down and changing the subject. ‘Beurs.’ After ten minutes of French, we ascertained the whereabouts of a beur club by the Pompidou Centre and set off. The night was turning into an adventure and it was only midnight.By the PC we got lost again. Forlorn, we wondered who on earth we could ask for directions when we spotted three gays walking towards us. ‘Saved,’ the Senorita muttered. ‘Excusez-moi, messieurs?’The name of the club we’d been recommended — Le Depot — turned out to be a sleazy sex joint for men only. By the time one of the guys (Grègory) had explained this to us, the other two (Alex and Frank; boyfriends for the past three years) had fallen in love with the Senorita. Grègory said, ‘We’re going to the Banana Café. It’s really nice. Why don’t you come too?’As we were walking, I noticed that the Senorita was being flanked by Alex and Frank who had their arms around her shoulders. Typical, I thought and smiled. This left me and Grègory walking together and the inevitable happened. Grègory said, ‘Are you coming too?’I pretended to be offended. ‘Not if you don’t want me to come.’He laughed and said, ‘No. I thought you were straight.’‘Mon cher,’ I replied, touching his cheek with the tips of my fingers. ‘The night’s still young. I can get a lot gayer.’The Banana Café (who chooses these names?) has no entrance fee, but the cloakroom charges €7 and I suppose this makes up for the loss. There are two levels. Upstairs is just for drinking and lounging and someone pumps out hard techno/house/dance. Downstairs is the piano bar and this is where all the dancing takes place. There is a live singer until about 3am and then the DJ takes over until the club closes at 7am.Thus began Part IV of our night out. Alex and Frank disappeared into a dark corner and spent the night kissing, dragging themselves apart only to buy drinks for the rest of us. Grègory introduced us to the rest of his friends and the Senorita whispered to me, ‘That boy likes you.’ This made me blush. Grègory is really handsome and rugged. He’s tall, has olive skin, a beautiful physique and messy brown hair. He laughs a lot and gets shy really quickly.After a couple of drinks, I started to feel the need to shake my ass on the dance floor. So the Senorita and I manoeuvred ourselves to the centre of the crowd, disgusted that these so-called Parisian sophisticates are such terrible dancers. They cannot dance to save — or lose — their souls. ‘Shake those backsides, you losers,’ I inwardly screamed. ‘It’s called booty for a reason.’We were dancing all night and I was grinding with the Senorita with one leg in the air and suddenly I turned around and Grègory was standing behind me staring down at my middle with a smile on his face. ‘Don’t stop,’ he said. ‘It looks nice.’ This made me blush even more and the Senorita whispered, ‘See? I told you.’I tried to get Grègory to grind with me, but gave up after a couple of minutes. He wanted to sit in a corner and drink whisky and talk about life. He grabbed my hand and dragged me away from the Senorita (who had by this time developed her own gaggle of admirers queuing up to dance with her). We sat in a corner, the barman brought us a bottle of whisky and Grègory told me how his parents were from Romania and how much he hated them. He had lived in London for four years (Camden, Hampstead and Kentish Town) and returned to Paris because he felt this burning desire to be back in his homeland. I was about to point out that the concept of homeland is something we invent as we wander through life, when a beautiful man came and sat down next to me. He turned out to be a close friend of Grègory’s. Paulo. An Italian actor or lawyer or something. So there we were. The three of us sitting in the semi-dark and me in the middle. Grègory telling me his life story in one ear and Paulo telling me how beautiful I am in the other. I don’t think either of them knew what exactly was going on. Just then the Senorita appeared. ‘Darling,’ she said, taking my hand. ‘You must save me. I’m being chased by a mad Mauritian.’ So up I leapt to defend the honour of a mademoiselle in distress. The wolf slunk away, dejected, its ego ripped in half.In the middle of another grinding session, these Parisian no-lifes staring at us in awe, the Senorita said, ‘I think those boys are talking about you. Grègory and your new hottie. Who is he?’ I turned around and sure enough my boys were arguing. So, I thought, a duel over me. Well, this is new. This is what I love about being here: I’m suddenly this beautiful exotic creature that two guys would actually argue over. Who’d have thought that my life would eventually take this turn? I felt quite satisfied to be honest.Too many beers later and God knows how many shots of whisky, the club was beginning to empty. We couldn’t find Alex or Frank anywhere and poor Grègory, who shares an apartment with Alex, couldn’t find his door keys. The Senorita suggested he stay over at ours, an invitation he was more than eager to accept. As we were leaving, Paulo approached me. ‘You are going?’ he asked. ‘Without me?’ I had to laugh and gave him a kiss on the cheek. ‘Have a good night, habibi,’ I said.At the door, we turned around to see where Grègory was. I caught a glimpse of him and Paulo shaking hands and making up. ‘That’s so sweet,’ the Senorita said. ‘Let’s just hope it was the best man who won the duel.’We were all so drunk by this stage. Grègory tried to kiss me in the middle of the street, in the taxi, while crossing the road, in the shop where we bought croissants. Actually, I was so drunk I started a conversation with the taxi driver in French all the way back to our apartment, something about wanting a billet simple pour Grenoble s’il vous plait. Grègory was sitting on one side of me giggling and calling me silly and the Senorita was on the other calling me mad.Back at the apartment, the Senorita said she needed a shower. I must have given her a knowing stare because she looked away and said, ‘But, sweetie, you know I always shower after a night out. Now, you boys are not to wait up for me.’The moment she left the room, Grègory was all over me like an octopus. When we were in bed, I said, ‘Paulo told me you have a boyfriend.’ Grègory let out a long sigh and rubbed his face. ‘I’m going to Brussels next week,’ he said. ‘I don’t love him anymore. So it’s finished.’‘Have you told him this?’‘No. But I think he knows.’‘Well, it can’t be over until you both say it.’ Silence. ‘Now I think we should sleep.’ This surprised and disappointed the whore in me. Grègory: ‘But I don’t want to.’‘Eh?’‘I want you to fuck me off.’‘What?’‘I want you to fuck me off.’‘You want me to fuck you off?’ Does he want me to swear at him or something, I thought.‘Yes. You must stop thinking like an English and fuck me off like a Continental.’‘I don’t think I could forgive myself if I did.’ (This infuriated the Senorita when I filled her in later. ‘Darling,’ she said. ‘I don’t want to hear about your conscience.’ But then she laughed hysterically about the idea of fucking someone off.)Grègory said, ‘If you can’t fuck me off like a Continental, I want you to fuck me off like an Indian. You know I love the Indians.’In the end we just snuggled and luckily Grègory was too drunk to argue anymore.We woke up around midday, the Senorita had gone out somewhere and Grègory started moaning about how I’d failed to fuck him off and then realised he’d missed his ‘très importante’ appointment at the hairdressers. Before he left, he gave me his number and said, ‘Call me if you want to see me again.’ Then he gave me a kiss, stroked my hair, sighed and left. ‘Poor Grègory,’ the Senorita would later say. ‘Poor, poor Grègory.’I am writing this in the café of the Institut du Monde Arabe. It is a beautiful building situated on the Left Bank of the Seine. Thousands of mouche-arabies, which are photo-electrically sensitive apertures, have been built into the building’s glass façade and remind me of the latticed windows of old Damascene houses. The Senorita is drinking espresso and smoking a cigarette. We spent a small part of the afternoon wandering around Notre-Dame, convinced that Catholicism is really another form of sado-masochism. Tonight we are meeting Etienne at the Bastille. I am terribly excited. I don’t think I will call Grègory after all.
