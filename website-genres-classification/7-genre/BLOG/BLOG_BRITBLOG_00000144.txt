Common Sayings A to Z  
This is nothing to do with Cornwall, as far as I know, but I received it in an email today. There was no indication as to it's origin or it's author. If anyone can shed light on on it please do. and if anyone wishes to amend or suppliment it please let me know.acid test - and absolute test - nitric acid was used to determined the purity of gold when it was used as currency in the days before coinage.above board - honest - a metaphor based on a conjuror preparing a trick with hands above the 'board' (table), rather than below it, where the trickery could be concealed.across the board - all - racetrack bookmakers in the USA showed the odds on boards of horses finishing places; an across-the-board bet was one which backed a horse to win or be placed in the first three.alligator - the reptile - from the Spanish, who first named it in the USA, 'el lagarto', meaning 'the lizard'.all-singing all-dancing - full of features/gimmicks - the term was first used in advertising for the 1929 musical film, the first with sound, Broadway Melody.ampersand - the name of the '&' symbol, meaning 'and' - when originally shown after the alphabet in reference books, the & was described as: 'and per se, and' meaning 'and by itself, and'.alma mater - (my) university - from the Latin, meaning 'fostering mother'.almanac - diary - either or both from the Arabic 'al manac' meaning 'the diary' and/or from Saxon term 'al-mon-aght' meaning 'all moon heed', which was the record of new and full moons.apple-pie bed - practical joke, with bed-sheets folded preventing the person from getting in - generally assumed to be derived from the apple-turnover pastry, but more likely from the French 'nappe pliee', meaning 'folded sheet'.assassin - killer - the original Assassins were Carmathian warriers based in Mount Lebanon around the eleventh century; they terrorised the middle eastern world for two hundred years, supposedly high on hashish most of the time, particularly prior to battle.take a back seat - have little or only observational involvement in something - not a car metaphor, this was originally a parliamentary expression derived from the relative low influence of persons and issues from the back benches (the bench-seats where members sit in the House of Commons), as opposed to the front benches, where the leaders of the government and opposition sit.backs to the wall - defend fiercely against a powerful threat - achieved cliche status following inclusion in an order from General Haig in 1918 urging British troops to fight until the end against German forces.baker's dozen - thirteen - in times when bakers incurred a heavy fine for giving short weight they used to add an extra loaf to avoid the risk.barbarian - rough or wild person - an early Greek and Roman term for a foreigner, meaning that they 'babbled' in a strange language.battle of the bulge - diet/lose weight - the original Battle of the Bulge occurred in 1944 when German forces broke through Allied lines into Belgium, forming a 'bulge' in the defending lines.battle lines - forces or position organised prior to confrontation or negotiation - from centuries ago when troops were organised in three lines of battle: the van, the main body and the rear.berserk - wild - from Berserker, a Norse warrier, who went into battle 'baer-serk', which meant 'bare of mail' (chain mail armour).bedlam - chaos - after the London mental institution founded originally as a religious house by Simon Fitzmary in 1247, and converted into the 'Bethlehem Hospital' for lunatics by Henry VIII. The hospital still exists as 'Bethlem Hospital' in Croydon, South London.big cheese - important person - probably from colonial India where Urdu 'chiz', meaning 'thing' was adopted by the British to mean something good.big stick - display of power - Theodore Roosevelt wrote in 1900 that he liked the West African expression 'speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far'. Kipling reinforced the expression when he wrote in 1917 that the secret of power '...is not the big stick. It's the liftable stick.'bite the bullet - do or decide to do something very difficult - before the development of anaesthetics, wounded soldiers would be given a bullet to bite while being operated on, so as not to scream with pain.bird - woman or girlfriend - now unfortunately a rather unflattering term, but it wasn't always so; until recent times 'bird' was always an endearing term for a girl, derived from the Anglo-Saxon 'brid' which meant 'baby animal', in other words a cute little thing. The origin also gave us the word 'bride'.blackball - to exclude or shun - see 'pipped at the post'.blighty - england (esp when viewed by an Englishman overseas) - from foreign service in colonial India, the Hindu word 'bilayati' meant 'foreign' or 'European'.blimey - mild expletive - from '(God) blind me!'blackmail - demand money with threat - 'mail' from Saxon 'mal' meaning 'rent', also from 'maille', an old French coin; 'black' is from the Gaelic, to cherish or protect; the term 'blackmail' was first used to describe an early form of protection money, paid in the form of rent, to protect property against plunder by vagabonds.blarney - persuasive but empty words - from the verbal procrastination tactics of Cormack MacCarthy, 1602, in holding the castle of Blarney in Ireland , near Cork, despite agreeing to hand it to the English as part of the surrender terms.blue peter - the children's TV show - the name of the flag hoisted on a ship before it was about to sail, primarily to give notice to the town that anyone owed money should claim it before the ship leaves, also to warn crew and passengers to get on board; the flag was blue with a white square in the middle; 'peter' is from the French, 'partir' meaning 'to leave'.board of directors - often reduced simply to 'the board' - from Saxon, 'bord' meaning 'table'.bobby - policeman - after Sir Robert Peel, who introduced the first police force, into London c.1830; they were earlier known as 'peelers'.bolt from the blue - sudden shock or surprise - see 'thunderbolt'.kiss the blarney stone - have great persuasive ability - the blarney stone, situated in the north corner of Blarney castle, bears the inscription 'Cormac Mac Carthy fortis me fieri fecit'; legend has it that whoever kisses the blarney stone will enjoy the same ability as MacCarthy.the bottom line - the most important aspect or point - in financial accounting the bottom line on the profit and loss sheet shows the profit or loss.boxing day - the day after Christmas - from the custom in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of servants receiving gratuities from their masters, collected in boxes in Christmas day, sometimes in churches, and distributed the day after.brassic - having no money the buck stops here - denoting ultimate responsibility - American pokerplayers of the nineteenth century would pass a piece of buckshot from player to player to signify whose responsibility to deal.bus - passenger vehicle - an abbreviation from the original 18-19th century horse-drawn 'omnibus' which in Latin means 'for all' (which is also the derivation of the term 'omnibus' when used to describe a whole week's TV soap episodes put together in one torturous weekend compilation). Unrelatedbut interestingly, French slang for the horse-drawn omnibus was 'four banal' which translated then to 'parish oven' - what a wonderful expression.by and large - generally/vaguely - one of a number of sailing terms; 'by' meant to sail within six compass points of the wind direction, 'large' was to sail at right-angles to the wind, so to steer a course of 'by and large' was very non-specific.cake walk, piece of cake/takes the cake - easy task/wins (the prize) - from the tradition of giving cakes as prizes in rural competitions. Brewer (1870) tells of the tradition in USA slavery states when slaves or free descendents would walk in a procession in pairs around a cake at a social gathering orparty, the most graceful pair being awarded the cake as a prize. This also gave us the expression 'cake walk' and 'a piece of cake' both meaning a job or contest that's very easy to achieve or win, and the variation 'takes the biscuit', meaning to win (often ironically, to be the worst).cat and fiddle - common pub name - while appearing in the famous nursery rhyme, the phrase came originally from 'Caton le fidele' (Caton the faithful) governor of Calais, France.let the cat out of the bag - give away a secret - a country folk deception was to substitute cat for a suckling pig in a bag for sale at market; if the bag was opened the trick was revealed. See also 'pig in a poke'.catch-22 - an impossible problem in which the solution effectively cancels itself out - although often mis-used to mean any difficult problem, this originally came from Joseph Heller's book of the same title about a reluctant American wartime pilot for whom the only living alternative to continuing in service was to be certified mad; the 'catch-22' was that the act of applying for certification was deemed to be the act of a perfectly sane man.caught red-handed - caught in the act of doing something wrong, or immediately afterwards with evidence showing, so that denial is pointless - the expression 'caught red-handed' has kept a consistent meaning for well over a hundred years (Brewer lists it in 1870). It's based simply on themetaphor of a murderer being caught with blood still on their hands, and therefore would date back probably to the days even before guns, when to kill another person would have involved the use of a direct-contact weapon like a dagger or club. The red-handed image is straightforward enough tohave evolved from common speech, that is to say, there's unlikely to have been one single quote that originated the expression.a chip off the old block - a small version of the original - was until recently 'of' rather than 'off', and dates back to 270 BC when Greek poet Theocrites used the expression 'a chip of the old flint' in the poem 'Idylls'.clap-trap - nonsense - original description was for something introduced into a theatrical performance or speech simply to prompt applause.living in cloud cuckoo land - being unrealistic or in a fantasy state - from the Greek word 'nephelococcygia' meaning 'cloud' and 'cuckoo', used by Aristophanes in his play The Birds, 414 BC, in which he likened Athens to a city built in the clouds by birds.close but no cigar - narrowly failing to get something right or win - from early USA slot machines which used to give a cigar as a prize.coach - tutor - originally university slang simply based on the metaphor that to get on quickly you would ride on a coach, (but not a motorised one, as the term was certainly in use by 1870 when Brewer compiled his dictionary of phrase and fable).cobblers - nonsense (from 'a load of balls', meaning testicles)cock and bull story - a false account or tall tale - from old English 'a concocted and bully story'; 'concocted' was commonly shortened to 'cock', and 'bully' meant 'exaggerated' (leading to bull-rush and bull-frog; probably from 'bullen', Danish for exaggerated); also the old London Road at Stony Stratford near Northampton, England has two old inns next to each other, called The Cock and The Bull; travellers' stories were said to have been picked up on the way at the Cock and Bull. Another source is the mythological fables of Nergal and Osiris; 'Nergal' the ancient Persian idolmeans 'dung-hill cock; 'Osiris' was an Egyptian Bull.cold turkey - withdrawal effects from abruptly ending a dependency such as drugs or alcohol - the expression seems to have been first used in this sense in the 1950's and appeared in the dictionary of American slang in 1960. The cold turkey expression is simply a metaphor for the cold sweat condition that a person experiences during dependency withdrawal. Prior to this and certainly as early as 1928 (when it appeared in the British Daily Express newspaper), the cold turkey expression meant the plain truth, blunt statements or simple facts of the matter, in turn derived from 'talk turkey', now meaning to discuss seriously the financial aspects of a deal, and earlier to talk straight and 'down-to-earth'. This early 'talk turkey' usage dates back to the early-1800's USA, and came to the UK later, as Brewer doesn't list it in his comprehensive dictionary of 1870. The word turkey is interesting: the turkey species was originally native only to Mexico where it was found domesticated by the Mexican people when the Spanish invaded in 1518. The birds were brought to England in 1524 and appeared in Europe in 1530, and by 1575 had become associated across Europe with Christmas celebrations. Turkey is a shortening of the original forms turkeycock and turkeyhen, being the names given to guinea-fowl imported from Africa by way of the country of Turkey, as far back as the 1540's. The word was soon (circa 1550's) applied erroneously to the turkey because it wasidentified with and/or treated as a species of the guinea fowl. Turkey came to mean an inept person or a failed production in the mid 1900's, because the bird was considered particularly unintelligent and witless, and this too no doubt contributed to the modern meaning of the cold turkey expression.condom - birth control sheath - a scientific approach to birth control is not a recent practice; Latin writer Pliny the Elder advocated the use of sticky cedar gum as early as the 1st century, and the Romans were using sheaths of various descriptions before then. The Italian anatomist GabrielloFallopio (yes, he was first to describe the function of the fallopian tubes) designed the first medicated linen sheath in the mid 16th century. The condom however takes its name from the Earl of Condom, personal physician to Charles II, who recommended its use to the king as a precaution against syphilis in the second half of the 17th century.cook the books - falsify business accounts - according to 18th century Brewer, 'cook the books' originally appeared as the past tense 'the books have been cooked' in a report (he didn't name the writer unfortunately) referring to the conduct George Hudson (1700-71), 'the railway king', underwhose chairmanship the accounts of Eastern Counties Railways were falsified. Brewer says then (1870) that the term specifically describes the tampering of ledger and other trade books in order to show a balance in favour of the bankrupt. Brewer also says the allusion is to preparing meat for the table. These days the term has a wider meaning, extending to any kind of creative accounting. Historical records bear this out, and date the first recorded use quite accurately: Hudson made a fortune speculating in railway shares, and then in 1845, which began the period 1845-47 known as 'railway mania' in Britain, he was exposed as a fraudster and sent to jail. Other cliche references suggest earlier usage, even 17th century, but there appears to be no real evidence of this. There is an argument for Brewer being generally pretty reliable when it comes to first recorded/published use, because simply he lived far closer to the date of origin than reference writers of today. If you read Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable you'll see it does have an extremely credible and prudent style. The word 'book' incidentally comes from old German 'buche' for beech wood, the bark of whichwas used in Europe before paper became readily available. The verb 'cook' is from Latin 'coquere'.cried all the way to the bank - financially successful despite apparent problems - a frequent quote by the pianist entertainer Liberace from 1950's and 60's, in response to questions about hostility he experienced from critics.cut and dried - already prepared or completed (particularly irreversibly), or routine, hackneyed (which seem to be more common US meanings) - the expression seems to have been in use early in the 18th century (apparently it appeared in a letter to the Rev. Henry Sacheverell dated 1710 - if you know any more about him let me know...) but Brewer makes no mention of the term in his highly authoritative dictionary in 1870, so I'd guess the term is probably US in origin. The root is likely to be a combination of various cutting and drying analogies involving something being prepared for use, including herbs, flowers, tobacco, timber and meat. The fact that there were so many applications of the process would have certainly reinforced the establishment and use of the term. 'Cut and tried' is probably a later US variant (it isn't commonly used in the UK), and stems from the tailor's practice of cutting and then trying a suit on a customer, again with a meaning of completing something.cut and run - get what you want then leave quickly - originally a sailing term, cut the ropes and run before the wind.cut to the quick - offend a person sharply and deeply - 'quick' is an old word for tender flesh, either under the skin, or especially under the fingernails; Sir Thomas More's 1551 'Utopia' included the expression 'shave to the quick' describing the ruthless exploitation of tenants by landlords, and Browning used the expression when describing a fatally wounded soldier's pride as being 'touched to the quick' in his 1842 poem 'Incident at the French camp'.damp squib - failure or anti-climax - a squib is an old word for a firework, and a wet one would obviously fail to go off properly or at all.days of wine and roses - past times of pleasure and plenty - see 'gone with the wind'.dead pan - expressionless - from the 1844 poem ('The Dead Pan') by Elizabeth Browning which told that at the time of the crucifixion the cry 'Great Pan is dead' swept across the ocean, and 'the responses of the oracles ceased for ever' (Brewer).dead wood - someone serving no use (especially when part of a working group) - from the ship-building technique of laying blocks of timber in the keel, not an essential part of the construction, simply to make the keel more rigid.december - the twelfth month - originally Latin for 'tenth month' when the year began with March.the devil to pay and no pitch hot - a vital task to do now with no resource available - see 'hell to pay'.devil's advocate - someone posing a hypothetical argument against a logical proposition - from the process in the Catholic Church of debating a name for suggested canonisation (making someone a saint); when a name is proposed someone is appointed to present an opposing argument, that person being originally called the 'advocatus diaboli'.dickens - (what the dickens, in dickens' name, hurts like the dickens, etc) - Dickens is another word for devil, and came to be used as an oath in the same way as God, Hell, Holy Mary, etc. Brewer (dictionary of phrase and fable 1870) explains that the 'dickens' oath, is a perversion (variation)of, and derived from 'Nick' and 'Old Nick'. The dickens expression appeared first probably during the 1600's. The etymology of 'nick' can be traced back a lot further - 'nicor' was Anglo-Saxon for monster. The devil-association is derived from ancient Scandinavian folklore: a Nick was mythologicalwater-wraith or kelpie, found in the sea, rivers, lakes, even waterfalls - half-child or man, half-horse - that took delight when travellers drowned. Beginning several hundred years ago both protestant and catholic clergy commonly referred to these creatures, presumably because the image offered another scary device to persuade simple people to be ever god-fearing (".....or Old Nick will surely get you when you next go to the river...") which no doubt reinforced the Nick imagery and its devil association. So too did the notoriety of Italian statesman and theorist, Niccolo Machiavelli(1469-1527) - (who also gave rise to the expression 'machiavellian', meaning deviously wicked). 'Nick' Machiavelli became an image of devilment in the Elizabethan theatre because his ideas were thought to be so heinous. Shakespeare has Mistress Page using the 'what the dickens' expression in theMerry Wives of Windsor, c.1600, so the expression certainly didn't originate as a reference to Charles Dickens as many believe, who wasn't born until 1812. Charles Dickens' fame however (he was extremely famous in England while alive and writing as well as ever since) would certainly have further reinforced the popularity of the 'dickens' expression.die hard - fierce or resilient - the die-hards were the British 57th Foot regiment, so called after their Colonel Inglis addressed them before the (victorious) battle of Albuera against Napoleon's French on 16 May in 1811, 'Die hard my lads, die hard'. Only one officer of 24 survived, and only 168 men of 584. The regiment later became the West Middlesex.the die is cast - a crucial irreversible decision has been made - Julius Caesar in 49 BC used the metaphor to describe a military move into Italy across the river Rubicon, which he knew would give rise to a conflict he had to win. The metaphor relates to the throwing of a single die (dice being theplural). See also 'cross the rubicon'.dipstick - idiotdog in a manger - someone who prevents others from using something even though he's not using it himself - from Aesop's fable about the dog who sits in the manger with no need of the hay in it, and angrily prevents the cattle from coming near and eating it.doldrums - depressed lazy state - area of the ocean near the equator between the NE and SE trade winds, noted for calms, sudden squalls and unpredictable winds.doolally - mad or crazy (describing a person) - originally a military term from India. Soldiers at the end of their term were sent to Deodali, a town near Bombay, to wait to be shipped home. The hot climate, frustration and boredom caused odd behaviour among the delayed troops, who were said to be suffering from 'doolally tap', which was the full expression. 'Tap' was the East Indian word for malarial fever.doss-house - rough sleeping accommodation - the term is from Elizabethan England when 'doss' was a straw bed, from 'dossel' meaning bundle of straw, in turn from the French 'dossier' meaning bundle.double whammy - two problems in one - from the American cartoon strip character 'Li'l Abner' by Al Capp (1909-79), who could cast a spell on someone by 'aiming' at them with his finger and one eye open; he called it 'shooting a whammy'. He could shoot a 'double whammy' by aiming with botheyes open.down in the dumps - miserable - from earlier English 'in the dumps'; 'dumps' derives from Dumops, the fabled Egyptian king who built a pyramid died of melancholy. Dumm also means 'stupid' or 'dull' in German.draconian - harsh (law or punishment) - from seventh century BC when Athens appointed a man called Draco to oversee the transfer of responsibility for criminal punishment to the state; even minor crimes were said to carry the death penalty, and the laws were apparently written in blood.at the drop of a hat - instantly - from a traditional way of starting a race in the 1800's.drum - house or apartment - from a nineteenth century expression for a house party, derived originally from an abbreviation of 'drawing room'.dum-dum bullet - a bullet with a soft or cut nose, so as to split on impact and cause maximum harm - from the town Dum Dum in India, where the bullets were first produced.duck (also duckie) - term of endearment like 'my dear' or 'darling', from the east midlands of England - originated from Norwegian and Danish 'dukke' meaning 'doll' or 'baby'; this area also has many towns and villages ending in 'by' (Rugby, Derby, Corby, Ashby, Blaby, Cosby, Enderby, Groby, etc), which is Norse for a small settlement or farm.dunderhead - muddle-headed person - 'dunder' was the dregs or over-flowed froth of fermenting wine, originally from Spanish 'redundar', to overflow or froth over. (The Oxford English dictionary says this origin is 'perhaps from 17th century English dunner, meaning a resounding noise; we doubt itsomehow...)dutch courage - bravery boosted by alcohol - from the 17th century story of the sailors aboard the Hollander 'man-o-war' British warship being given a hogshead of brandy before engaging the enemy during the Dutch Wars.dutch auction - where the price decreases, rather than increases, between bidders (sellers in this case) prior to the sale - 'dutch' was used in a variety of old English expressions to suggest something is not the real thing (dutch courage, dutch comfort, dutch concert, dutch gold) and in this case a dutch auction meant that it is not a real auction at all.dyed in the wool - deeply and resolutely (especially having a particular belief or behaviour) - from the process of colouring wool, which can be done at various stages; to dye 'in the wool', before spinning is the earliest stage it can be done, and it gives the most thorough effect.egg on your face - to look stupid - from the tradition of poor stage performers having eggs thrown at them.eleventh hour - just in time - from the Bible, Matthew xx.1.make ends meet - budget tightly - the metaphor was originally wearing a shorter (tighter) belt.an Englishman's home is his castle - a person's home is or should be sacrosanct - from old English law when bailiffs were not allowed to force entry into a dwelling to seize goods or make arrest.etiquette - how to behave in polite society - originally from French and Spanish words ('etiquette' and 'etiqueta' meaning book of court ceremonies); a card was given to those attending Court (not necessarily law court, more the court of the ruling power) containing directions and rules; the practice of issuing a card with instructions dates back to the soldier's billet (a document), which was the order to board and lodge the soldier bearing it. See also 'that's the ticket'.the exception proves the rule - the common meaning today is that the existence of an exception is in some way evidence that the rule exists (which is somewhat illogical) - this has to be one of the most confused figures of speech in the English language; the original expression actually derives from a Latin legal term from the 1600's, 'exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis' ('in the cases not excepted') which came into common use as 'exceptio probat regulam' ('the exception establishes the rule'), whose proper and logical meaning was that the exception provides the opportunity to test and refine more accurately the scope of the rule, (neither proving the existence or otherwise of the exception or the rule!). Isn't language wonderful!....play fast and loose - be unreliable, say one thing and do another - originally from a fairground trick, in which the player was invited to pin a folded belt 'fast' (firmly) to the table with a skewer, at which the stall-holder would pull both ends of the belt to 'loose' it free and show that it had not been pinned.a feather in your cap - a recognised achievement - from the ancient custom seen in various cultures of warriers and hunters adding a feather to their headgear for each kill (eg., native American Indians, the Incas, Abyssinians, Lycians, and the Caufirs of Cabul); it was even customary in Scottish and Welsh field shooting for for the first to kill a woodcock to do the same; maybe still is....fiasco - something gone badly wrong - from the Italian metaphor; when making Venetian glass if the slightest flaw was seen the glassblower turned the article into a 'fiasco' - a common flask.flash in the pan - brief and unexpected success - evolved from earlier slightly different meaning: an effort which fails to come to fruition, which was based on an old firearms metaphor: ie the accidental premature ignition of the priming gunpowder contained the the 'pan' (part of an old gun's lock) which would normally ignite the charge in the barrel.flogging a dead horse - trying to sell the unsaleable - The British MP Bright, c.1868, described Earl Russell's Reform Bill as a 'dead horse' and all attempts to make it law like 'flogging a dead horse'.fly in the face of - go against accepted wisdom, knowledge or common practice - an expression in use in the 19th century and probably even earlier, from falconry, where the allusion is to a falcon or other bird of prey flying at the face of its master instead of settling on the falconers gauntlet.font - typeface - from the French 'fonte', in turn from 'fondre' (like 'foundry') meaning to melt or cast (printing originally used cast metal type, which was 'set' to make the printing plates).foolscap - a certain size of paper - from the Italian 'foglio-capo' meaning folio-sized (folio was originally a book formed by folding a large sheet once to create two leaves, and nowadays means 'folder'). Water-marks on foolscap paper from 13-17th centuries showed a 'fool' (a jester with cap and bells).there ain't no such thing as a free lunch - you never get something for nothing - now a common business expression, often used in acronym form 'TANSTAAFL', the first recorded use of this version was by Robert Heinlein in his 1966 book 'The moon is a harsh princess'. The general expression 'there's no such thing as a free lunch' dates back to the custom of America 19th century bars giving free snacks in expectation of customers buying drink. American economist Milton Friedman, who won the 1976 Nobel prize for economics, did much to popularise the expression in that form and even usedit as a title for one of his books.funny bone - semi-exposed nerve in elbow - a pun based on 'humerus', the name of the upper arm bone.the full monty - the full potential of anything, or recently, full frontal nudity (since the film of the same name) - the two much earlier origins are: 1. Field Marshall Montgomery's insistence on a full English breakfast every morning, and 2. a full Sunday-best suit and tie outfit from the tailorsMontague Burton.gamut - whole range - originally 'gammut' from 'gamma ut', which was the name of the lowest note of the medieval music scale during its development into today's 'doh re mi fa so la ti doh'; then it was 'ut re mi fa sol la', and the then diatonic scale was referred to as the gammut.gander - to look at something enthusiastically - an old English expression from the image of a goose (gander is a male goose and was earlier the common word for a goose) craning its neck to look at something.gerrymander - to divide an area into representative districts to the advantage of one political party - from when Eldridge Gerry used the method as Governor of Massachusetts; the map artist Gilbert Stuart interpreted the new shape as a salamander, receiving the comment that it was not asalamander, it was a 'gerry-mander'.Gestapo - Nazi Germany's secret police - from the official name of Germany's Securty Department, GEheime STAats POlizei, meaning 'Secret State Police', which was founded by Hermann Goering in 1933, and later controlled by Heinrich Himmler. The Gestapo was declared a criminal organisation by the Nuremburg Tribunal in 1946. The pattern for establishing the acronym probably originated from the former name for the ordinary civil police, 'Schupo, from 'SCHUtz POlizei'.gibberish - nonsense - first came into European language in various forms hundreds of years ago; derives from 'Geber' the Arabian; he was an 11th century alchemist who wrote his theories on making gold and other substances in mystical jargon, because at that time in his country writing openly onalchemy was punishable by death.good-bye - originally a contraction of 'God be with ye (you)'; 'God' developed into 'good', in the same style as good day, good evening, etc.; 'good be with ye' would have meant 'may you fare well'.greenback - American dollar note - from when the backs of banknotes issued in 1862 during the American Civil were printed in green.greyhound - racing dog - originally 'grayhound' these dogs used to hunt badgers, which were called 'grays'.grog - derogatory term for beer or other alcoholic drink - after Admiral Edward Vernon, who because he wore a grogram cloak was called 'old grog' by his sailors; (grogram is a course fabric of silk, mohair and wool, stiffened by gum). In 1740 Admiral Vernon was the first to serve rum diluted with water and lime juice to seamen, instead of neat rum, and his sailors called the new drink 'grog'. The purpose was chiefly to increase resistance to the disease, scurvy, which resulted from vitamin C deficiency. The practise of ensuring a regular intake of vitamin C in this way also gave rise to theterm 'limey', used by foreigners initally to mean a British seaman, and later extended to British men generally.guillotine - now a cutting device particularly for paper, or verb 'to cut' - named after the machine's inventor, Joseph Guillotin, a French physician, who devised the contraption as a means of performing the death penalty by beheading without unnecessary pain; it was introduced in France in 1792, andfascinatingly Brewer's 1870 derivation refers to its continuing use. It was riginally called 'Guillotin's daughter'.guinea-pig - a person subjected to testing or experiment - not a reference to animal testing, this term was originally used to describe a volunteer (for various ad hoc duties, including director of a company, a juryman, a military officer, a clergyman) for which they would receive a nominal fee ofa guinea, or a guinea a day. Incidentally, guineapigs didn't come from Guinea (in West Africa), they came from Guyana (South America).guy-rope - used to steady or or hold up something, especially a tent - from Spanish 'guiar', meaning 'to guide'.gymnastics - athletic exercises - from the Greek word 'gymnasium', which was where athletic sports were performed for the public's entertainment; athletes performed naked, and here lies the origin: 'gumnos' is Greek for naked.hand over fist - very rapidly (losing or accumulating, usually money) - from a naval expression 'hand over hand' which Brewer references in 1870. Hand over hand meant to travel or progress very quickly, usually up or down, from the analogy of a sailor climbing a rope, or hauling one in 'hand over hand'. The expression extended to grabbing fistfuls of money sometime after 1870 (otherwise Brewer would almost certainly have referenced it), probably late 19th century.hard and fast - firmly, especially rules - another nautical term; 'hard' meant that the ship was immovable, 'hard and fast' meant in dry dock.hair of the dog - a small drink of alcohol to cure a hangover - and very old expression; the full expression is 'a hair of the dog that bit you', and originates from a poem credited to Aristophanes, Greek comic dramatist (448-387 BC): 'Take the hair, it's well written, of the dog by which you'rebitten, work off one wine by his brother, and one labour with another...'handicap - disadvantage - from an old English card game called 'hand I the cap', in which the cap (which held the stake money) was passed to the next dealer unless the present dealer raised his starting stake, by virtue of having won the previous hand, which required the dealer to raise his stake (hence the disadvantage) by the same factor as the number of hands he had beaten. The game was first reported by Samuel Pepys in his diary, 18 Sept 1680.hang out - to frequent or be found at - sounds like a recent expression but it's 1830's or earlier, originally meant 'where one lives and works' from the custom of hanging a sign of occupation or trade outside a shop or business, as pubs still do.heads or tails - said on flipping a coin - Brewer gave the explanation in 1870; it's an old English expression, with even earlier roots: 'heads' because all coins had a head on one side; the other had various emblems: Britannia, George and the Dragon, a harp, a the royal crest of arms, or an inscription, which were all encompassed by the word 'tails', meaning the opposite to heads. Tails was the traditional and obvious opposite to heads (as in 'can't make head nor tail of it'). The pluralisation came about because coin flipping was a guessing game in itself - actually dating back to Roman times, who, due to their own coin designs called the game 'heads or ships'.hell hath no fury like a woman scorned - ignore a woman's wishes and she is liable to be extremely angry - originally from William Congreve's 1697 play The Mourning Bride: 'Heaven has no rage, like love to hatred turned, Nor hell a fury, like woman scorned.'hell to pay - seriously bad consequences - a nautical expression; 'pay' meant to waterproof a ship's seems with tar. Probably derived from the expression 'the devil to pay and no pitch hot', referring to when a ship was turned on its side for repairing, just out of the water with the keel exposed while the tide was out; the 'devil' was the seem between the ship's keel and garboard-strake (the bottom-most planks connecting to the keel), so-called due to its inaccessibility.hob-nob - to socialise, particularly drink with - was originally 'hob and nob together', when hob-nob had another entirely different meaning, now obsolete ('hit or miss' or 'give and take' from 'to have or not have', from the Anglo-Saxon 'habben' have, and 'nabben' not to have); today's modern drink with' meaning derives from the custom of pubs having a 'hob' in the fireplace on which to warm the beer, and a small table there at which to sit cosily called a 'nob', hence 'hob and nob'.hobson's choice - no choice at all - from the story of Tobias Hobson, Cambridge innkeeper who had a great selection of horses available to travellers, but always on the basis that they took the horse which stood nearest to the stable door (so that, according to 'The Spectator' journal of the time, 'each customer and horse was served with the same justice').hoi polloi - an ordinary mass of people - it literally means in Greek 'the many', (so the 'the' in common usage is actually redundant).holy mackerel - exclamation of surprise - A blasphemous oath from the same 'family' as goddam and darn it, etc. Holy Mackerel dates back at least 200 years and is one of very many blasphemous oaths with the Holy prefix. Holy Mackerel was almost certainly a reference to Catholics eating fish on Fridays (rather like Holy Cow is a reference to Hindus, and Holy Moses - shortened to the rhyming Holy Moley - the way that the words trip of the tongue is very significant in how these expressions become widely used and adopted, and Holy Mackerel does have a certain ring to it, in a way that Holy Skate, or Holy Cod do not..... ). As well as being a popularly eaten fish of the times (affordable by Catholics on limited budgets - the insulting term 'mackerel snatchers' was also used for Catholics in the 19th century), the word Mackerel has historically been a strong fish symbol and fish stereotype (the French word maquereau is slang for 'pimp', due to its habit supposedly of leading other fish to their mates). The term Holy Mackerel would also have served as a euphemistic substitute for Holy Mary or Holy Mother of God, which is why words beginning with M feature commonly in these expressions.home sweet home - sentimental expression of home - from American John Howard Payne's words for the 1823 opera, The Maid of Milan, the song's word's are ''Be it never so humble, there's no place like home'.honcho - boss - originally an American expression from the 2nd World War, derived from the Japanese 'hancho' meaning squad leader.honeymoon - holiday after marriage - derived from the practice of the ancient Teutons, Germanic people of the 2nd century BC, who drank 'hydromel' (honey wine) for a 'moon' (thirty days) after marriage. Apparently Attila the Hun drank so much hydromel at his wedding feast that he died.by hook or by crook - any way possible - in early England the poor of the manor were able to to collect wood from the forest by using a metal spiked hook and a crook (a staff with hooked end used by shepherds), using the crook to pull down what they couldn't reach with the hook. The equivalentFrench expression means 'either with the thief's hook or the bishop's crook'. The expression has also been reinforced by a fabled Irish battle to take Waterford from the sea, when the invasion leader, Strongbow, learned that the Tower of Hook and the Church of Crook stood on either side of theharbour remarked that he would take the town 'by hook or by crook'.horse-shoe - lucky symbol - the superstition dates from the story of the devil visiting St Dunstan, who was a skilled blacksmith, asking for a single hoof to be shod. Dunstan tied him to the wall and purposefully subjected the devil to so much pain that he agreed never to enter any place displaying ahorse-shoe.hue and cry - noisy mob - an old English legal term dating from the 13th century, for a group pursuing a suspected villain; 'hue' is from 'the French 'huee', to shout after.eat humble pie - acknowledge one's own mistake or adopt a subordinate position - nothing to do with the word 'humble' originally; 'umbles' were the offal of animals hunted for their meat; while the lord and his guests dined on venison, his hunting staff ate pie made from the umbles.humbug - nonsense, particularly when purporting to be elevated language - probably from 'uomo bugiardo', Italian for 'lying man'. Reinforced by an early meaning of 'hum', to deceive (with false applause or flattery).iota - very small amount - 'iota' is the name of the letter 'i' in the Greek alphabet, its smallest letter.January - the month - 'Janus' the mythical Roman character had two faces, and so could look back over the past year and forward to the present one.jeep - the vehicle and car company - the first 4x4 of them all, made by the Americans for the 2nd World War - it was called a General Purpose vehicle, shortened to 'GP' and then by US GI's to 'jeep', which then became the company name.juggernaut - huge vehicle - derived from the Hindu God, and then a temple of the same name, originally 'Jagannatha', meaning 'lord of the world'. 'The Car of the Juggernaut' was the huge wooden machine with sixteen wheels containing a bride for the God; fifty men would drag the vehicle the temple, while devotees threw themselves under it ('as persons in England under a train' as Brewer remarked in 1870).kick the bucket - die - in early English a bucket was a beam or pulley, by which slaughtered pigs or oxen were hung by their feet. (The sense of something rising up and 'kicking' or hitting a beam is found also in 'kick the beam', an old expression meaning to be of very light weight, the beam being the cross-member of weighing scales; a light pan on one side would fly up and 'kick' the beam.)kill with kindness - from the story of how Draco (see 'draconian') met his death, supposedly by being smothered and suffocated by caps and cloaks thrown onto him at the theatre of Aegina, from spectators showing their appreciation of him, 590 BC.kiss it better - the custom of kissing someone where injured - originates from the practice of sucking poison from a wound or venomous bite.knuckle-duster - weapon worn over fist - the term 'dust' meant 'beat', from the practice of dusting (beating) carpets; an early expression for beating someone was to 'dust your jacket'.lame duck - person or thing no longer for purpose - originally an old London stock exchange term for a member unable to meet their obligations on settlement day, since they 'waddled' out of Exchange Alley, which existed until 1773.left in the lurch - left stranded or perplexed - the word 'lurch' originates from 16th century French 'lourche', a game like backgammon; a 'lurch' in the card-game cribbage meant only scoring 31 against an opponent's score of 61, and this meaning of being left well behind was transferred to other gamesbefore coming into wider metaphoric use.legend in his/her own lifetime - very famous - originally written by Lytton Strachey of Florence Nightingale in his book Eminent Victorians, 1918.let sleeping dogs lie - don't stir up a potentially difficult situation when it's best left alone - originated by Chaucer around 1380 in Troilus and Criseyde, 'It is nought good a slepyng hound to wake'.level best - very best effort - probably from the metaphor of panning for gold in 19th century America, when for the best results, the pan was kept as level as possible in order to see any fragments of gold.library - collection of books - from the Latin, 'liber', which was the word for rind beneath the bark of certain trees which was used a material for writing on before paper was invented; (the French for 'book, 'livre' derives from the same source).lick and a promise - the hasty performance of a task, or something not done properly, also (originally) a hasty wash - the expression is probably from the first half of the 20th century, possibly around 1910-20's, and originally meant a quick or superficial wash (usually of a child's face by the child). It was certainly well in use by the 1930's for the original literal meaning. The expression couldn't have originated a lot earlier as nobody washed much before then anyway. The full expression was along the lines of 'a lick and a promise of a better wash to come'. 'Lick' would no doubt have been an obvious element in the 'lick and promise' expression as it had been a strong metaphorical word since 15th century. It crops up in other expressions (eg 'lick your wounds', and 'lick into shape', the latter made popular from Shakespeare's Richard III, from the common idea then of new-born animals being literally licked into shape by their mothers.)life of Riley - very comfortable existence - based on the 1880's music-hall song performed by Pat Rooney about the good life of a character called O'Reilly; the audience would sing the chorus which ended '..are you the O'Reilly who keeps this hotel? Are you the O'Reilly they speak of so well? 'Are you the O'Reilly they speak of so highly, Gor Blime me O'Reilly, you're looking well'. The expression 'Blimey O'Riley' probably originated here also.limbo - state of uncertain balance or being between two situations - today's use is based on two separate meanings which may both have had the same origin: 'limbo' is the Caribbean dance requiring excellent balancing skills, in which the performer repeatedly passes beneath a horizontal bar reducingin height each time; the early English meaning of 'limbo' was for a temporary holding place, e.g. between heaven and hell, or a waste basket; it also meant 'prison' in Victorian times; original derivation from Latin 'limbus' meaning 'the edge'.line - nature of business - dates back to the scriptures, when a line would be drawn to denote the land or plot of tribe; 'line' came to mean position, which evolved into 'trade' or 'calling'.line your pockets - make a lot of money for yourself, perhaps not legitimately - from the early 18th century, when the court tailor sought the patronage of the famous dandy, George 'Beau' Brummell, he supposedly sent him a dress coat with the pockets lined with bank-notes.lion's share - much the largest share - originally meant 'all of it', from Aesop's fables, the story of the lion who when hunting with a heifer, a goat and a sheep, had agreed to share the quarry equally four ways, but on killing a stag then justifies in turn why he should keep each quarter, first because he was 'the lion', then 'the strongest', then 'the most valiant', and finally 'touch it if you dare'.a licence to print money - legitimate easy way of making money - expression credited to Lord Thomson in 1957 on his ownership of a commercial TV company.loose cannon - a reckless member of a team - from the days when sailing warships were armed with enormous cannons on wheels; if a tethered cannon broke loose it could do enormous damage.lock, stock and barrel - everything - from the 1700's, based on the metaphor of all of the parts of a gun, namely the lock (the firing mechanism), the stock (the wooden section) and the barrel.luddite - one who rejects new technology - after the Luddite rioters of 1811-16, who in defence of labourers' jobs in early industrial Britain wrecked new manufacturing machinery. Their leader was called General Lud, supposedly after Ned Lud, a mad man of Leicestershire who had earlier gainednotoriety after he chased a group of tormenting boys into a building and then attacked two textiles machines.man of straw - a man of no substance or capital - in early England certain poor men would loiter around the law courts offering to be a false witness for anyone if paid; they showed their availability by wearing a straw in their shoe.mealy-mouthed - hypocritical or smooth-tongued - from the Greek 'meli-muthos' meaning 'honey-speech'.mentor - personal tutor or counsellor - after 'Mentor', friend of Ulysses; Ulysses was the mythical Greek king of Ithica who took Troy with the wooden horse, as told in Homer's Iliad and Oddysey epic poems of the 8th century BC.mob - unruly gathering - from the Latin 'mobile vulgus' meaning 'fickle crowd'.movers and shakers - powerful people who get things done - a combination of separate terms from respectively George Chapman's 1611 translation of Homer's Iliad, , '..thou mightie shaker of the earth..' and Shakespeare's Henry VI part II, when Henry at Cardinal Beaufort's deathbed beseeches God '..thou eternal mover of the heavens, look with a gentle eye upon this wretch'. The English poet Arthur O'Shaunessy's poem 'Ode' (about the power of poetry) written in 1874 is the first recorded use of the combined term 'We are the music-makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams.... yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems.'to the nth degree - to the utmost extent required - 'n' is the mathematical symbol meaning 'any number'. The expression originated from University slang from the 19th century when 'nth plus 1', meant 'to the utmost', derived from mathematical formulae where 'n+1' was used to signify 'one more than any number'. An early variation on this cliche 'cut to the nth', meaning 'to be completely spurned by a friend' (similar to the current 'cut to the quick') has since faded from use.nail your colours to the mast - take a firm position - warships surrendered by lowering their colours (flags), so nailing them to the mast would mean that there could be no surrender.the naked truth - the completely unobscured facts - the ancient fable (according to 1870 Brewer) says that Truth and Falsehood went bathing and Falsehood stole Truth's clothes. Truth refused to take Falsehood's and so went naked.nap - big single gamble or tip in horse racing, also the name of the card game - from the earlier English expressions 'go to nap' and 'go nap', meaning to stake all of the winnings on one hand of cards, or attempt to win all five tricks in a hand, derived originally and abbreviated from the card-game 'Napolean' after Napolean III (N.B. Napolean III - according to Brewer - not Bonaparte, who was his uncle).navvy - road workman - from 'navigator', which was the word used for a worker who excavated the canals in England starting around 1755. (Canals were thought of as inland navigation lines, and inns alongside them were and are still commonly called 'the navigation'.)niche - segment or small area, usually meaning suitable for business specialisation - the use of the word 'niche' was popularised by the 19th century expression 'a niche in the temple of fame' which referred to the Pantheon, originally a church in Paris (not the Pantheon in Rome). It was built 1754-80 and converted in 1791 to hold the remains of famous Frenchmen; a 'niche' was a small alcove containing a monument to a person's name and deeds. The French word 'nicher' means 'to make a nest'.nickname - an alternative familiar name for someone or something - from 'an eke name' which became written 'a neke name'; 'eke' is an extremely old word (ie several centuries BC) meaning 'also'. It was also an old English word for an enlarging section added to the base of a beehive.(give something or someone).the whole nine yards - to give absolute maximum effort when trying to win or achieve something - most likely from the 2nd World War, based on the nine yards length of certain aircraft munitionbelts; supposedly the American B-17 aircraft (ack Guy Avenell); the RAF Spitfire's machine gun bullet belts, also supposedly the length of American bomber bomb racks, and the length of ammunition belts in ground based anti-aircraft turrets. Other suggested origins will all have helped reinforce the expression: Amercan concrete trucks were supposed to have nine cubic yards capacity; tailors were supposed to use nine yards of material for top quality suits (see 'dressed to the nines'). And there are are a couple of naval references too (the latter one certainly a less likely origin because the expression is not recorded until the second half of the 20th century): nine naval shipyards, or alternatively nine yardarms: (large sailing ships had three masts, each with three yardarms) giving a full sailing strength based on the unfurled sails of nine yard arms.dressed up to the nines - wearing very smart or elaborate clothes - the expression dates from 17th century England, originally meaning dressed to perfection from head to foot. Dressed up to the nines is one of many references to the number nine as a symbol of perfection, superlative, and completeness, originating from ancient Greek, Pythagorean theory: man is a full chord, ie, eight; and deity (Godliness) comes next. Three represents the Trinity, twice three is the perfect dual, and thrice three, i.e., nine, represents the 'perfect plural'. The representation of divine perfection wasstrengthened by various other images, including: Deucalion's Ark, made on the advice of Prometheus, was tossed for nine days before being stranded on the top of Mount Parnassus; the Nine Earths (Milton told of 'nine enfolded spheres'); the Nine Heavens; the Nine Muses; Southern Indians worshipped the Nine Serpents, a cat has nine lives, etc, etc. The Old English 'then eyen', meaning 'to the eyes' might also have contributed to the early establishment of the expression. The notion that tailors used nine yards of material to make a suit or a shirt, whether correct or not, also will have reinforced the usage.nip and tuck - a closely fought contest or race, with the lead or ascendancy frequently changing - explanations as to the origin of this expression are hard to find, apparently because there are so many different possible meanings for each of the two words. I reckon it's quite simple: the nip andtuck expression equates to 'blow-for blow', whereby nip and tuck are based on the old aggressive meanings of each word: nip means pinch or suddenly bite, (as it has done for centuries all over Europe, in various forms), and tuck meant stab (after the small narrow sword or dirk called a tuck, used by artillerymen). The aggressive connotation of tuck would also have been reinforced by older meanings from various Old English, Dutch and German roots; 'togian' (pull or tow), 'tucian' (mistreat, torment), and 'zucken' (jerk or tug). While the individual meanings of nip and tuck are listed separately by Brewer in 1870, the full expression isn't listed, so it was unlikely to have been in use at that time. It's not possible to say precisely who first coined the phrase, just as no-one knows who first said 'blow-for-blow'. (That pre-dates by hundreds of years the modern meaning of tuck, as in fold or pleat or push into a tight space 'there ain't no such thing as a free lunch' - you never get something for nothing - now a common business expression, often used in acronym form 'TANSTAAFL', the first recorded use of this version was by Robert Heinlein in his 1966 book 'The moon is a harsh mistress'. The general expression 'there's no such thing as a free lunch' dates back to the custom of America 19th century bars giving free snacks in expectation of customers buying drink. American economist Milton Friedman, who won the 1976 Nobel prize for economics, did much to popularise the expression in that form and even used it as a title for one of his books.in a nutshell - drastically reduced or summarised - from a series of idiotic debates (possibly prompted as early as 77 AD by Latin writer Pliny the Elder in his book Historia Naturalis), that seem to have occurred in the early 19th century as to the feasibility of engraving or writing great long literary works (for example Homer's Iliad and the Koran) in such tiny form and on such a small piece of parchment that each would fit into the shell of a common-sized nut. One chap, George Marsh, claimed to have seen the entire Koran on a parchment roll measuring four inches by half and inch.off-hand - surprisingly unpleasant (describing someone's attitude) - evolved from the older expression when 'off-hand' meant 'unprepared', which derived from its logical opposite, 'in-hand' used to describe something that was 'in preparation'.okay (OK) - Okay is one of the most commonly sought and debated expressions origins. 'OK' and 'okay' almost certainly had different origins, although the meanings were all similar and now have completely converged. There are various sources of both versions, which perhaps explains why the term is so widely established and used: The first publicly acknowledged recorded use of 'OK' was by or associated with Andrew Jackson, 7th US President from 1829-37, to mean 'Orl Korrect',possibly attributed in misspelt form to him mocking his early lack of education. The first use of 'OK' in print was in the Boston Morning Post of 23 March 1839 by CG Green, as a reference to 'Old Kinderhook', the nickname for Martin Van Buren, (a favourite of and successor to Jackson), who was 8th US President from 1837-41, whose home town was Kinderbrook, New York. The African US slave languages 'Ewe' and 'Wolof' both contained the word 'okay' to mean 'good'. Slavery in the US effectively began in 1620 and lasted until 1863, so this was certainly an early American origin of theterm. Probably even pre-dating this was the derivation of the term 'okay', meaning good, from the native American Choctow language. The American anecdotal explanation of railroad clerk Obidiah Kelly marking every parcel that he handled with his initials is probably not true, nevertheless the myth itself helped establish the term. Perhaps just as tenuously, from the early 1800's the French term 'Aux Quais', meaning 'at or to the quays' was marked on bales of cotton in the Mississippi River ports, as a sign of the bale being handled or processed and therefore 'okayed'. (The modern-day French public notice 'acces aux quais', means to the trains.) The expression '0 Killed' was a standard report on the night's fatalities during the First World War, 1914-18. In Europe, The Latin term 'Omnes Korrectes' was traditionally marked on students test papers to mean 'all correct'. The Greek 'ola kala' means 'all is well'. The Finnish 'oikea' means correct. Scottish 'och aye' means 'yes' or 'for sure' (from the Scottish pronunciation of 'oh, aye', aye being old English for yes).pour oil on troubled waters - calm difficult matters - according to Brewer in 1870 this is from a story written by the Venerable Bede in 735, relating the 7th century exploits of St Aidan, who apparently provided a young priest with a pot of oil just in case the sea got rough on his return journey after escorting a young maiden to wed a certain King Oswin of Oswy. The sea did get rough, the priest did pour on the oil, and the sea did calm, and it must be true because Brewer says that the Venerable Bede said he heard the story from 'a most creditable man in holy orders'. (As an aside, in his work 'Perfect Storm', Sebastian Junger argues that pouring oil on water actually makes matters worse: he states that pollution is responsible for an increase in the size of waves in storms. Apparently, normal healthy algae create a smoothing, lubricating effect on the surface of sea water. Suppressing the algae with pollution reduces the lubricating action, resulting in a roughersurface, which enables the wind to grip and move the water into increasingly larger wave formations. Ack. Brian McNee).over a barrel - powerless to resist - people rescued from drowning were draped head-down over a barrel in the hope of forcing water from the lungs.beyond the pale - behaviour outside normal accepted limits - In the 14th century Pale meant the area owned by an authority, such as a cathedral, and specifically the 'English Pale' described Irish land ruled by England, beyond which was considered uncivilised, and populated by barbarians. ThePale also described a part of Russia to which Jews were confined. This territorial meaning of Pale derives from its earlier meaning for a pointed wooden stake used for fencing, or the boundary itself, from the French 'pal' and latin 'pallus'.pamphlet - paper leaflet or light booklet - most likely from a Greek lady called Pamphila, whose main work was a book of notes and anecdotes (says 1870 Brewer). Alternatively, or maybe also and converging from the French 'par un filet' meaning 'held by a thread' (says Dr Samuel Johnson circa1755).panacea - cure or solution for wide-ranging problem - evolved from the more literal meaning 'universal cure', after Panacea the daughter of Esculapios, the God of medicine, and derived originally from the Greek words 'pan akomai', which meant 'all I cure'.paraphernalia - personal belongings, or accessories, equipment associated with a trade or hobby - original meaning from Roman times described the possessions (furniture, clothes, jewellery, etc) that a widow could claim from her husband's estate beyond her share of land, property and financial assets. Derived from the Greek, 'parapherne' meaning 'beyond dower' (dower meaning a widow's share of her husband's estate).pay through the nose - reluctantly have to pay too much - from the 9th century house tax imposed on the Irish by the Danes, called the Nose Tax because anyone who avoided paying their ounce of gold had his nose slit.peeping tom - someone who secretly looks at others in a private state of undress or intimacy - from the story of Lady Godiva, who in 1040 rode naked through the streets of Coventry in response to her husband, Leofric, imposing a new harsh tax on the townsfolk (he'd said that he would withdrawthe tax if she rode naked from one end of town to the other). The townsfolk agreed not to look and moreover that anyone who did should be executed. A tailor, presumably called Tom, was said to have peeped, and had his eyes put out as a result. Leofric withdrew the tax.keep you pecker up - be happy in the face of adversity - 'pecker' simply meant 'mouth' ('peck' describes various actions of the mouth - eat, kiss, etc, and peckish means hungry); the expression is more colourful than simply saying 'keep your head up'.pen - writing instrument - from Latin 'penna' meaning 'feather'; old quill pens, before fountain pens and ball pens, were made of a single feather.pick holes - determinedly find lots of faults - from an earlier English expression 'to pick a hole in someone's coat' which meant to concentrate on a small fault in a person who was largely good.pig in a poke - something sub-standard that is bought without proper examination - from the country trick of a putting a cat in a bag to pass it off as a suckling pig; 'poke' is an old English word for bag, from the French 'poche' for bag or pocket. See also 'let the cat out of the bag'.pigs might fly - sardonic reference to the highly unlikely - whilst there's no generally acknowledged origin, this expression probably derives from Lewis Carroll's 1872 'Through The Looking Glass', when the ridiculous notion of a flying pig is clearly established: 'The time has come' the walrus said,To talk of many things: Of shoes - and ships - and sealing wax, Of cabbages - and kings - And why the sea is boiling hot - And whether pigs have wings..' (1870 Brewer doesn't mention the 'pigs might fly' expression although other pig-related expressions are mentioned - suggesting that the expression developed after 1870, consistent with the Lewis Carroll source).pin money - very little or unimportant earnings usually from a small job - the expression originated from when pins were not commonly available (pins were invented in the 14th century); the custom was for pin-makers to offer them for general sale only on 1st and 2nd January. Upper-class women would be given an allowance by their husbands to buy the pins. Amazing but true. (Brewer says so.)from pillar to post - having to go to lots of places, probably unwillingly or unnecessarily - from the metaphor of a riding school, when horses were ridden in and around a ring which contained a central pillar, and surrounding posts in pairs.pipped at the post - defeated at the last moment - while the full expression is not surprisingly from horse-racing (defeated at the winning post), the origin of the 'pip' element is the most interesting part. Pip is an old slang expression for defeat, and here's how: it's derived from the term'blackball', meaning to deny access - originally to a club - or to shun (i.e. defeat). The traditional club membership voting method (which Brewer says in 1870 is old-fashioned, so the practice was certainly mid-19th C or earlier) was for members to place either a black ball (against) or a red or white ball (for) in a box or bag. The balls were counted and if there were more blacks than reds or whites then the membership application was denied - the prospective new member was 'blackballed'. The black ball was called a pip (after the pip of a fruit, in turn from earlier similar words which meantthe fruit itself, eg pippin, and the Greek, pepe for melon), so pipped became another way or saying blackballed or defeated.plain sailing - easy - from 17-18th century, originally 'plane sailing', the term for a quick method of navigating short distances, when positions and distances could be plotted as if on a flat plane rather than a curved surface.posh - upper-class - from the days went people with wealth insisted on having cabins on the Port side from the Outward journey and the Starboard side for the Homeward journey.pull out all the stops - apply best effort - from the metaphor of pulling out all the stops on an organ, which would increase the volume.puss - cat - earlier in England puss meant cat, or hare or rabbit. It derives from the Irish 'pus', for cat. In the old poem about the race between the hare and the tortoise, the hare is referred to by his adversary as 'puss'.pyrrhic victory - a win with such heavy cost as to amount to a defeat - after Pyrrhus, Greek king of Epirus who in defeating the Romans at Asculum in 279 BC suffered such losses that he commented 'one more such victory and Pyrrhus is undone'.Q.E.D. - as proven here - from the Latin 'quod erat demonstrandum', which literally means 'thus we have proved the proposition stated above as we were required to do'. Originally used by Greek mathematician Euclid, c.300 BC, when he appended the letters to his geometric theorems. He also used Q.E.F. ('quod erat faciendum') which meant 'thus we have drawn the figure required by the proposition'; for some reason this failed to come into any general use at all…quack - incompetent or fake doctor - from 'quack salver' which in the 19th century and earlier meant 'puffer of salves' (puff being old English for extravagant advertising, and salve being a healing ointment). Probably directly derived from German (quacksalber). Similar phrases existed in Dutch(quacken salf), Norweigian (qvak salver), and Swedish (qvak salfeare). Quacken was also old English for 'prattle'. 'Salve' originated from the Latin 'salvia' (meaning the herb 'sage'), which was a popular remedy in medieval times (5-15th century).quid - one pound sterling - from the Latin expression 'quid pro quo' (something in exchange for something).rabbit - talk a lotrag, tag and bob-tail - riff-raff, or disreputable people, also the name of the 1960's children's animated TV show about a hedgehog mouse, and rabbit - the derivation explains partly why the expression was used for a TV show about three cute animals: in early English, a 'rag' meant a herd of deer at rutting time; a 'tag' was a doe between one and two years old; and a 'bobtail' was a fawn just weaned (not a rabbit). The expression when originally used to mean a group of disreputable people was actually 'tag, rag and bobtail'; the order changed during the 20th century, and effectivelydisappeared from use after the TV show.take a rain check - postpone something - many believe this derives from the modern English meaning of 'check' (ie 'consider', or 'think about'), and so the expression is growing more to mean 'I'll think about it', but the original meaning stems from its derivation, which was from the custom started in 19th century America for vouchers to be issued to paying baseball spectators in the event of rain, which they would use for admission to the rearranged game.read the riot act - to rebuke strongly - from the Riot Act of 1716, whose terms stated that a group of twelve or more people must disperse if someone in authority read a portion of the act out loud to them. Apparently it was only repealed in 1973.caught red-handed - caught in the act of doing something wrong, or immediately afterwards with evidence showing, so that denial is pointless - the expression 'caught red-handed' has kept a consistent meaning for well over a hundred years (Brewer lists it in 1870). It's based simply on themetaphor of a murderer being caught with blood still on their hands, and therefore would date back probably to the days even before guns, when to kill another person would have involved the use of a direct-contact weapon like a dagger or club. The red-handed image is straightforward enough to have evolved from common speech, that is to say, there's unlikely to have been one single quote that originated the expression.red herring - a distraction initially appearing significant - from the metaphor of dragging a red (smoked) herring across the trail of a fox to throw the hounds off the fox's scent.red-letter day - a special day - saints days and holidays were printed in red as opposed to the normal black in almanacs and diaries.no/neither rhyme nor reason - a plan or action that does not make sense - originally meant 'neither good for entertainment nor instruction'. Thomas More (Henry VIII's chancellor 1529-32) received a book manuscript and suggested the author turn it into rhyme. On seeing the revised draft More noted the improvement saying 'tis rhyme now, but before it was neither rhyme nor reason'.riff-raff - common people - originally meant 'rags and sweepings' from Anglo-Saxon 'rief' meaning rag, and 'raff' meaning sweepings.ride roughshod over - to severely dominate or override something or someone - a 'roughshod' horse had nails protruding from the horseshoes, for better grip or to enable cavalry horses to inflict greater damage.ring of truth/ring true - sounds or seems believable - from the custom of testing whether coins were genuine by bouncing on a hard surface; forgeries not made of the proper precious metal would sound different to the real thing. 'Ring' is from the Anglo-Saxon 'hring-an', meaning ring a bell.when in Rome... (....do as the Romans do) - (when in a strange or different situation) it's best to behave (even if badly) like those around you - a great example of why these expressions endure for thousands of years: they are extremely efficient descriptions; they cram so much meaning into so few words. This expression originates from the Bible, when St Ambrose answers a question from St Augustine about what day he should fast, as different customs prevail in different cities. St Ambrose replies 'When I am in Milan, I do as they do in Milan; but when I go to Rome, I do as Rome does'.pass/cross the rubicon - commit to the point of no return - the Rubicon was a river separating ancient Italy from Cisalpine Gaul, which was allotted to Julius Caesar. When Caesar took his army across the river in 49 BC he effectively invaded Italy. See also 'the die is cast'.rubric - written instructions or explanation - from Latin 'rubrica' meaning the colour vermilion (red); adopted by the Romans to mean an 'ordinance' or 'law' because it was written in red.rule of thumb - general rule - from an old English law which made it illegal for a man to beat his wife with anything thicker than the width of his thumb.sackbut - trombone - similar expressions developed in French (saquebutte), Spanish (sacabuche) and Portuguese (saquebuxo), all based on the original Latin 'sacra buccina' meaning 'sacred trumpet'.salad days - youthful, inexperienced times (looked back on with some fondness) - from hakespeare's Anthony and Cleopatra; Cleopatra says 'My salad days, when I was green in judgement, cold in blood, to say as I said then'.sandwich - (the snack) - most will know that the sandwich is named after the Earl of Sandwich, 17th century, who ordered a piece of meat between two slices of bread so as not to have to interrupt another marathon card-playing session; the practice of eating in this way was not invented by Sandwich though, it dates back to Roman times.Satan - the devil - Satan means 'the enemy' in Hebrew.scapegoat - a person blamed for a problem - from the ancient Jewish annual custom, whereby two goats were brought before the alter of the tabernacle (place of worship) by the high priest on the Day of Atonement. Lots were drawn to determine which goat should be sacrificed. The surviving goat then had the sins of the priest and the people transferred to it by the priest's confession, after which it was taken into the wilderness and allowed to escape, hence 'scapegoat' ('scape' was a middle English abbreviation of 'escape' which is still a word but has disappeared from use).scarper - run awayup to scratch - meets the required standard - from the custom of scratching a line in the ground as a starting point for prize fighters, meaning that the contestants were ready and in the required position; the expression in earlier times was 'up to the scratch'.sea change - big significant change - from Shakespeare's The Tempest, when Ariel sings, 'Full fathom five thy father lies, Of his bones are coral made, Those are pearls that were his eyes, Nothing of him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea-change, into something rich and strange, Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell, Ding-dong. Hark! now I hear them, ding-dong, bell'.shoddy - poor quality - 'shoddy' originally was the fluff waste thrown off or 'shod' (meaning jettisoned or cast off, rather like shed) during the textile weaving process. The word then became the name of the material produced from fluff mixed with wool, or a material made from recycled garments. The early use of the expression was to describe a person of dubious or poor character.shoplift - steal from a shop - 'lift' derives from the Gothic 'hlifan', meaning to steal, originally from Latin 'levo', to disburden.silly - daft - originally from the German 'selig' meaning 'blessed' or 'holy', which was the early meaning of silly. The modern meaning developed because holy people were often considered gullible due to their innocence, therefore the meaning changed into 'foolish'. Interestingly, the 'silly season' originally described the time when newspapers resorted to filling their pages with nonsense while Parliament was in Summer recess, just as they still do today.son of a gun - an expression of surprise, particularly about somebody's action - although now an expression of surprise ("I'll be a son of a gun"), 'son of a gun' was originally a naval expression with two distinctly different meanings, each at least 150 years old: Firstly, a boy born from the union of a woman and sailor (of dubious or unknown identity) when the sailor's ship was in port. The suggestion was that the boy was conceived on board ship on the gun deck in seedy circumstances; the identity of the boy's father was not known, hence the boy was the 'son of a gun' - an insult to the mother as much as anything. Secondly, the expression referred to a boy born at sea, specifically on the gun deck. This meaning of the term was established in British Admiral William Henry Smyth's 'Sailor's Word Book' of 1865, when he described the expression: "An epithet applied to boys born afloat, when women were permitted to accompany their husbands to sea; one admiral declared he was thus cradled, under the breast of a gun carriage." The rhyming aspect, as with other expressions, would have helped establish the term into common use. It's also an alternative and seemingly more politevariation to the 'son of a bitch' term, although when you know the real history of 'son of a gun' it's arguably more insulting.sour grapes - when someone is critical of something unobtainable - from Aesop's fable about the fox who tried unsuccessfully to reach some grapes, and upon giving up says they were sour anyway.speedy Gonzales - a very quick person - some might remember the Warner Brothers Speedy Gonzales cartoon character; the original Speedy Gonzales was apparently a Mexican-American film studio animator, so called because of his regular lunchtime dash for carnal liaison with a girl in the paint and ink department.gone south, went south - failed (plan, business or financial venture) - almost certainly derived from the South Sea Scheme, also called the South Sea Bubble, stock scheme devised by Sir John Blunt from 1710-1720, which was based on buying out the British National Debt via investors paying £100 for a stake in exclusive South Seas trading rights. The shares soon increased in value by ten times, but 'the bubble burst' in 1720 and ruined thousands of people. The expression would have been further reinforced by the similar French scheme 1717-1720, based on paying the French national Debt, then totalling £208m, started by John Law, a Scot, which promised investors exclusive trading rights to Louisiana, on the banks of the Mississippi, central to USA southern states cotton trade, and the global textiles industry. 1870 Brewer confirms the South Sea Bubble term was used to describe any scheme which shows promise and then turns to ruin. South also has the meaning of moving or travelling down, which helps the appropriate 'feel' of the expression, which is often a factor in an expression becoming well established.spick and span - completely clean and in a new condition (normally describing a construction of some sort) - was originally 'spick and span new', and came from a shipbuilding metaphor, when a 'spic' was a spike or nail, and chip a piece of wood. The original expression meant that the thingwas new even down to these small parts.spinster - unmarried woman - in Saxon times a woman was not considered fit for marriage until she could spin yarn properly. Interestingly, and in similar chauvanistic vein, the word 'wife' derives from the Anglo-Saxon 'wyfan', to weave, next after spinning in the cloth-making process.square the circle - attempt the impossible - based on the mathematical conundrum as to whether a circle can be made with exactly the same area as a square, the difficulty arising from the fact that a circle's area involves the formula 'pi', which, while commonly rounded down to 3.14149, carries oninfinitely.steal someone's thunder - to use the words or ideas of another person before they have a chance to, especially to gain the approval of a group or audience - from the story of playwright John Dennis who invented a way of creating the sound of thunder for the theatre for his play Appius andVirginia in 1709. The play flopped but his thunder effect was used without his permission in a production of Macbeth. Dennis was said to have remarked 'They will not let my play run, but they steal my thunder'.stigma - a generally-held poor or distasteful view associated with something - from the Roman practice of branding slaves' foreheads; a 'stigma' was the brand mark, and a 'stigmatic' was a branded slave; hence 'stigmatise', which has come to mean 'give something an unlikeable image'. Originally from the Greek word 'stigma', a puncture.stipulate - state terms - from various ancient and medieval customs when a straw was used in contract-making, particularly in loan arrangements, and also in feudal England when the landowner would present the tenant with a broken straw to signify the ending of a contract. 'Stipula' is Latin for a straw.strike a bargain - agree terms - from ancient Rome and Greece when, to conclude a significant agreement, a human sacrifice was made to the gods called to witness the deal (the victim was slain by striking in some way).I swan - 'I swear', or 'I do declare' (an expression of amazement) - This is an American term, found mostly in the southern states. The modern spelling is derived from an old expression going back generations, probably 100-200 years, originating in East USA, originally constructed as 'Is wan'(pronounced ize wan), which was a shortening of 'I shall warrant', used - just like 'I swear' or 'I do declare' - to express amazement in the same way. Interestingly usage now is mostly by women - it certainly would not have been many years ago - perhaps because many now think that the expression derives from the word 'swoon', which is not a particularly manly activity.sycophant - a creepy, toady person who tries to win the approval of someone, usually in a senior position, through flattery or ingratiating behaviour - this is a truly wonderful derivation; from ancient Greece, when Athens law outlawed the exporting of figs; the law was largely ignored, but certainpeople sought to buy favour from the authorities by informing on transgressors. The informers were called 'suko-phantes' meaning 'fig-blabbers'. Wonderful…to a 'T' - exactly (fits to a T, done to a T, suits you to a T, etc) - Brewer lists this expression in 1870, so it was well established by then. Apparently from two origins, which would have strengthened the establishment of the expression (Brewer only references the latter origin, whichpersonally I think is the main one): Firstly it's a shortening of the expression 'to a tittle' which is an old English word for tiny amount, like jot. Secondly, it is a reference to something fitting as if measured with a T-square, the instrument used by carpenters, mechanics and draughtsmen tomeasure right-angles.teetotal - abstaining from alcohol - from the early English tradition for a 'T' (meaning total abstainer) to be added after the names (presumably on a register of some kind) of people who had pledged to abstain completely from alcohol. Similarly, people who had signed the abstinence pledge had theletters 'O.P.' (for 'Old Pledge') added after their names. A teetotum from the same period was an alcohol-free working man's club. Later, 'teetotum' was an American four-sided spinning-top used for gambling, the meaning derived here from the letter 'T' on one side which represented the total stake money).on tenterhooks - very anxious with expectation - a metaphor from the early English cloth-making process where cloth would be stretched or 'tentered' on hooks placed in its seamed edges. 'Tentered' derives from the Latin 'tentus', meaning stretched, which is also the origin of the word 'tent',being made of stretched canvas.through thick and thin - through good times and bad - from old 'thick and thin blocks' in a pulley mechanism which enabled rope of varying thickness to be used.thimble - finger protector used when sewing - from the original word 'thumb-bell'. Thimbles were invented in Holland and then introduced into England in 1695 by John Lofting's Islington factory. Sailors particularly wore thimbles on their thumbs.threshold - the beginning of something, or a door-sill - from the Anglo-Saxon 'thoerscwald', meaning 'door-wood'.thunderbolt - imaginary strike from above, or a massive surprise - this was ancient mythology and astronomy's attempt to explain a lightening strike, prior to the appreciation of electricity. The original ancient expression was 'thunderstone' which came from confusing thunder and lightening with meteor strikes and shooting stars, and was later superseded by 'thunderbolt' ('bolt' as in the short arrow fired from a cross bow). The word 'thunderbolt' gave rise directly to the more recent cliché meaning a big surprise, 'bolt from the blue' (blue being the sky).just/that's the ticket - that's just right (particularly the right way to do something) - from 'that's the etiquette' (that's the correct thing to do). See 'Etiquette'.tidy - orderly - late middle English from the word 'tide' (of the sea), the extension originally meaning things done punctually and methodically. The word 'tide' came from older European languages, derived from words 'Tid', 'tith' and 'tidiz' which meant 'time'. See 'time and tide wait for no man'.time and tide wait for no man - delaying a decision won't stop events overtaking you - Around 16th century the English word 'tide' became established in its own right, up until which it had been another word for 'time', so it's unlikely the expression originated prior to then. The original wording was 'tide nor time tarrieth no man' ('tarrieth' meaning 'waits for').tit for tat - retribution or retaliation, an exchange insults or attacks - 'tit for tat' evolved from 'tip for tap', a middle English expression for blow for blow, which also meant a trade of verbal insults. Tit is an old English word for tug or jerk. Tat evolved from tap partly because of the alliteration with tit, but also from the verbal argument aspect, which drew on the influence of the Middle English 'tatelen' meaning prattle, (Dutch tatelen meant stammer) which also gave rise to tittle-tattle. Tip and tapare both very old words for hit. (eg 'tip and run' still describes a bat and ball game when the player hits the ball and runs, as in cricket). Tit for tat was certainly in use in the mid-late 16th century. Tip for Tap was before this. As with lots of these old expressions, their use has been strengthened by similar sounding foreign equivalents, especially from N.Europe, in this case 'dit vor dat' in Dutch, and 'tant pour tant' in French. Skeat's 1882 dictionary of etymology references 'tit for tat' in 'Bullinger's Works' . Brewer in 1870 suggests for 'tit for tat' the reference 'Heywood', which must be John Heywood, English playwright 1497-1580 (not to be confused with another English playwright Thomas Heywood 1574-1641). According to James Rogers dictionary of quotes and cliches, John Heywood used the 'tit for tat' expression in 'The Spider and the Flie' 1556.tomboy - boyish girl - amazingly originally meant a harlot, nothing to do with boys or the name Tom, from 'romping girl', derived from Anglo-Saxon 'tumbere' meaning dancer or romper, from the same roots as the French 'tomber' (to tumble about). The corruption of the term into 'tomboy' then influenced the development of the modern meaning, largely through misinterpretation and mistaken use.grow like topsy - to grow without intention and probably without being noticed - from Harriet Beecher Stowe's 1850's book Uncle Tom's Cabin, in which a slave girl called Topsy suggests that as she had no mother of father 'I 'spects I growed'.Tories - political Conservative party and its members - the original Tories were a band of Irish Catholic outlaws in Elizabethan times. The word derived from the Irish 'toruigh', from 'toruighim', meaning to raid suddenly. This meaning seems to have converged with the Celtic words 'Taob-righ' ('king's party'), 'tuath-righ' ('partisans of the king') and 'tar-a-ri' ('come O king'). The Tory party first used the name in 1679. They began calling themselves 'Conservatives' in 1832, but the Tory name has continued to stick.touch and go - a close decision or narrow escape - from the days of horse-drawn carriages, when wheels of two vehicles might touch but no damage was done, meaning that both could go on their way.turncoat - someone who changes sides - one of the dukes of Saxony, whose land was bounded by France and England had a coat made, reversible blue and white, so he could quickly switch his show of allegiance.typhoon - whirlwind storm - from the Chinese 't'ai-fun', meaning the great wind. Typhoon was also an evil genius of Egyptian mythology.unkindest cut of all - a cruel or very unfortunate personal disaster - from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, when Mark Anthony says while holding the cloak Caesar wore when stabbed by Brutus, 'this was the most unkindest cut of all'.uproar - collective shouting or noisy complaining - nothing to do with roar, this is from the German 'auf-ruhren', to stir up.utopia - an unrealistically perfect place, solution or situation - from Sir Thomas More's book of the same title written in 1516; utopia actually meant 'nowhere' from the Greek, 'ou topos' (ou meaning not, topia meaning place), although the modern meaning is moving more towards 'perfect' rather than the original 'impossibly idealistic'.vandalism - deliberate damage to property - the Vandals were a German warrior race based south of the Baltic and prominent during the 5th and early 6th centuries. They invaded Spain in 409, crossing to Africa in 429, and under King Genseric sacked Rome in 455, where they mutilated publicmonuments. The early use of the term vandalism described the destruction of works of art by revolutionary fanatics.venison - meat of the deer - originally meant any animal killed in hunting, from Latin 'venatio', to hunt. Venison is mentioned in the Bible, when it refers to a goat kid.volume - large book - ancient books were written on sheets joined lengthways and rolled like a long scroll around a shaft; 'volume' meant 'a roll' from the Latin 'volvo', to roll up.warts and all - including faults - supposedly from a quote by Oliver Cromwell when instructing his portrait painter Peter Lely to paint a true likeness including '...roughness, pimples, warts and everything..'on the wagon/fall off the wagon - abstain from drinking alcohol (usually hard drink)/start drinking again after trying to abstain - both terms have been in use for around a hundred years. 'On the wagon', which cam first, is a shortened expression derived from 'on the water wagon'. Before paved and tarmac'd roads, water wagons used to spray the dirt roads to keep dust down, and anyone abstaining from hard liquor was said to be 'on the water wagon', no doubt because the water wagon presented a convenient alcohol-free icon. Vehicle-based cliches make for amusing metaphors although we now take them for granted - 'in the cart' (in trouble, from the practice of taking thecondemned to execution in a horse drawn cart); 'on your bike' (go away), 'get your skates on' (hurry up); 'get out of your pram' (get angry); off your trolley (mad or daft - not sure of this origin - possible the metaphor of a mad person dismounting from a hospital trolley?)whipping boy - someone who is regularly blamed or punished for another's wrong-doing - as princes, Edward VI and Charles I had boys (respectively Barnaby Fitzpatrick and Mungo Murray) to take their punishment beatings for them, hence 'whipping boy'. Around the same time Henry IV of France enjoyed the same privilege; his whipping boys D'Ossat and Du Perron later became cardinals.win hands down - win easily - from horse-racing, a jockey would relax and lower his grip on the horse's reins allowing the horse to coast past the finishing line; nowadays an offence that will earn the jockey a fine or ban, due to the effect on the result and therefore betting payouts.white elephant - something that turns out to be unwanted and very expensive to maintain - from the story of the ancient King of Siam who made a gift of a white elephant (which was obviously expensive to keep and could not be returned) to courtiers he wished to ruin. The original expression was 'to have a white elephant to keep', meaning to be burdened with the cost of caring for something very expensive.gone with the wind - irretrievably lost - although known best as the title of the epic film, the origin is the 1896 poem 'Non Sum Qualis Erum' (also known as Cynara) by Englishman Ernest Dowson (1867-1900): "I have forgot much, Cynara! Gone with the wind, Flung roses, roses, riotously, with the throng, Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind, But I was desolate and sick of an old passion, Yea, all the time, because the dance was long: I have been faithful to thee Cynara! in my fashion." Interestingly, in the same year Dowson also gave us 'the days of wine and roses', meaning past days of pleasure, in his poem 'Vitae Summa Brevis': "..They are not long, the days of wine and roses: Out of a misty dream, Our path emerges for a while, then closes, Within a dream." (Who needs to find a rhyming word when you can use the same one....)wormwood - bitter herbal plant - nothing to do with worms or wood; it means 'man-inspiriting' in Anglo-Saxon.worth his salt - a valued member of the team - salt has long been associated with a man's worth, since it used to be a far more valuable commodity than now (the Austrian city of Salzburg grew almost entirely from the wealth of its salt mines). The expression originates as far back as Roman times when soldiers' pay was given in provisions, including salt. The modern day version probably grew from the one Brewer references in 1870, 'true to his salt', meaning 'faithful to his employer'.the writing's on the wall - something bad is bound to happen - from the book of Daniel, which tells the story of the King of Belshazzar who sees the words of warning 'mene, mene, tekel, upharsin' written on the wall of the temple of Jesusalemen, following his feasting in the temple using its sacredvessels.yankee/yank - an American of the northern USA/European slang for an American - originally a corrupted interpretation by native American Indians of the words 'English' and the French 'Anglias' (also meaning 'English'), the former from 'yengees', 'yenghis', 'yanghis' to 'yankees'. The word 'yankee'first came into use by American Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam in early 18th century to describe English settlers, and then became a wider term for a New Englander. In the civil war the southern rebels extended the the term within the USA to mean the enemy from the northern states.xmas - christmas - x is the Greek letter 'chi', and the first letter of the Greek word 'christos' meaning 'anointed one'; first used in the fourth century.zeitgeist - mood or feeling of the moment - from the German, 'zeit' (time) and 'geist' (spirit).
