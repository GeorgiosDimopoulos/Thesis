   Subject: J1) Where can I get historical data of tropical cyclones? 
* 
FREE DATA
* HURDAT For more detailed information regarding the re-analysis of the Atlantic hurricane database (currently 1851 to 1885) surf to our HURDAT page. Provided by Chris Landsea. 
* Unisys The HURDAT information has be rendered into graphic form by Unisys Corporation and includes a track graphic as well as an ASCII listing for each storm since 1851. 
* NOAA Coastal Services Center NOAA's Coastal Services Center has put together a very nice interactive website which allows the user to search the HURDAT data base by location. You may select a major city or latitude and longitude and find how many storms of a particular strength and over particular ranges of time and proximity have approached that point. 
* 
NOT-FREE DATA
* World Weather Disc ($295): Monthly temp, precip, pressure, sunshine data for about 2000 world stations for period of record. Daily weather data at hundreds of US stations. Data for some stations on temp, precip, freeze, drought, soil moisture, wind, storms. Frequency and movement of tropical cyclones. Contact:

* Global Tropical and Extratropical Cyclone Climatic Atlas (GTECCA) 2.0 CD-ROM: This single volume CD-ROM contains global historic tropical storm track data for five tropical storm basins. Period of record vary for each basin, beginning as early as the 1870's, with 1995 as the latest year. Northern hemispheric extratropical storm track data are included from 1965 to 1995. Tropical track data includes time, position, storm stage (maximum wind, central pressure when available). The user has the capability to display tracks, and to track data for any basin or user-selected geographic area. The user is also able to select storm tracks passing within a user-defined radius of any point. Narratives for all tropical storms for the 1980-1995 period are included along with basin-wide tropical storm statistics.
