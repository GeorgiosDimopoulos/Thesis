This Month Cover Story	
 

Spanish fortune
 Published on:  02 December, 2003 

SpainÂ’s finance minister, Rodrigo Rato, talks to Karina Robinson about the governmentÂ’s continued efforts in transforming the country into a dynamic European front player.

Â‘Â‘If a few years ago someone had said that Iberia would perform better than Swissair, I wouldnÂ’t have believed it. Or that Banco Popular would be admired by all. Or that while France and Germany perform worse than others, Spain is doing well,Â’Â’ says Javier Valls, chairman of Madrid-based Banco Popular. Europe no longer stops at the Pyrenees, as that oft-used phrase had it a few decades ago. Not only is Iberia posting profits while Swissair went bankrupt a couple of years ago, but Spain also boasts world-class banks such as Banco Popular, BBVA and Santander Central Hispano, world-class corporations like TelefÃ³nica and oil company Repsol, while its adherence to fiscal rectitude Â– resulting in an AAA rating Â– has produced stronger growth than many of its northern neighbours.

RussiaÂ’s latest space race
 Published on:  02 December, 2003 

Funds are rushing to get a slice of RussiaÂ’s property pie before the limited supply of top quality buildings dries up. Ben Aris reports. 

The leading Russian Trading System index sailed through its all time high of 571 on October 9 to 637.77. With RussiaÂ’s blue chips already trading at fair value, investors are looking for news ways to get some exposure to RussiaÂ’s ballistic growth.

Are banks fulfulling their moral role?
 Published on:  02 December, 2003 

There is growing concern that VenezuelaÂ’s banks are ignoring their private credit portfolios and relying instead on government paper, says Mike Ceaser.
What happens when a nationÂ’s banking system loses all of its customers except one? When that nation is Venezuela, and the customer is the government, the banks thrive. But the morals of this tactic and its effect on the nationÂ’s economy are being questioned.

Â“Not having access to international markets, which had a very high cost, the state turned to the internal marketÂ”
