On patents and piracy  
Today I was discussing the matter of piracy with some intellectual friends of mine and we shared (almost 4 votes to 1) a common solution to the problem. Actually the reason of the discussion was not software-piracy but more related to the music industry.Patents today are out of date and don't meet up with their creational idea. The main question is how and when did the modern states reconsider and evaluate the time before patents is invalidated. What I can see this period has only to become longer, this is unacceptable and is a direct consequence of the layback governments which don't dare to disagree with the main actors on the market. Ofcourse Sony lobbies the music copyright to gain more money as do Microsoft with software patents and Intel with hardware, Astra-zeneca with medical patents and the list goes on and on. Would you be surprised if the valid times where a tiny bit too long?Who consider the development and the need for justified patent times? Currently, I would say no-one. There is only one actor protecting our rights the lawbreakers. A sorry fact. posted by Jens Berlips at 6:01 PM 0 comments   
It is a happy day today  
After reading this article from Dagens Nyheter I found myself rather upset. The reason for this sudden reaction on my side lies in the fact that 19 technician where to perform a raid against the company (Bahnhof Internet). A simple approximated calculation shows, assuming that this "mission" takes our government agency aobut 8 hours (one full day) and that each techician earn about $100/hr, that the cost is 19*8*100 = $15200 for this "mission". The where loooking for as much as four movies and 8 mp3 songs! Wow! Why am I not impressed.I feel sorrow for all our tax-payers who all can see their money disappear in something this silly.[edit: not working: So exactly why is this a happy day? Well watch www.antipiratbyran.com and enjoy! Here you can read some e-mail correspondation between some of the main characters in the Swedish anti-piracy agency (and it is not that pretty).]gr33ts to AUH posted by Jens Berlips at 12:23 AM 0 comments
