Paul A. Cleveland and Jared R. Price 'The Failure of FAA Regulation' is a valuable point of view... 
  

The recent attacks against the United States raised several questions concerning our national security. The government's main purpose according to the U.S. Constitution is to provide for national defense. Therefore, how was it that hijackers were able to compromise the nation's security with box cutters at a time when the federal government had spent $1.5 trillion over the past five years for military purposes (Higgs 2002)? The answer can be found in the bureaucracy of the Federal Aviation Administration. Not only has the FAA compromised the nation's security, but it has also been the unseen source of flight delays and airline inefficiencies. The FAA was created in 1958 to insure aviation safety and to provide a nationalized system of air traffic control. However, over its long history it has become a federal bureaucracy that compromises safety and hinders the incorporation of new technology in the industry. The regulations imposed by the FAA have not only failed to keep Americans safe, but have cost Americans countless delays due to the inefficiencies created by an overly bureaucratic system. continue->
