Frankie Dunn (CLINT EASTWOOD) has trained and managed some incredible fighters during a lifetime spent in the ring. The most important lesson he teaches his boxers is the one that rules his life: above all, always protect yourself. In the wake of a painful estrangement from his daughter, Frankie has been unwilling to let himself get close to anyone for a very long time. His only friend is Scrap (MORGAN FREEMAN), an ex-boxer who looks after Frankie's gym and knows that beneath his gruff exterior is a man who has attended Mass almost every day for the past 23 years, seeking the forgiveness that somehow continues to elude him. Then Maggie Fitzgerald (HILARY SWANK) walks into his gym. Maggie's never had much, but there is one thing she does have that very few people in this world ever do: she knows what she wants and she's willing to do whatever it takes to get it. In a life of constant struggle, Maggie's gotten herself this far on raw talent, unshakable focus and a tremendous force of will. But more than anything, what she wants is for someone to believe in her. The last thing Frankie needs is that kind of responsibility - let alone that kind of risk. He tells Maggie the blunt hard truth: she's too old and he doesn't train girls. But 'no' has little meaning when you have no other choice. Unwilling or unable to give up on her life's ambition, Maggie wears herself to the bone at the gym every day, encouraged only by Scrap. Finally won over by Maggie's sheer determination, Frankie begrudgingly agrees to take her on. In turns exasperating and inspiring each other, the two come to discover that they share a common spirit that transcends the pain and loss of their pasts, and find in each other a sense of family they lost long ago. What they don't know is that soon they will both face a battle that's going to demand more heart and courage than any they've ever known.Warner Bros.

Race Strategy  
Wow. When I went online yesterday I thought the counter was somewhere around 5490. 60 hits in 24 hours? Today I got up early, but after breakfast slept through most of the morning. I feel like my body really needed it. I am starting to feel that sense of wanting to do things out of energy cravings, rather than because I should.Today I had a light salad for lunch, though have been snacking on rolls and stuff when I get hungry. Am trying to ban coke till Race Day, let's see how that goes.I went to George's Pool and Newton Park pool and took some photos and swam a bit too. Newton Park brought back a few memories, but I guess when the lane lines aren't in, it takes on a different look and feel.I also went to the airport in the Humewood shuttle to fetch my bike. I am going to take a taxi to Action Cycles in Walmer tomorrow to swap the bullhorns for the aerobars, and get the cables and gears sorted out. I will probably cycle again tomorrow after that, 60km or so, and do a 1 lap (1.9km) swim in the sea. I'll run 10km on Thursday and then just relax towards the weekend.My race strategy still feels and sounds weird to me:Comofortable swim: probably around 1:05.Going to jog easily into the transition, drink something, calmly get on the bike.I'm going to try to average 30km/h on the bike, but if I start feeling tired, am going to back off. Bike may be around 6 hours, but if I feel kak I'll take as long as 7, stopping for water and stuff, especially if the wind picks up. There is a gradual 14km hill climb, which I have to do 3 times.The Run. I have no ideas what my legs will feel like after the 180km bike. I'm going to just jog easily when I feel strong, hopefully for the first 20km and then run in bits and pieces. My initial goal was under 10 hours, now I think I'd like to go under 12 if I'm even in that area. If not, then between 12 and 13 hours. If things unravel like crazy I will forget all concepts of space and time and just concentrate on energy and effort, forward moving, feet in front of each other, and try to spread myself over the full distance. The highest priority is simply to FINISH. Time is secondary.Over the next few days I want to get my head into the right space because I will need to concentrate and be focussed if I'm going to successfully drive my body for 12 hours or more. So I want to have a few private chats and pep talks with myself between now and Race Day. This is to get myself into a Positive Headspace.Finally I want to make sure I stay away from sugars, and not have my weight fluctuate either up or down over the next few days.My mantra for Race Day: Keeping going, smooth and slow...keep going, smooth and slow... posted by Nick at 1:04 AM 0 comments

Race Weather  
The UV index is 8, which is very high, so will need to slap on sunblock with a very high SPF. Wind looks like it's only going as high as 18km/h. See how that works out.Maximum temperature is predicted to be 27 degrees Celcius. Seems like a pretty good day right there... posted by Nick at 12:50 AM 0 comments
