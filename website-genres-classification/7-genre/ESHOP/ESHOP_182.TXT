In 1999 Pulse Design Ltd was established to service a growing need to supply bespoke computer services in the UK. As the market grew we identified that internet sales were a way of promoting our range of computers and very competitive prices to a global market, therefore allowing the end user to benefit from discounts normally available to business. Hence the creation of UK Computer Parts.
