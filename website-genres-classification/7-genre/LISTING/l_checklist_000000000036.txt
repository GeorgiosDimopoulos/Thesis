Fine Points Checklist
=====================================================================
 
This page is to help you look at the aesthetic fine points of your page and pinpoint the little things to fix that will make your good pages into great ones. You can use it to look at your own project or you can ask someone else to provide you with a peer review. Any line that doesn't have Yes checked suggests that there might be something to fix. Each item is keyed to the appropriate section of the Fine Points page.
