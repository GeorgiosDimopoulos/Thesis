   Subject: E7) Which tropical cyclones have caused the most deaths and most damage? 
"The death toll in the infamous Bangladesh Cyclone of 1970 has had several estimates, some wildly speculative, but it seems certain that at least 300,000 people died from the associated storm tide [surge] in the low-lying deltas." (Holland 1993) 
The largest damage caused by a tropical cyclone as estimated by monetary amounts has been Hurricane Andrew (1992) as it struck the Bahamas, Florida and Louisiana, USA: US $26.5 Billion. However, if one normalizes hurricane damage by inflation, wealth changes and coastal county population increases, then the worst is no longer Hurricane Andrew, but is instead the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane. If this storm hit in the mid-1990s, it is estimated that it would cause over $70 BILLION in South Florida and then an additional $10 BILLION in the Florida panhandle and Alabama (Pielke and Landsea 1998).
