Bookish games
I picked this up from the brilliant Vanessa, who in turn got it from here. The idea in that you cross out any author NOT represented on your bookshelves and replace it with one who is. Have a go in the comments box or your own blog. Here's my effort, glancing at the shelves on my left.1. Iain Pears Bret Easton Ellis2. John Irving Evelyn Waugh3. Alice Munro Dorothy L. Sayers4. Barbara Hodgson Gerald of Wales5. Elizabeth George John Buchan6. Nick Bantock Kingsley Amis7. Ruth Rendell Tibor Fischer8. Anne Tyler Matthew Parris9. Margaret Atwood (present, but unopened)10. Leif Enger Octave Mirebeau11. Agatha Christie12. Graham Greene13. Ann Patchett Iain Sinclair14. Azar Nafisi Gabriel Chevallier15. Donna Leon Ronald FirbankHmm. Not many women there - wonder what that means.

Thank God for strong drink
Just back from a long week, conducting 'workshops' of the non-boiler-suited kind. Weariness on Tuesday, ritual humiliation on Wednesday, success and laughter as soon as I stopped caring. I left my gloves in King's Lynn, my trousers in Great Yarmouth and my soul in Liverpool. A conversation, overheard on the stretch between Norfolk and Nuneaton. Two Asian guys, about 30, one cultivating emphysema and the other narcolepsy. In between the one's coughing fits and the other's catnaps..."He went to college?""Yeah. He ain't been back to see his family except at Christmas. And summer.""No way. How'd he get to college?""He went to some college in Birmingham. They sorted him out with a qualification."Pause, cough, sleep, pause and pause and cough some more.Then: "Can you drink and drive a train?""It's not like a road, man. You just have to make sure you don't come off the tracks."

I would have defended her
In the pub. Middle aged man and woman propped on a pair of bar stools, leaning on elbows, facing each other. Man is speaking:"There was a time I would have defended her. It's not shy. It's not reserved. It's...""It's German arrogance."

Not even Dunlop
My head is temporarily out of the bog. Over the next few weeks, as I tour a combination of charmed cities and post-industrial shitholes, I will have little chance to plunge it back in.You remember the Monty Python sketch in which the northerners tried to out-pov each other? You know, the we-used-to-have-to-get-out-of-the-lake-at-three-o'clock-in-the-morning-clean-the-lake-eat-a-handful-of-hot-gravel one? Well, I heard the local version on the bus today.Man and a child sitting behind me. "I didn't have a coat. I used to have to go out in the rain in my t-shirt.""Yeah?""And I didn't have trainers. Not Nike, not Adidas. Not even Dunlop."Giggle"Oh, so you think it's funny do you? Well it wasn't for me. I had to wear plastic sandals. They were broken. All the kids at school used to laugh and call me a tramp."Giggle"You've got it easy. We didn't have nothing. No Ben Sherman, no Burberry, no Aquascutum, no... (etc, etc)"The last time I came across so many designer names in a sentence was when I last read American Psycho.

Bogged down
Continuing the relatively abstemious season, I've had my head hovering over the bog seat for the last week or so; but this time I've been teaching myself how to develop black and white prints. Sooner or later I will have absorbed quite enough developer, stop bath and fixer and will be back. Probably tomorrow.

See See TV
Being a CCTV operator must be a voyeur's dream. Not only do you get a ringside seat for the latest stabbing, shooting or murder, but can play games like 'spot the nose-picking pedestrian'.Indeed, there's so much scope for entertainment, I'd question whether the camera near Topps Tiles on Stamford Hill really ought to be pointed at the lighted windows of the flats opposite. Or am I being cynical in thinking that there is a bunch of pervs in the control room, using their equipment to stake out a bit of raw flesh?I expect the camera's just broken. This is Hackney after all.

Circumcision is no more
Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth;
for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
They speak vanity every one with his neighbor:
with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak
Psalms 12, 1-2There's not much percentage in converting the Jews these days. The bottom has dropped out of the market. But, as I've mentioned once or twice before, one of my favourite local characters is an avid believer in the sport.So it was with delight that, after failing to secure any mousetraps in a nearby hardware shop, I saw my old friend was at his post. My other half was in Safeway's securing a bit of cheese and an apple or two, so I hung around outside and waited for the preacher man to map out my path to salvation.He was superb. So I whipped out the notebook and got scribbling. And sure enough, along came gem number one:The people who translated the Scripture. They LIED about it! God was so ANGRY he visited them in 12 HOURS!Superb: the old God-was-misquoted angle. But the next offering would have got the chap burnt in the Middle Ages, and on a windy day like this it would be rather unpleasant to see his melted fat adorning the walls of the supermarket.God didn't create the world! His son JESUS did it!Steady on! When did he do that then? After he was born, or before?But my friend is not a man to stick to a topic if he can help it. He dives into his text every minute or two, drinks in inspiration and starts afresh on a new exegesis. As I headed home, the last I heard was:God thought it better for man to lose his foreskin than his freedom. But since the days of Adam, circumcision IS NO MORE!When he gets lynched, I'm going to miss this man.
