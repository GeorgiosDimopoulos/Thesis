Search Tips

Take advantage of Teoma's three types of responses:        
        
1.  Results: Highly authoritative web pages relevant to your search.         

2.  Refine: Suggestions to narrow your search to specific topics.         

3.  Resources :         These web pages contain collections of links about general subjects related to your search. They are compiled by topic experts and enthusiasts from around the world.

In addition, they often categorize and provide editorial comments on the web links they list, serving as information resource pages. 

For example, search         for search engine         at Teoma:         

4.  The left column of Teoma's result page gives popular web search sites.         
5.  On the top of the right column are suggested refinements to focus your search.         
6.  Under the suggested refinements are resource pages containing summaries and         site listings for all kinds of search engines on the web.         
                

Tips on typing search terms on             Teoma:            	                           
        
         
* Input terms to specify that          result pages contain all of these terms. 

Example : new york          restaurants 
                  

* Use quotations or a dash without          space to specify a phrase. You can also use the checkbox next to "Find this phrase." Teoma          returns results which exactly match the given phrase.          
Example : "George P Bush" or George-P-Bush 

* The search engine may omit some common words such as "the" or "what." To include these words in a search, add a "+" sign in front of each word you want included. Make sure there is a space before the "+".
Example : +the +who rock music
          

* You can also use a "-" sign before a term to specify that a result page must not contain the term.
Example: apple -computer will return pages that must          contain the word "apple" and do not contain the word "computer."
                   

* Be specific.          
Example: If you are looking for the subway map for Milan Italy, type in subway map Milan Italy not subway maps          
Example: If you are looking for Honda cars, type in Honda cars rather than cars
                   
* Different word stems or endings can lead to different results. Try all endings.          
Example: cat will get different results than cats           
Example: running a marathon will get different results than run a marathon
                   
* Check your spelling. Teoma looks for exactly what you type in.
