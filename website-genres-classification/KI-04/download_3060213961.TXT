Note that you need to install support for Windows Media Audio (WMA) in case you want to try Microsofts new MP3 competitor format (.wma) with Audiograbber. You can use either Sonique or Winamp to play WMA files so get the latest version of one of them and at the same time get the WMA encoder that works in Audiograbber. (A full installation of Sonique or Winamp also installs the WMA encoder).

If you want to store the free audiograbber (agfreesetup.exe) on your own server then you are allowed to do that as long as you are not linking to any cracks or warez sites. I would even appreciate it since it will lower the bandwidth usuage on my own server. If you want a more formal permission then send me a request at jackie@audiograbber.com-us.net.
