Who am I ?

I was born March 11th 1973 in Douala (Cameroon). That's where I went to school. With most of my curriculum in french.  I arrived in Germany (Berlin) in December 1991 for Studies and have been doing so since then. I'll graduate next month in as an electrical engineer specialised in the field of telecommunications.

Hobbies

Well my main hobby is sports. I love watching soccer with my team the "Indomitable Lions of Cameroon" on the pitch. I believe they are currently the best soccer team in the world and I'm sure you'll revide your definition of playing soccer the day you'll see them in action. And guess what ? They're olympic champion, african champion and next summer they'll be crowned "Kings of the World" by winning the world championship in Japan/Corea Personnaly I practice a sport called CAPOEIRA, It's a kind of african martial arts desguised as dancing. You can find more information on capoeira here.  Apart from those, I also do a bit of the usual stuff like reading, partying, movies etc. Back
