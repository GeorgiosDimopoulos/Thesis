Battling With Sanity...

Smoking's bad for you, apparently  
I keep reading about other people giving up smoking and as soon as I read the, "I haven't smoked since...", I suddenly feel the need to spark up on their behalf. I'm going to give up smoking soon too. The second week of the impending school holidays.One of the most annoying things in the World is those preacher types who suck in their breath and say, "Ooh, you shouldn't smoke, it's very bad for you". Well, fuck me, really??? As if those half the packet sized warnings on every packet of cigarettes isn't enough information. Thank you, I can read. I only ever smoke in the garden so it's not like my smoking has any direct effects on anyone else. A friend of mine gave me the old, "You should quit" speech last week and it wasn't very well received. I pointed out that, as a very regular binge drinker that dabbles in recreational drugs, he might like to rethink his preaching platform.I can tell it's about time to quit though because when those commercials come to TV (you know the type, the globs of fat falling out of the cigarettes, etc) I have to either change channels immediately or cover my eyes and sing very loudly, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah". I'm a great believer in ignorance being bliss.When those Sudan1 warnings were all over the place a couple of weeks ago, I was fretting until I realised, being a smoker, it's a bit stupid worrying about the small chance of being affected by that when I pose myself an even greater risk several times a day. Hmm.

Silly girl...  
I have picked nuts, of course. Chestnuts and things. Ooh and that time I shimmied up a tree to get that coconut.Why can't I sleep, again?

Nutty  
Where do nuts grow? I'd like to pick some. I'll have to put it on my to do list. Maybe Jeeves will know.

Daft Dollop  
When I was in Malaysia I kept asking my brother to stick a bit of plaster over a mole on my back. One of the days I forgot to take my mandatory teensy bit of plaster to cover it with so he put a blob of suncream on it. I asked him if it was properley covered (one has to be careful, I feel). He said what sounded like, "You great white dollop". Apparently what he actually said was, "Yes, a great big dollop". Anyway, it amused me and ever since I've been calling people dollops.Last night, I was in the kitchen with my mum who was visiting from Somerset, cooking dinner. I turned around to get something but once I'd turned, I forgot what it was that I turned for (ugh, I hate it when that happen and it happens far too frequently that it should for someone my age). Anyway, I had to turn back in the opposite direction to negate the initial turn so ending up spinning silly circles around the kitchen. She thinks I'm mad, again.I went shopping today. I swore I absolutely wouldn't buy anything because I'm seriously overdrawn. I came home with three tops, a cardigan (well, there's a cold front due next week and I don't want to get nippy!), a pair or earrings (that match the skirt I bought last week), a bracelet (sooo pretty), toe nail clippers (shouldn't really bite them, I'm told it's mangy) and nail files (one has to keep one's nails short during this guitar learning phase).Speaking of chewing toe nails, small child was sat at the table the other night, eating his dinner whilst scratching his head with his foot. I think he's very odd. Still, if you can't beat them, join them.

Shiny and New!  
I got sick of looking at white so I've changed my template. I intend doing more to it but I need to learn more html first. I want to add those hovery bits to the links but I seem to have forgotten how. Oh, and there's new links too, check them out.I came across this this morning. I quite like Blur but it still make me chuckle.

I accompanied my friend to the crematorium on Sunday. It was really sad. They have a little Rememberence Chapel and, in there, people had left cards and beautiful flowers for their absent loved ones. There were people circulating the room reading these cards that had been left and were getting obviously upset as they were reading other people's private messages. I thought this was a bit odd. It's like rubber necking on other people's grief. I'd like to have been nosey too but I'm not entirely sure it's very moral. If I was leaving a card, I'd leave it in the envelope.

I've come across a couple of good blogs this morning, that I'll be popping in the right hand bar.This new laptop's been causing me no end of problems. I'm not in love with it after all. Internet Explorer either crashes or just doesn't open at all, I can't find any decent software to download music that doesn't install all manner or spyware onto my computer and the touch pad drives me mad!! I sit here, typing away, only to realise my hand's accidentally made contact with the touch pad (again) and the cursor has zipped off to God only knows where (again). Also, some of the keys are in places where I'm not used to them being. Since when does the delete key belong at the bottom, below the shift key?? Ugh. I suspect I might be turning into Victor Meldrew.

My new laptop is here!!! My life is now complete and I'm very happy indeed (despite the banging headache and cold that small child has kindly passed on to me).

Things were a bit fizzy in my house last night. I accidentally electrocuted myself. I'm not entirely sure why I feel the need to add "accidentally". I can't imagine anyone would do that sort of thing on purpose.My poor laptop is leaving me today. Last week I dropped it (or, fell down the stairs with it, for insurance company purposes). There was much discussing of whether they'd fix the case of replace it. Anyway, the upshot is that I was told to ensure I got a new one I should drop it from about the height of my head. It was a very sad evening indeed. Today I'm in mourning, wearing all black (unless you happen to notice I'm wearing my nightie under my jumper, in which case the illusion is shattered.

It's been drawn to my attention that rather allot of people come to this website having searched in google for unrequited love. Whyever would that be found here? What was even more freaky was that someone has come here by googling my full name +birthday. Why? What's more, how do they even know my name? Where does it say my name? Is this page not anonymous??

Sharing a toilet with a young boy is something that I find really unpleasant. When in my own house I don't always remember to inspect the toilet before I sit down and a few times a week I end up sitting in wee. Totally disgusting, as you can imagine. Yesterday was a classic. I wander upstairs to have a quick wee and end up almost falling down the toilet. So, finally he gets the hang of lifting up the toilet seat before he wees and I'm still not happy. Instead of sitting in wee, I'm now in danger of falling down the toilet. Some mother's are never happy and the training must continue.Expect to see me washed up on a beach in the near future.

I'm online looking for opera tickets for a mother's day present. This year we're going to see either La Traviata, Carmen or something else that I forget the name of. Anyway, I keep getting sidetracked by pointless things. An hour, I've just spent, looking for the silly car parts in the games section. Clearly I have too much time on my hands. Actually, I should get a start on the housework and dinner. I have a guitar lesson tonight. I anticipate sore finger tips again in the morning.

I was thinking yesterday how well I've been doing with not going shopping since Malaysia and that maybe I'm not so terrible with money after all but I'd conveniently forgotten to take into account the mail order shopping I've been doing lately, in place of going out in real life and doing real life shopping (we're going to gloss over that trip to W S Smiths the other day when I came out with six massive bags of shopping...). There's cowboys boots and belts and a skirt, oh and a belt and then that other belt. Oh bugger. I really am crap.

Yay!!  
Hoorah, my laptop's home! I've spent half my morning dashing to the door to collect parcels. The first one was those poxy bubbly envelope thingies, the second a belt and yay, thrid time lucky, my beloved laptop. My life is complete once more. So, here I am, lounging in bed (am coming down with something, not just being lazy - honest! My head's going to explode soon, I think) on my wonderful laptop. I think I might give it a name. Oooh, and I can upload more music to my iPod now too. The World is a wonderful place once more.Incidently, I was a bit peeved that this snow business didn't last long. The small child and I walked to school this morning, got up extra early so we could play in it. We only built half a snowman thinking we could build a larger one after school and look what's happened; It's melted!!! Where is the justice, I ask you? He made me laugh though, the whole way to school he was gathering snow to make a snowball and by the time we reached the gates it was about half the size of him. He wasn't allowed to take it in for show and tell.

Erm, this website is a joke, right?? Someone having an unfunny laugh? People don't really keep those kittens in jars, do they?

I was reading on someone's blog this morning that catching snow in your mouth is painful (I forget where I read it, I'll find out and post it later) so I had a go on the way to and from the shops earlier and it was fine. A teensy bit nippy perhaps, but not at all uncomfortable. This snow today has been daft, it looks like someone's been chucking a load of polystyrene about.

I'm finally back from Somerset, minus my bloody laptop!!! How could I possibly forget it?? Now I'm going to have to have it couriered back to me. I'm lost without iTunes and this computer's too shite for my iPod. I miss it already. Blooming computer freak.

(Okay, so I haven't ever got around to writing a description. The very idea leaves me conversationally stumped. However, a friend has very kindly written one for me): Slightly quirky but highly adorable 25 year young mum of extremely cute 6 year old little boy. Has ability to converse on any subject and great inability to make animal noises and regional accents! Open minded, friendly and good hearted. Avid reader. Loves the flicks. Enjoys swimming and sometimes wishes she'd been born a mermaid.
