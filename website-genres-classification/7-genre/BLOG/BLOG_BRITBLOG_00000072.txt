awkward silence  
"excuse me..I dropped my pen." LOL that always makes me laugh. That is a reference to one of my all-time favorite films, Wayne's World. Funny because I am consumed by my own thoughts of worldly and spiritual contemplation, but when I watch movies, I hate realism.I feel just like Garth right now when faced with the prospect of change. I am sure everyone has had that "writers block" of sorts when writing a journal or writing what others may read. The thought of an understanding person reading my innermost thoughts just doesn't come to mind. Unfortunately,I picture an antagonist, a nay-sayer...but honestly I think that's self-deprecating.That may be realistic to assume that, but even that really is ok.Right now I am just going to have to come back to you little blog. I have dinner to clean up and kids to wash and put to bed. Hopefully if I can, this will be my time capsule of my thoughts, worries, insights, and habits of this time in my life. Perhaps someone can glean something from this as well.
