To everything, turn, turn, turn, turn.
There is a season, turn, turn, turn.
And a time for every purpose under heaven.
A time to build up, a time to break down.
A time to dance, a time to mourn.
A time to cast away stones.
A time to gather stones together.
Book of Ecclesiastes,
The Byrds

In case anyone is wondering, the verse at the top of the page is from "Turn, Turn, Turn" by The Byrds. I love that song. But anyway, on to the business at hand. Proceed to the Welcome section when you're ready . . . any time now . . . 
Note: this is a watered down version of my website. I couldn't figure out how to upload the real thing, so this'll have to do ... for now .... 
If you have a minute, go visit the St. Patricks' Spire Restoration homepage - it's a great cause!
