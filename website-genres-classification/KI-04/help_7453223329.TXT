General questions 

Q What is it? 

A The euro is the name given to the single currency of the European Union. According to the European Commission the euro will exist as a currency from 1 January 1999 but will only gradually move into general use, with the introduction of coins and notes in 2002. For more information see the Euro Web site run by the European Commission. 

Q Should the word 'euro' be capitalized? Is the plural form 'euro' or 'euros'? 

A The form varies depending on language. In English 'euro' and 'cent' should not be capitalized, and the plural forms should not include an 's' in official documents. 

An official EU dossier [Adobe pdf format] lists singular and plural forms for each European language. This document notes that the spelling without an 's' may be seen as departing from usual English spelling for currencies. According to a (London) Daily Telegraph report the Bank of England will use 'euros'. 

Q What does the symbol look like, and how was it chosen? 

A According to the information posted on the euro Web site, about thirty draft designs were drawn up internally by the European Commission. The general public assessed ten designs, narrowing the shortlist to two. Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, and Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the European commissioner in charge of the euro chose the final design. euro in Arial, Times New Roman and Courier New 

Q Why do the symbols shown above look different from the one posted on the official euro site?

A We have chosen to make instances of the euro symbol font and style specific. The design of the symbol takes on the characteristics of the font in which it resides. 

Traditionally numerals and currency symbols are the same width for any given font. This helps values line up properly in tabular applications like spreadsheets. To make the euro symbol the correct width for Arial and Times New Roman it had to be condensed. 

Unicode and codepage assignments 

Q What is the symbol's Unicode assignment? 

A The euro character is encoded in the Unicode Standard as U+20AC EURO SIGN. To avoid confusion, the historical character U+20A0 EURO-CURRENCY SIGN has been updated with an informative note and a cross reference to U+20AC EURO SIGN. See the Unicode Consortium's Unicode Technical Report # 8 for more details. 

Q What is the symbol's Windows codepage location? 

A The symbol has been added to the following codepages at position '0x80'; 1250 Eastern European, 1252 Western, 1253 Greek, 1254 Turkish, 1257 Baltic, 1255 Hebrew, 1256 Arabic, 1258 Vietnamese, 874 Thai. In 1251 Cyrillic the symbol will be added at position '0x88'. Other codepages are controlled by governments or standards bodies. Microsoft is working with these organizations on the placement of the euro.
