Weight Watch &#8216;05
March 14th, 2005               
I weighed myself this morning for the first time in ages. I&#8217;ve been off training for 3 months owing to an injury sustained just before christmas (which will be familiar to anyone who read my Tough Guy training log) and was not that surprised to see that I&#8217;m now 15 stone - over half a stone heavier than I was last year.
At my height, that&#8217;s a B.M.I value of 27. Now while I don&#8217;t set a lot of store in B.M.I., it is an indicator and, frankly, that&#8217;s poor. (between 20 and 25 is considered ideal and 30+ is clincally obese). The average weight for someone my height is actually 13st 5lbs (85kg) so that&#8217;s about a stone and a half I&#8217;d need to lose to get down to my average weight (which would give me a B.M.I. value of 24.)
At a sensible weight loss rate of 2lbs per week, I could hit that target by the end of May. Now that&#8217;s quite aggressive but fortunately, I am quite keen to get fit again and as I can&#8217;t lift heavy weights, I&#8217;m going to concentrate on running far more with a goal of doing Tough Guy again on the 31st July. 
Now all this might sound quite vain and you&#8217;d be half right. But the main reason I need to lose weight is because I&#8217;m stingy. I can&#8217;t get into most of the trousers I own so rather than go out and buy new pairs, I&#8217;m going to cut back on the family bucket of fried chicken, the industrial size pizzas and refrain from drinking more beer than is produced by some developing countries. Tie that in with running and some low resistance, high rep gym work and the lard will melt off. 
Plus I actually would like to finish a 5km race in under 45 mins this year!

Six Nations: Week 4
March 14th, 2005               
I should have been up in Edinburgh yesterday with Huwge and Briggy but somehow we never managed to arrange it. Good thing for Briggy I think as Wales sliced through Scotland in one of the most impressive games of rugby this otherwise lacklustre Six Nations has seen this year. Certainly there was some sparkling play by Wales which lead to an early 20 point lead in the first 15 minutes of the game but Scotland showed in the second half that they shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated and also played some great rugby in a good comeback but it wasn&#8217;t enough to stop the boyos in red winning their first game in Murrayfield for, well, quite some time.
The only thing I&#8217;ll say about the England/Italy game is this: uncontested scrums in an international? You what?
So it&#8217;s all down to next weekend. I am very, very excited. Unless Ireland win by 25 points, the lads from the Principality have the championship in the bag. With their current form and the advantage of playing at home, I feel it&#8217;s unlikely Ireland will win by that much. However, the far more tantalising dream is of Wales beating Ireland and getting their first Grand Slam since 1978. Considering that, since the 5 nations became 6, Wales have never finished in the top 3, this year has seen quite a turn around in their fortunes and one I have been predicting since their performance in the World Cup 18 months ago.
The mighty Welsh dragon has at last got his voice back and his roar will be heard across the nations.

Where are they now?
March 14th, 2005               
There was an interview with Ron Silver in this morning&#8217;s Metro which surprised me because I thought he was dead.

Don&#8217;t Panic
March 11th, 2005               
Pete is right, the trailer for the imminent Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy movie is very good.
And remember this; Sam Rockwell (Zaphod Beeblebrox) and Alan Rickman (the voice of Marvin, the Paranoid Android) have appeared in a sci-fi comedy before, namely &#8220;Galaxy Quest&#8221;. And that was very, very funny. And it had Galaxy in the the title too. (Yes I know it has absolutely no bearing as to whether H2G2 is going to be any good but so what?)
The trailer.

Show me the Monet
March 11th, 2005               
Have you heard the one about the Englishman, American and Frenchman in an art gallery? As mentioned before, I went to the Tate Britain last night for a corporate function at the Turner, Whistler and Monet exhibition and got a free tour around the gallery too. I was surprised at how interesting it was, not only in seeing the pictures which generally shared a theme of being paintings of London during the 19th century, but also how the style of painting changed in the course of the 1800s, at about the same time as the invention of the camera. 
However, the one thing that really stunned me was when the gallery staff brought round canapes which consisted of tiny, one inch diameter cheeseburgers. I felt like Gulliver at a Lilliputian McDonalds.

Facts of life #1
March 11th, 2005               
Introducing a new series of little observations about the modern world which shall henceforth be known as &#8220;The Facts of Life&#8221;
While it is true that egg mayonnaise and sausages go well together as a sandwich filling and that sausages and mustard are also an acceptable combination to put between two slices of bread, egg mayonnaise, sausages and mustard does not work. Fact.

The Stalker Manifesto
March 11th, 2005               
There are times when life really gets you down. I mean really gets you down. The latter half of 2004 did that for me. Well, it&#8217;s a new year and this new year brings with it a new site, new blog and new danger.
Simon Pegg&#8217;s Stalker is about the things that provide distraction from the tedium and crapness of the world. It&#8217;s not about me1, your charming, witty and verbose host, although it will contain many of my opinions (which I&#8217;m sure you may not agree with but that, in time, you will come to acknowledge as being right) . It&#8217;s just about stuff. Trivial stuff. Mundane, inane stuff. Distracting stuff. 
And that&#8217;s it. No politics, no introspection, no campaigns to free the righteous four, none of that crap. That&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t do any of that - I&#8217;m just not going to be doing it here. 
There will be a lot about films because, well, I like films. Films are good. Films are fun. And I like talking about films. I also like music. And games and books and taking photographs, and diving and drinking (but not at the same time unless I lose my regulator) and the list goes on. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not going to be an entirely cheery and upbeat &#8220;Isn&#8217;t life great&#8221; site because there are some truly awful films out there that I want to complain about. 
And that&#8217;s the Stalker Manifesto. If you want politics, go to a political blog. If you want observations about the tube, go to Annie Mole&#8217;s site, if you want general swearage then D4D is for you. 
So if you&#8217;re looking for naval gazing, introspective philosophising and rants against the current political regime and the war on terriers then you won&#8217;t find it here. (But buy me a few drinks and you&#8217;ll have as much of it as you want - don&#8217;t say we don&#8217;t believe in the personal touch!)
But if you want to get away from all that, then get your cup of coffee, pull up a chair, sit down, make yourself comfortable, remember you forgot your glasses, get up, go back to the kitchen, pour a few drops of that cheap whiskey your brother brought you back from Hanover into your coffee, get frustrated that you still can&#8217;t find your glasses and give up looking for them, come back, sit down, relax and enjoy.
Here endeth the &#8220;About this site&#8221; spiel. I promise it should get better from here on in.
1Except for the bits where I tell you about my sporting achievements, my recent injuries, my weight loss and other stuff that&#8217;s just trivial crap really.

At last we shall have revenge
March 11th, 2005               
Almost six years ago I was in New York and happened to conveniently stumble into a film called &#8220;The Phantom Menace&#8221; which was a prequel to a series of films that were quite popular in the late seventies and early eighties. 
Three years ago there was a sequel to the prequel that was called &#8220;Attack of the Clones&#8221;. The title was very B-Movie and the film was, in parts, blockbuster genius but mostly was C-Movie shlock.
Apparently, in what might turn out to be a vain attempt at redemption for past sins (namely the above two films) a further sequel is to be released this year. This time it has the pant-wettingly promising title of &#8220;Revenge of the Sith&#8221; and the new trailer is already doing the rounds on the internet. 
I&#8217;ve reserved a table for one in a restaurant called Judgement for May 18th this year.

Rebirth
March 10th, 2005               
Yes, I&#8217;m back blogging again and you can thank the lovely people at Wordpress for that. They recently released version 1.5 of their freeware CMS which has a far better default interface than the previous versions. And seeing as I meant to start blogging again in January but hadn&#8217;t finished my new design (that will be finished when it&#8217;s finished!), it&#8217;ll do for now. I also love the new &#8220;themes&#8221; manager they&#8217;ve added so there may be a whole variety of themes coming your way (but as I&#8217;m far too lazy for any of that, it&#8217;s unlikely).
I have a more defined purpose behind blogging now and will be publishing the Stalker Manifesto soon. (No, really, I promise). The content will be familiar to former readers of headCleaner() but I&#8217;m taking an entirely different approach this time around. 
Let&#8217;s put it this way, if the phrase &#8220;pop culture&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean anything to you or leaves you cold or makes you want to vomit then you&#8217;re probably not going to like it.
In the meantime, I can&#8217;t decide whether or not I should be proud and impressed that it&#8217;s taken me a mere 9 hours to get my first bit of comment spam since I re-published the database. Suggestions on the best WP plugins to install to reduce (or negate entirely) further spam will be gratefully received. 
Right, I&#8217;m off out to be cultured at the Tate Britain. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be able to tell you all about Turner, Whistler and Monet unless I am seduced by Messrs Moet and Chandon instead.
