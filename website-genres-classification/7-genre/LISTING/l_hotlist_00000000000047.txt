Introduction
You COULD look for books or magazines to find out about Comets, but why not use the power of the Internet instead? The links below will get you started. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Internet Resources
* Bang and Splat - This site shows simulated pictures of a comet hitting earth. The animations are great! We hope you will like the audio on this exciting web page. 
* Appendix C - The Probability of collisions with Earth - This site tells you about the solar system and bodies with no atmosphere like Mercury or the Moon. The craters on the moon were caused by impacts of comets and asteroids. It is really fun to read, you will learn alot. 
* The Comet Primer - This is a very interesting site. It describes the make-up of Comets! One thing it talks about is the Oorit cloud, it is millions of comets in one formation. Another thing it talks about is a comet that was 40-50 kil. in diameter. It also said that a comet's tail was 30-40 mill. kil.in length. We hope you will find this site useful. 
* Comets - If you like comets this is the site for you! It has 13 pages of jam packed interesting information. One site says that in the year 1066 when Halles Comet appeared that people in Europe blamed the comet for their kings death. Another page talks about a giant comet hitting Earth. It says that thats what killed the dinosours. This is one of our favorite web sites and we hope you like it too. 
* Comet Busters - This is another interesting site it talkes about different possibilities of destroying Comets,Astroids or whatever is on a crash couse with earth. The guy that invented the H-Bome says that 'he can get the job done' He wants to send up as much fire power as he can, into space and disinigrate whats going to hit earth. It also says that if a Comet hit we could have an eternall winter. Scientists say that if they had the funds they could create the teachnalogy to know in advance if a short-term comet is going to hit earth. Like we said This is another exciting and interesting Web site, We hope you have fun!!!, Bye
