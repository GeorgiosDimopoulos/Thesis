AbiWord Downloads

This page list the lastest supported AbiWord downloads. AbiWord plugins are available here as well. Plugins expand AbiWord's functionality, and users are thus advised to download these additional packages as well.

Note that other downloads might exist, but are not listed here, such as dependencies and source packages for various operating systems. These packages can be found at our general SourceForce download area.

If you don't need stability, and just want the latest cutting edge development version of AbiWord, then head over to our AbiWord Development Downloads.
