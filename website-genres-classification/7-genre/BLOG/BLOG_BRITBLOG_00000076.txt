 9th March 2005  
Good news: I&#8217;m currently featuring in a two-page Nike ACG ad that&#8217;s running in a number of magazines (Men&#8217;s Health, FHM, Men&#8217;s Fitness, etc, etc).
Bad news: I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint, but it&#8217;s not actually Nike gear that I&#8217;m wearing in the photo. In fact, I&#8217;m not wearing anything at all. I&#8217;m really sorry, mum!

The Abyss
 8th March 2005  
I was on the verge of writing a post on how busy/stressed/tired/ill I am when I remembered John Ridgway&#8217;s wise words about the dangers of &#8216;gazing into the abyss of self-pity&#8216;. 
So, instead, here&#8217;s a funny picture. I&#8217;ll write something sensible tomorrow.

Whitepod, James Bond and Paninis
 4th March 2005  
The good news: I spoke at an event for the Discovery Channel last night, but it was about as far removed from the usual hotel conference centre as you can get - the venue was the breathtaking Whitepod &#8216;eco camp&#8217; in the Swiss Alps (see wobbly cameraphone shot). It was a very intimate event, with a fantastic mix of (mostly Scandinavian) guests and by the time I did my bit in the evening, it felt like I was addressing a bunch of friends. I was booked on an early flight from Geneva back home this morning and I was treated to a high-speed dawn skidoo ride to meet a waiting taxi further down the valley. (Cue James Bond fantasies of ducking bullets, skydiving off cliffs and yanking open Union Jack parachutes&#8230;)
The bad news: I didn&#8217;t actually get to sleep in one of the Whitepods - they were all full and I crashed out on some sofa cushions, on the floor of the chalet next door. I have a stinking cold, I&#8217;ve nearly lost my voice, the flight home was delayed for ages and when we did get airborne, it was full of screaming kids and the soggy bacon and egg &#8216;panini&#8217; we were served gave me flashbacks from our journey through Siberia last spring. The Bond fantasy didn&#8217;t last long.

Notes from California
 2nd March 2005  
I&#8217;ve just got back from speaking at TED in Monterey, California, and what an event it was. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever met such an incredible community of people under the same roof, and I can&#8217;t imagine that there&#8217;s anything quite the same anywhere else on the planet. The awesome Pop!Tech came close, but the two are very different; Pop!Tech had a cosy, welcoming, laid-back atmosphere whereas at TED I felt a little intimidated by the whole affair when I first turned up.
The sheer level of intellect, achievement and, well, money that was hovering around was almost overwhelming. The founders of Google, eBay and Amazon.com were there. The co-discoverer of DNA was there. The head of General Motors was there. The creator of The Simpsons was there. U2&#8217;s Bono spoke to the audience (via a very snazzy near-holographic satellite link) for nearly an hour. David Blaine was playing card tricks on guests. And I had to get up and speak to all 1,000 &#8216;TEDsters&#8217; on Thursday afternoon.
After my 20-minute talk, however, everything changed - like the survivor of a rite of passage, I was sucked right into the heart of TED. My mind is still spinning, but I&#8217;m going to try and pick out a few of the highlights for me over the next few days.
The first has to be the contrast between the stunning (and often shocking) photography of Ed Burtynsky and the phenomenal vision, optimism and energy of the designer Ross Lovegrove and the architect William McDonough. Sustainability is a bit of a buzzword right now, but the work these visionaries are doing utterly reaffirmed my faith in the human race. Moving stuff indeed, and I now have a few exciting ideas to do with this year&#8217;s expedition bubbling away. I&#8217;ll write more soon.
Elsewhere, I&#8217;ve just noticed that those fine fellows over at StyleGala.com have included my site in their &#8216;worth a visit&#8217; section - wahey!
Last but not least, there are some TED2005 photos on Flickr. There&#8217;s one of me in there somewhere&#8230;

TED
 24th February 2005  
Oooh mumma. TED kicked off at 2pm today - the first speaker was Nobel Laureate and cracker of the DNA code, James Watson and from then until 6:30 the speakers, stories, ideas, concepts and questions came thick and fast - speakers have just 18 minutes each on stage (there are 50 speakers in four days) and there&#8217;s no time for q&a. There are some incredible people here, and the whole event has been slightly surreal so far - I&#8217;ve just got back from a cocktail party at Monterey&#8217;s fabulous aquarium - I was completely zonked with jetlag and hung out with my friend Alex Steffen from WorldChanging.org.
I&#8217;m a bit miffed that I&#8217;m not feeling on top form. I still have toothache (and an accompanying hamster cheek) and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll clear up before tomorrow - I&#8217;m on stage at three-ish, in the unenviable slot between the hilarious Ze Frank and, er, Bono. I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes and I&#8217;ll endeavour to write a little more about this exceptional event before too long&#8230;

* The PoleTrack team (soon setting out to ski from Russia to the North Pole via the same route as my solo expedition last spring) are reporting temperatures of &#8216;minus eight and minus nine&#8217; and thin ice/open water all the way up to 83 degrees. Jeepers. 
* Unmanned British research submarine goes missing in Antarctica. 
PrÃ©cis
 21st February 2005  
Busy busy busy. Last week: a trip to Cornwall (v. exciting meeting about involving as many schools as possible with the next expedition, followed by a calf-burning, lung-bursting training ride from Newquay to Padstow and back (hi Rhys!)), a speech to IBM, 17 hours of training, a rather exciting operation involving a Russian icebreaker and a helicopter (all will be revealed soon) and a semi-naked photo shoot for Nike ACG (nearly all will be revealed soon).
This week: emergency dental treatment for a gum abscess (ouch), a trip to Monterey, California where I&#8217;m speaking at TED, a party hosted by the founders of Google on Tuesday night, a flight back to London on Saturday, a flight to Oslo on Sunday and ten hours of training to fit in (it&#8217;s a &#8216;recovery&#8217; week).
Next week: A flight to Spitsbergen on Monday, three days&#8217; dogsledding and skidooing with a handful of Serco employees in Svalbard, a flight back to Oslo (then London) on Wednesday, a flight out to Geneva to give a talk for the Discovery Channel at the awesome looking Whitepod in the Swiss Alps on Thursday, a flight back to London on Friday, a talk at the Destinations Travel Show in Birmingham on Sunday and 16 hours of training.
Meanwhile, scientists have discovered sea ice on Mars. 
&#8220;This mission has changed many of my long-held opinions about Mars - we now have to go there and check it out.&#8221;

* &#8220;We have observed an object only 20km across, on the other side of our galaxy, releasing more energy in a 10th of a second than the Sun emits in 100,000 years.&#8221; 
* This just made my day - the gorgeous Nina Gordon singing NWA&#8217;s Straight Outta Compton. (Link via Ben Hammersley. In case you&#8217;ve never heard of NWA, be warned, there&#8217;s a wee bit of swearing&#8230;) 
* I caught up with Jason Kottke when he was in London recently - at one point, he pulled a tatty piece of paper out of his pocket to check a phone number. &#8216;Yep&#8216;, he laughed, &#8216;it&#8217;s my analogue Palm Pilot. 
Telltale signs you&#8217;re getting old&#8230;
 14th February 2005  
I&#8217;m in a grump because a local pirate radio station has completely wiped out my Radio 4 reception. (When I first moved to London, nearly four years ago, I was over the moon at how many pirate stations were on the air. Mind you, back then they played more jungle and less garage.)
