training for the half marathon  
right then here we go!!!!and we're off i have chosen to participate in the bristol half marathon, its ludacris i tell you i find it hard walking up the stairs let alone run 13 odd miles! its about 2 mile run from my home to park street, i have not ran long distance in over 5 years! so its going to be very hard. i just started my training two weeks ago, the first run took me almost half hour by which point i was almost pronounced dead! my intention was to run back yeah right as if so i caught the bus. the next day my whole body was killing me, seating, standing, walking they all hurt. im so unfit, and not to say the least that my diet is atrocious. i think i need to do some research into how im going to be able to do this. stuff like training schedules from other sources and actually eat healthy foos rather than chips and pizza.for almost a week my body is still suffering with pain arg! yeah call that pain?!?!? well just remember that im not really used to any activity as extreme as long distance running. ok i do however do aggreissive inline rollerblading buts that nothing compared running really. i have a history of sport non the less, i used to play and coach tennis for several years. i did do long distance running at school and played a lot of football. 5 years later however i walk everywhere but only because i can't afford to catch the bus. if i could i would catch the bus. ill get straight to the point my mum says it, my ex says it and so does everyone i have ever met. "diego you're too lazy"!!!!!!! i guess by commiting to this goal of completing the half marathon i would not only proof them all wrong but you could say that then i have a valid excuse! well not really...... im still recovering from a burst stomach ulcher which occured last september, on the day i left hospital the half marathon was on and thats how i found out about it. that day all i wanted to do was to go home, watching crowds of peole living theirs lives made me not mad nor depressed but anxious and short tempered. i was happy to see people together but all i wanted was to go home. well anyway i think it would be a great achivement if i was to try and complete the half marathon a year after leaving hospital. the fact that i was close to death has given me a taste of live i want to help people i will raising money for bernados childrens charity during the race(mission). during my second training session it was not as bad the pain was not that hardfelt and the time was reduced and as for the morning after i felt alright. i have however still not improved my dieting and im in need for some serious motivation as the temptation to run tomorrow instead of today is infact very tempting!arg! posted by diego at 8:06 AM 0 comments
