Welcome to New Zealand - Aotearoa.
 Come on a journey with me as I show you around a little touch of paradise that I proudly call home - New Zealand.
 
If you are looking to spend your hard earned tourist dollar, New Zealand is the place to do it. If you looking to get away from it all - to relax and unwind, or are you the adventurous type who likes extreme sports which get's the andrenalin flowing? Don't worry, New Zeland has it all!
 
Experience the culture and friendly hospitality of the New Zealand people. Relax and unwind with your choice of secluded beaches, zoos, parks and gardens. Enjoy and marvel at the undisturbed nature and wildlife of this diverse country. 
Get the heart pumping with adventure & extreme sports like white water kyaking, bungee jumping, skiing, surfing and mountain biking (to name just a few).
 
But don't take my word for it. While Tom Cruise was in New Zealand filming the movie The Last Samurai, he said in an interview - " There were so many great things to do in New Zealand. I tried a little surfing, we went caving and sea kayaking...It's such a beautiful place. "
 
Unlike other tourism related web sites, this site is a non-commercial, unbiased and personal view of New Zealand. I will guide you to web sites which relate to many areas of interest around this beautiful country, without the added pressures of a commercially-slanted outlook.
 
So sit back and take some time to look around this wonderful country. Please feel free to comment on this site. I am always looking for new and exciting sites to add.
