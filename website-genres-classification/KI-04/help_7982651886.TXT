Dear amanda

My girlfriend and I practice safe sex i.e. she is on the pill and I wear a condom but we would like
to know when the best time is to have intercourse without the condom and me not pulling out of
her before I ejaculate?

Dear overkill,

Wow! You don't get any safer than that without living in different states. It
sounds like what you're asking is 'when is a womens infertile phase?' If she is on the pill and
taking it properly she is never fertile. The 1% failure rate of The Pill is due to human error,
either forgetting to take it or using some antibiotics and other medications nullify the pill's
effectiveness. Here is a link to a Natural Birth Control Method page but as this information is
religiously based we disavow the accuracy of it's info.

My boyfriend (of 6 months) asked me if I wanted to see other people. He said that he thought that I needed some time away. Do you think he really just wants to be away from me and cant tell me or is it something else???

Dear Lost:

It seems from what you say that he is looking for room to run. Maybe he is trying to see someone else but, you have to live also. Don't let him stop you. Move on if he is serious.

You deserve better.

I was looking through web pages and found yours. I really like it and had a small question. My mom and dad don't understand me. They never let me stay out at night and when my friends want to go out to a party they don't want me to go and I miss out on everything. All I want to do is fit in and they say I cant. I was thinking about running away to my friends house in another state, then I would be able to do whatever, whenever I wanted.

Dear No Fair:

Well I know it is tough at this stage in life(I'm guessing your in your teens), but your parents want you to be safe and happy and they are trying to do their best. Give them a chance and try talking to one of them one on one. If you explain to them how you feel they might lighten up some. It wont hurt to try.

Love Amanda
