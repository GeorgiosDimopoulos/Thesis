Wellcome to Fandrup's homepage!	 	
Hi!
My name is Line and I'm a 19 years old girl from Denmark where I live in a town named Hedehusene, here I live with my family.
In everyday life I'm always a bit stressed because I go to school, work, ride, make homework, sleeps, eates......and sometimes, every second week I also like to see my friends.....yeah I actually have some......:-)
While I remember it, greetings to Rasmus Cederholm from Denmark, who I think will enjoy my new homepage, at least more than my old one.......(Ja, denne er ikke helt gennemført i Barbie-stilen).
Rasmus is my classmate at Copenhagen business school, where we study economy and math. We've just started this summer, so it's still very new, but untill now I really like it and I have got to known many nice people. You can mail me there at lifa98ab@student.econ.cbs.dk	 	
This is mostly danish webpages that I use often, but you'll might find some english in between.	 
909-The place to find telephonenumber and adresses for friends, family or others (only Denmark)
Hesteinfo-A danish place where you can find all you need to know about horses.
Krak- If you need to get anywhere in Denmark but don't know which way to go/drive use this page and just type in the adress and you'll get instructions how to get there.
HT-If you go by bus in Copenhagen or the surburbs use this page to get to know which bus to take.
Morten opskriftsamling - If you like to cook but can't find the recipes try this danish site.
Carstens homepage - also visit my cousin Carstens homepage, which is quite nice.
In my sparetime I like to ride, I have a horse named Lukas.
With him a go to a lot of meeting where we compete against other horses and riders, both in show-jumping and dressage, we are actually getting quite good! :-)	 	
I also have a cat her name is Bianca, she is 2½ years old, and pretty cute. 
A little bit fat though, but she is also very spoiled.....what can you do.....	 	
Did you enjoy your time here?
You did!!
Then mail me at LineAF@consiva.dk
