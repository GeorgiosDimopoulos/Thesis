I'm trying to adapt to Safari, but like IE better, normally. I haven't really found Safari to be faster in general, but it does seem pretty stable. However, I like being able to send a link from IE, where I just hold down on Mail and the option to send link pops up. Haven;t been able tofind anything like that in Safari, having to copy and paste is OLD news. Also, what about the ability to determine differemt destination folders for downloading from Safari? IE does it each time you tell it to download to disk, but Safari only has one preference and no options on the fly.
