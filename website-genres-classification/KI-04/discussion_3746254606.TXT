It is very important to follow the Code of Ethics as Social Workers. But when is it okay to draw the line? J.

In practice, there can be many grey areas when it comes to confidentiality, even though on paper, the guidelines seem pretty clear. 

I work in a hospital setting, in out-patient psychiatry and mental health. We often get referrals from medical doctors who do not first obtain written consent from their patients to reveal the personal information. This is routine for them, and may in fact be allowable by their College of Physicians and Surgeons. 

I am wondering what my colleagues reading this would do in the following case: 
A physician who referred a client to our clinical team later called the intake number after a few weeks to find out if that patient had been assigned yet and if so, which clinician she was seeing. There was no release signed for us to disclose to this doctor or vice-versa. 

Now, I could have just been helpful and told her what she wanted to know. Instead, I thought of the code of ethics of my College and my own principals. In a respectful way, I confirmed that the referral had been logged, but I would not confirm (or disconfirm)that the referred adolescent was a client. I respectfully requested that she get her patient to sign a consent for disclosure, then I would be more than happy to answer her questions. 

Needless to say, the doctor was a little miffed with me, but did follow through with obtaining a proper consent. A couple of my co-workers (also SWrs) thought I was a bit rigid and said that they would have answered her questions. 

What would you have done? Does anyone have other examples from the field where the issue of confidentiality was in a grey area?

Tom, 
I am still a grad student, and have faced similiar situations as you described. It seems to be a tough call. One one hand there is the code of ethics, and on the other hand there is the reality of expediency and not wanting to be viewed as too "rigid". I am learning that there is no easy answers.
