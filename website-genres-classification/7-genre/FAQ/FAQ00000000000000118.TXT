2.2 Filing Requirements/Status/Dependents/Exemptions: Filing Status
I'm single, live alone, and have no dependents. Can I file as head of household?
No. To use this filing status, you must have paid over half the cost of keeping up a home for you and a qualifying child or other qualifying person for over half the year. For detailed information, refer to Tax Topic 353, What is Your Filing Status, or Publication 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.

My wife and I have been separated since May. She has one child (grandchild) living with her. Can we both file as single? 
You and your wife may file either a joint return or separate returns. If you and your wife file separate returns, your filing status would be married filing separately. Your wife may qualify for head of household status. Refer to Publication 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information, for more information.

If I moved out of my house on July 1, but was not divorced at the end of the year, can I file as head of household and take the earned income credit if I have a minor child? Can I also claim child care expenses?
You do not qualify for the head of household filing status because you and your spouse have not lived apart for the last 6 months of the taxable year and are not considered unmarried. Your filing status for the year will either be married filing separately, or married filing jointly. If it is married filing separately, you will not qualify for the Earned Income Credit and cannot claim a credit based on child care expenses. If you file a joint return with your spouse, you may be eligible to claim these credits. See Publication 503, Child and Dependent Care Expenses and Publication 596, Earned Income Credit.

If two single people (never married) have a child and have always lived together providing equal support for that child, can they both claim head of household status?
Only the person who paid more that half the cost of keeping up a home for the year would qualify for the head of household filing status. If both people paid exactly the same amount, neither would qualify for the head of household filing status. Please refer to Publication 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information, for more information.

As a single parent, can I claim head of household filing status as long as I have a child living with me (no matter what the age of the child) and paid for over half the cost of keeping up a home?
