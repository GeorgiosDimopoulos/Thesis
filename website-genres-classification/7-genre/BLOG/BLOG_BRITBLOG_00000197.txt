Jordan, again  
Well, after all the tales about that brothel in nearby Maresfield and the model called Jordan moving in, it would appear that the village really has gone to the dogs.I now hear that that model has planted a big six-foot fence all round her property. I shall be travelling down there soon to investigate. posted by Howard Thompson at Tuesday, March 15, 2005 0 comments

The Eurovision Song Compost and Natasha Kaplinsky  
Did anyone happen to stumble across the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night, or as I like to call it, the Eurovision Song Compost? I see that yet another singer had what we now call a "wardrobe malfunction", and managed to expose the bosom, like that LaToya Jackson did at that damn Yankee ball game, last year.I don't know why Mr Terry Wogan continues to associate his name with this terrible programme. However, I was not all surprised to see Natasha Kaplinsky on the blooming telly again, or as Mrs Thompson likes to call her, Natasha Slapinsky. posted by Howard Thompson at Monday, March 07, 2005 0 comments

Inclement weather  
This cold snap only serves to show up the inadequacies of both our weather forecasters and local councils.Firstly, one can get a clearer picture of the upcoming weather by simply nailing a piece of seaweed to one's property. Countless times the weathermen and weathergirls said the snow was going to get worse in the south east, but did it? Did it heck. We did get a heavy sprinkling of the white stuff but it was hardly Arctic conditions.Having said that, the local council really does need to start salting the pavements of our towns and villages. Some of them were quite treacherous. Of course, I feel extremely safe when I'm pootling around in my trusty Volvo, but put me on the icy boardwalk and I fear I may fall and break my sternum. posted by Howard Thompson at Saturday, February 26, 2005 0 comments

The hypocracy of football on BBC  
I settled down today after an early Sunday lunch (cooked by the obliging Mrs Thompson), to watch Burnley FC versus Blackburn Rovers on the television. Midway through the second half of an absorbing local derby, a streaker ran onto the pitch. However, for all their wisdom, the BBC choose not to show these naked people on our TVs. I just cannot understand it. They showed a coin and a mobile phone hitting Manchester United's goalkeeper in the televised game on Saturday night. They even showed people being blown up in the Second Iraq War. But, they draw the line at streakers. Come on the BBC, I pay my TV licence to watch things like this. posted by Howard Thompson at Sunday, February 20, 2005 0 comments

What is this all about?  
Could someone please tell me who this "Pete Doherty" is and why all the newspapers and television broadcasts keep showing his face? From what I can deduce, he is in a band called Libery X and is a drug addict. So why is my paper, The Times, indulging in him? Needless to say, I have written to the editor in a bid to seek out the facts. posted by Howard Thompson at Wednesday, February 09, 2005 0 comments
