14.5 Electronic Filing (e-file) and TeleFile: TeleFile
What is TeleFile?
TeleFile is an interactive computer program that calculates your taxes and begins the electronic filing process over the phone. IRS automatically sends a special TeleFile package to those who may be eligible to use it. Only those receiving the package can use TeleFile. This year, many taxpayers who filed Form 1040EZ (PDF), Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers With No Dependents, or by TeleFile last year will receive a special TeleFile tax package that allows them to file their taxes electronically by phone. TeleFile is easy, fast, and free. It's available 24 hours a day, with nothing to mail in. TeleFile is a great way for students to file their tax returns. Refer to Tax Topic 255, TeleFile, for more information.

Where can I get a TeleFile form?
If you file a paper tax return for the current year and qualify to TeleFile, the IRS should send you a TeleFile package in the mail by January 20th of the following year, which will include your PIN number. If you qualify and do not receive the package, call (800) 829-1040 and request one. If you do not qualify, you can still receive all of the benefits that IRS e-file has to offer by using a personal computer or filing through an Authorized IRS e-file Provider.

I don't owe taxes. Can I file using TeleFile after April 15th?
Yes, you can TeleFile until August 15th. If August 15th falls on a weekend or federal holiday, you have until midnight of the following business day to submit your return. That being said, to file after April 15th, you need to apply for an extension of time to file your return prior to April 15th. For information about applying for an extension, see Form 4868 (PDF), Application for Automatic of Time to File US Individual Income Tax Return.

What is a 1040PC tax return?
The 1040PC was an alternative to filing a conventional paper tax return. It was a computer generated tax return that prints out only the lines on which you made an entry. The IRS no longer accepts paper returns in the 1040PC format.
