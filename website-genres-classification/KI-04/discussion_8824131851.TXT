  Chevy Roof Vibrates

Author: James     Posted: Wed - 10-01-2003 at 7:57 pm	      	 

I own an 03 2500HD extended cab Chevy. This has been a great truck except when I put my 8' SunLite canper on it. With the camper on, the roof on the truck vibrates so much at 65 mph that it becomes intolerable. Has anyone else experience this problem? Solutions? The dealer hasn't been any help.

 	 		I have not heard about this problem. I believe the easy fix is to get one of the air stabilizer boots that fit between the cab and camper. They are like a rectangular inner tube that you blow up by mouth. This will stop the air from getting between the camper and cab that causes the condition you describe. It is also great for stopping the bugs splattering on the under side of the camper where it is hard to clean. This should actually make the camper go down the road smoother because you are not trapping the air in there any longer. Ismo............

 	 		Thanks for the suggestion. Since the first post I went to another dealer. They took it for a test ride and then immediately called GM. GM said this has been an issue and the truck is going into the body shop Weds. I am not sure what they plan to do but if they don't fix the problem I will look into your suggestion.

 	 		The dealer added 5 ribs to the roof (at no cost) which stopped the vibration.
