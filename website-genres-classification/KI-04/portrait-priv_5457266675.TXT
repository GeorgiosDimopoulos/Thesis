Private Homepage of Michel Py

If you want to know more about me, go directly to my new Private Homepage 

I recently developped a Truck Theory Learning Software (for switzerland only) ! 
The Firm where I work developped a very useful Crystal Reports Font Check tool ! 
Or are you searching for my good old free DOS PC Tools with source code ? 

Did you know that I played Saxophone in a Big-Band ? 
Take a look at the UIB Jazz Orchestra Homepage !
