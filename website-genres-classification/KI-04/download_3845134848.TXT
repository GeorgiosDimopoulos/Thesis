Installation instructions

To install Blender, download the appropriate package for your platform to your computer. The Windows version comes with a self-extracting installer, for other operating systems you can unpack the compressed file to the location of your choice. There is a more detailed installation guide chapter in the Blender Documentation Project, to guide you through installing and starting Blender on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

To unlock additional 'Publisher' features of Blender 2.25, you will need to install the key file. Previously, the key file was only available as a commercial product, however you can now download a key file free of charge.

To install the key, start up Blender. In the File menu (top bar, left), select 'Install Key' . Use the Blender file selection window to browse to the location where you saved the key, select the key file with the left mouse button, and press the "LOAD" button.

If the install was successful, a new splash screen will appear, a new P icon in the top header will be visible, and extra 'Publisher' functionality will be unlocked.
