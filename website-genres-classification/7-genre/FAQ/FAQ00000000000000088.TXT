1.3 IRS Procedures: Amended Returns & Form 1040X
What should I do if I made a mistake on my federal return that I have already filed?
It depends on the type of mistake that was made. Many mathematical errors are caught in the processing of the tax return itself. If you did not attach a required schedule the service will contact you and ask for the missing information. 
If you did not report all your income or did not claim a credit you are entitled to file an amended or corrected return using Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Include copies of any schedules that have been changed or any Forms W-2 you did not include. The Form 1040X should be submitted after you receive your refund or by the due date of the return, whichever, is earlier. Generally, to claim a refund, the Form 1040X must be received within three years after the date you filed your original return or within two years after the date you paid the tax, whichever is later.

For what reasons would I need to file an amended return?
If the errors are in the arithmetic, the service center will usually correct them. If forms or schedules were left out, the service center will request additional information from you and you do not need to file an amended return. 
But if you find that you did not report some income, you claimed deductions or credits you should not have claimed you failed to claim some deductions or credits to which you are entitled, or you should have used a different filing status, you should file an amended return.

I made a mistake and sent in too much money. How do I fix this?
You should not have to do anything. The IRS service center should make the correction for you. You will receive a refund of the difference between what you owe and what you sent in.

I still haven't received my refund, but it is bigger than it should be because I've discovered I made a mistake on my return. What should I do?
It depends on the type of mistake that was made on the return. Mathematical errors are often corrected in the initial processing of the return itself. Allow the service to process the return, and if necessary make changes using Form 1040X (PDF), Amended U.S. Individual Tax Return. Include copies of any schedules that have been changed or any Form W-2 you did not include. 
To avoid owing interest on any amounts you owe you must file the Form 1040X and pay the balance owed before the due date of the return. Wait until you get the original refund check, or until the due date of the return, whichever is earlier, to file the Form 1040X and pay the additional tax. Send a check or money order for the full amount payable to the United States Treasury. On your payment include your name, address, daytime phone number, social security number, the tax year, and type of return.

I received a refund that is more than I should have received because I've discovered I made a mistake on my return. I have not yet cashed this check. What should I do now?
Many mistakes are corrected in processing and a letter of explanation is mailed at the time the refund is issued. If the mistake was not corrected in processing, you need to file an amended or corrected return using Form 1040X (PDF) , Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, as soon as possible. Include copies of any schedules that have been changed or any Forms W-2 you did not include. If you return the refund check with a letter of explanation, a refund in the correct amount will be issued when the amended return processes.

My wife and I filed jointly. Now I discovered that if we filed married filing separately we would have received a larger refund. How do I file amended returns to go from a joint return to married filing separate returns?
You can only make the change from filing joint to filing separately if you file the corrected returns before the original due date of the tax return. Request for this type of change will be disallowed if filed after the due date of the original return.

My husband and I filed jointly, but now we want to file married filing separately. What do we do?
These are the procedures to follow if you are making the change before the due date of the return. The person with the primary social security number (the first number listed on the return) will need to file Form 1040X (PDF), Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Make sure you show the original filing status as married filing jointly and the new filing status as married filing separately. Start with the numbers on the joint return in Column A and show the adjustments in Column B to remove your spouse's income and deductions. 
The person with the secondary social security number (the second number listed on the return) will need to file a new return with a filing status of married filing separately and show his or her own income and deductions.
