January 14, 2003 - 
Yes it is indeed that time of year again - We are just getting back from the 2003 Consumer Electronics show. We were there for 5 days, including press day, so that we could keep ourselves and you up-to-date on all the latest and greatest gadgets. 
This year's show topped all others in attendance figures, with over 116,000 people walking (and walking, and walking) more then a million feet of exhibit space. What was the buzz? What is hot? What is fading?
Stay tuned ...we're typing just as fast as we can!

September 11, 2002  
A moment of silence ...
A year ago today we paused, and asked all of our readers to join us in a moment of silence, as the world stopped and gasped to catch its breath after a day of unbelievable atrocities.
Today, on this site, mostly dedicated to the fantasy of movies and the faithfully reproduction of them at home, we choose to focus not on whimsy  but on the real world, America, and the victims and heroes that  have given their lives to keep this country and the world free.
United We Stand ... 
Sincerely,
Managing Editor
