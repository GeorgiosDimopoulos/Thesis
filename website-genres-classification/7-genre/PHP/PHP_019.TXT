What I do
I work within the world of business application software, you know, the stuff that makes people's jobs easier. I work on my farm for pleasure (doesn't everybody?)because there are countless opportunities to be creative and innovative -- and all on a budget! 
Farming is the only business in the world where you buy retail and sell wholesale.
