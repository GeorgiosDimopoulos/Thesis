Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics 
The Sixth Annual Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics will be held at UNL February 6-8, 2004. See our website for more information. If you have questions, send email to ncuwm@math.unl.edu. 
By the way, this conference was started in celebration of the UNL Department of Mathematics and Statistics receipt of the 1998 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring.(Follow that link for information on the award, and to see a cool picture of me with President Clinton!)

Teaching Interests
All Girls/All Math 
All Girls/All Math is the name we've given to some outreach programs for High School Girls. One such program is a week-long Summer Camp. The first camp was held at UNL July 20-26, 1997. The 2002 Camps will be held July 7-12 and July 21-26, 2002. For more information please contact Tamie Robotham at agam@math.unl.edu. 
Project NExT 
Project NExT is an MAA program, funded with a grant from the Exxon Educational Foundation, for new and recent Ph.D.'s in their first few years of a teaching position. I am a 1996-7 Project NExT Fellow (a "Blue Dot"). Top of Page

Cool Links
Someday, they'll even be ORGANIZED cool links! 
My daughter, Madeline Rose Walker, was born July 8, 2002. 
I got my PhD at the University of Illinois. My advisor was Nigel Boston. 
UIUC has the MAGMA handbook online. You can go straight to the index if you want. 
Another tool for group theory is GAP. It's free but not as powerful as MAGMA. 
If you're more interested in commutative algebra or algebraic geometry, Macaulay 2 is very useful. 
The American Mathematical Society page has lots of useful information for mathematicians, including the Combined Membership List, a list of AMS Meetings and Conferences, and MathSciNet. 
The National Security Agency offers grants to people working in certain types of mathematics. 
The Penn State Math Department maintains a list of Mathematics Information Servers. You can jump directly to the USA list if you want. 
The IEEE is a professional society for electrical engineers. The IEEE Transactions on Information Theory is a journal which publishes lots of great articles on coding theory. 
The National Science Foundation also funds all sorts of mathematics- (and science-) related activities. The Division of Mathematical Sciences is the main place to go for grants in mathematics. To apply for a grant, you need the Forms and the Grant Proposal Guide. You also need to know about Fastlane. 
You can find an address or phone number for just about anything at BigBook, or you might want to try AnyWho. 
If you need to know currency exchange rates, there's a great site at Yahoo. 
The University of Georgia maintains a great site of Things of Interest to Number Theorists. 
Flifo provides a good search engine for plane tickets and rental cars. You can also Check Flight Status on Flifo. 
Midwest Express offers nonstop flights from Omaha to many places with "first class" service. There's also a page to check on flight status. 
If you want general quotations, Bartlett's can't be beat. However, there's another site for Mathematical Quotations. 
Want to see a movie in Lincoln? Maybe you should check out some reviews first (from MetroMix Chicago Entertainment Guide). 
For driving directions, check out MapQuest. 
You can use LATEX2HTML to convert LaTeX files into webpages. 
Check out the online Merriam-Webster Dictionary for all your spelling and definition needs! You can also improve your vocabulary with their Word-of-the-Day page. While you're at it, maybe you should do a Daily Crossword (brought to you by iVillage.com). 
Francis Su, a Project NExT Blue Dot at Harvey Mudd, put together a page of Top of Page
