Luke's Web Page 
Latest News: 
01/31/04 New Recipe page. Hopefully I'll work on this more as time goes on. 	
10/30/03 Check out my NEW Text America blog. This will probably replace my Hiptop Nation blog permanently, as it has more features and allows me to add pictures besides those from my phone. I can also edit entries in case I make any spellling errors (^; 	
08/14/03 New picture of Me. Dressed like a moron to try to win hawaiian day at work. I took the picture myself. Also updated the Hiptop page with more RED Line times 	
07/29/03 New DVD Review. The All Thumbs collection. I've had it for a while, realized it would fill in the gap on my DVD page. Take a look! 	
12/28/02 New picture of Me. Got a new car! Take a look of it before it's all dirty! 	
12/27/02 New pictures of Me. Two pictures from my recent graduation from Texas A&M University. Merry Christmas everyone!
