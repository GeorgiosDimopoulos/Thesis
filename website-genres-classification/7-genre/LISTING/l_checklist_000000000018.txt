Print friendly format
There are so many things to think about when moving! Here's a comprehensive checklist to help you stay on track. 
8 Weeks Before Moving 
* Create a "move file" to keep track of estimates, receipts and other important information. 
* Check with the IRS to see what expenses can be deducted on your next tax return. 
* Start researching your new community. The Internet is a great resource for finding online community guides and newspapers. 
* Contact your new Chamber of Commerce for their new resident packet. 
* Draw out a floor plan of your new home and start deciding which function each room with serve. 
* Budget for moving expenses and start collecting estimates - including a quote from ABF U-Pack Moving®. 
* Read up on moving tips and topics at our Moving Resource Center. 
7 Weeks Before Moving
* Start pulling together medical and dental records - including prescriptions and shot records. Ask your existing doctors if they can refer you to a care provider in your new city. 
* Arrange to have school records transferred to your children's new school district and/or daycare. 
* Get copies of any legal and financial records you need. 
* Arrange for veterinarian records to be transferred. 
* Call your insurance agent to see what changes to expect in your policies for changing states. Ask if moving is covered and arrange for insurance for your new home. 
* Contact health clubs or other organizations you have joined. Ask how you can end, sell or transfer your membership.
6 Weeks Before Moving
* Make a list of things that are valuable or difficult to replace. Plan on shipping these by certified mail or carrying them with you. 
* Make a list of friends, relatives and businesses who need to be notified of your move. 
* Start working your way through each room taking inventory and deciding what to get rid of. Start planning a yard sale or contact your local charities. 
* Think about subscribing to the newspaper in your new hometown to start learning about events and the local culture. 
* Start to use things that can't be moved, such as frozen foods, bleach and aerosol cleaners. 
5 Weeks Before Moving
* Start collecting boxes and other packing supplies. You can order a wide selection of boxes from U-Pack to be delivered to your door. 
* Start packing items you don't use often. Also start disposing of the items you've designated for a yard sale, donation or the junk yard. If you donate, be sure to get a receipt for income tax purposes. 
* Start pinpointing a "drop date" for your ABF® trailer. This will be the day you receive your trailer and have it left for loading. Try to take advantage of the lower rates offered Tuesdays through Thursdays and during the first three weeks of the month. 
* Plan ahead for parking. Remember you'll be receiving a 28 foot commercial trailer, which will require a 14 foot overhead clearance. You may need your reserved space for up to two business days and should contact your property manager or local authorities to ensure you will be complying with any rules or restrictions. 
* Plan for short-term or long-term storage at destination if needed.
4 Weeks Before Moving
* Reserve your ABF trailer online or by calling 1-800-240-7422. This should be done at least three days before your move, or earlier for increased convenience. ABF has ramps for rental that you can reserve at the time of reservation.  If you will need other loading equipment, make reservations with a local equipment-rental yard. 
* File a change of address. If you are unsure of your new address will be, ask the postal service to hold your mail in their office in your new city. 
* Schedule disconnection of all utility services at your old home, and connection of them at your new one. Be sure to disconnect the day after you leave and connect the day before you arrive. If you have "last month" deposits with services, such as the water or gas company, request your refund. 
* Make travel arrangements for your pets, do not forget to include necessary medical and immunization records. 
* Advertise and host your garage sale. 
* Call your newspaper courier and set a date to cancel your subscription. 
3 Weeks Before Moving
* Make sure all library books have been returned and all dry cleaning or items out for repair have been picked up.  Also retrieve any items out on loan. 
* Contact your utility companies on both ends of the move to order dates for termination or turn-on. 
* Decide if you will keep your plants or give them away. Remember plants cannot be loaded with your other household goods. 
* Dispose of flammables, corrosives and poisons. 
* Have your automobile(s) serviced. 
* Prepare auto registration to be transferred. 
* If you are moving into or out of an apartment, arrange to use the elevator on your move day.
2 Weeks Before Moving
* Contact your bank and/or credit union to transfer or close accounts. Clear out safety deposit boxes. Pick up traveler's checks or cash for "on the road" expenses. 
* Confirm travel arrangements for pets and family. 
* Confirm parking for your trailer. 
* Notify any creditors of your move. 
* Plan meals for the last week of the move to help empty the refrigerator and avoid using appliances that will already be packed. 
* Assemble a folder of important information about the house for the new owner of your home.
1 Week Before Moving
* Finish packing and prepare an "essentials" box. Designate several boxes and items as "last load" items. Pack your suitcases and valuables separately. 
* Drain all gas and oil from your mower and other motors. Gas grills, kerosene heaters, etc. need to be emptied as well. 
* Drain water hoses and waterbed. 
* Empty, defrost and clean your refrigerator at least 24 hours before moving day. Prepare all appliances for loading. 
* One or two business days before your move, contact your local ABF terminal to confirm a time to receive your trailer. 
* Fill any prescriptions or medications you will need for the next couple of weeks. 
* Make childcare arrangements for moving day. 
* Notify friends and family of your new address and phone number.
Moving Out
* It is necessary for you to be present when ABF delivers your trailer. You will need to show the driver where you want the trailer parked and sign for delivery. 
* Inspect your trailer for cleanliness and leaks before signing for delivery. 
* Measure your space on the trailer, so you know where your boundary is. If you need more or less space, you can take it and simply adjust your base rate by your "per foot" charge. 
* You are ultimately responsible for how your goods are packed and loaded in your trailer. Be familiar with our packing and loading tips  and personally supervise hired labor. 
* Load your goods in a pre-designated order, saving "last load" items for the rear of your shipment. This might include your vacuum cleaner or bed sheets. 
* Check every room, closet and cabinet one last time before deciding everything is loaded. 
* Once your goods are loaded, install the bulkhead. 
* Take note of utility meter readings. 
* You should have received a copy of your Bill of Lading, or BOL, when you received your trailer. Look this document over carefully and contact your moving coordinator with any questions or concerns. 
* Make sure the destination address and contact information on your BOL is correct and write in the number of feet taken by your shipment. This is very important, as an accurate BOL ensures an accurate rate. 
* Call the local ABF terminal when your trailer is ready to be picked up. 
* When ABF picks up your trailer, verify the footage with the driver and sign the BOL. 
* The day after your trailer is picked up call your local terminal to verify charges and to get your "pro" or tracking number. You can use this number to track your shipment around the clock, by calling 1-800-FOR-ABFS. 
* Leave a note with your new address in the house so that future residents can forward any stray mail. 
* Keep a friend or family member informed of your plans and "whereabouts" in case of an emergency or unforeseen event. 
Moving In
* You are likely to arrive at your new home ahead of your shipment. Take this time to look things over and to ensure your new utilities have been connected. 
* Check appliances and systems to ensure all are working properly, and arrange for repairs if necessary. 
* Check to see if your mail is making it to your new address or pick up any mail being held. 
* Consider drawing out your new floor plan and decide where you want furniture and appliances placed. 
* Keep track of your shipment and work with the local terminal to schedule delivery of your trailer. Plan ahead for parking. 
* As at origin, make a point to be present when ABF delivers your trailer. Show the driver where you want the trailer parked and sign for delivery. If you are unable to do this, work closely with a friend or representative to accept your shipment. 
* Unless you are paying by credit card, have a cashier's check or money order ready for the driver. 
* After your goods are unloaded, contact your local terminal to have your trailer taken away. Be sure to remove all debris, leaving only the bulkhead in the trailer. 
After the Move
* Keep all receipts and documentation in your move file and store the file in a safe place. Be sure to include your Bill of Lading and delivery receipt. You'll be glad to have everything in one place at tax time. 
* Get a new driver's license and new tags for your automobile. 
* Register to vote. 
* Contact the local paper for a new subscription.
