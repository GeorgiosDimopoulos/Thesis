Thanks for all of your support, and here's to a great year of     adventure racing!

I've enrolled us in the Amazon.com Honor System -     it lets you donate as much or as little (well, at least a dollar) as you'd like     to FROG to help pay for the web page, BYC gear, club liability insurance, and     administrative stuff. The web page and insurance fees together are about     $400/year. The last 2 years we've cleared that with dues and BYC fees. I hope     this new model + any BYC fees we collect will keep my own bank account from     getting tapped too much, and it should be a heck of a lot easier to keep up     with, too.
