Short C.V.: 

I was born in early 1955 in Offenbach am Main, where the family lived until 1966/67. Then we moved to Mühlheim am Main-Lämmerspiel (at that time Lämmerspiel still was an independent village, before it became incorporated to Mühlheim). 

Already as a 12-year old boy I found my interest in Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), which were still thriving well at around here those days (nowadays most butterflies are gone due to pollution, growth of human activities and other anthropogeneous factors, while the moths are still strong here). As far as my time permits, I am still interested in Lepidoptera faunistics of Mühlheim and surroundings. 

In 1973, after finishing school (Abitur at Friedrich-Ebert-Gymnasium in Mühlheim), I started  the study of chemistry, later of biology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, which lead to the academic degree of Diplombiologe (corresponding to a MSc in biology) (with focus on entomology) and later a PhD in biology (subject: A revision of the genus Cricula) under Prof. Dr. Ulrich Maschwitz. 

In 1979 I became a member of the entomological society Entomologischer Verein Apollo, Frankfurt am Main, founded in 1897. During the 1980ies I became more and more involved into the editorial business for the journal Â„Nachrichten des Entomologischen Vereins ApolloÂ“ (NEVA); since ca. 1985 I am officially managing editor of that journal within the Editorial Board. The NEVA is nowadays one of the great and important entomological journals (with special emphasis on Lepidoptera) on the amateur market in Germany (see also the list of contents or Gesamtverzeichnis of the NEVA and the History of NEVA [in German  only]). 

After finishing my diploma and before I got the job at Senckenberg I earned my money for over a decade (in absence of adequate scientific job opportunities) in the newspaper printing industry (Frankfurter Societätsdruckerei) in the technical area as proof reader (besides others, for Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) with a part-time job (two days a week), allowing me to make progress in my research activities. The typographic experiences from that time were always used in my work for NEVA and are still very helpful. 

In 1985 I was one of the founders of the Study Group of Hessian Lepidopterologists (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Hessischen Lepidopterologen, in short Arge HeLep; combining amateur and professional lepidopterologists of Hesse) under the auspices of I.E.V. and in cooperation with Apollo. The faunistic study group Arge HeLep undertakes (besides other activities) the compilation of red data lists (Â“Rote ListenÂ”) for the State of Hesse in the name of the State Government. Arge HeLep is also a member of the Hessian Organisation of Faunistic Study Groups (FLAGH). 

Since December 1995 I am scientific employee (Head of Section Entomology II) at the Forschungsinstitut und Naturmuseum Senckenberg (the natural history museum and research centre) in Frankfurt am Main. In 1998 I became managing editor of the scientific biological journal Â“Senckenbergiana biologicaÂ”. Â— Already in 1976 I became a member of the Senckenberg Society (Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft). 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
My scientific work comprises (see the links for further details): 

* Studies on systematics, taxonomy, phylogeny, ecology and morphology of the Bombycoidea (a group of nocturnal Lepidoptera, moths) 
(These studies are concentrated on the superfamily Bombycoidea, especially the family Saturniidae. During studies on these families I also made several research trips to different tropical countries, especially in SE Asia. I was coauthor for two books about the Saturniidae of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and of the Philippines.) 

* Further information on some of these projects can be found on the pages of the Senckenbergian section Entomology II or under www.saturnia.de, where also these two books (and more) are illustrated and described in more detail. 

and 

* Studies on the Hessian Lepidoptera fauna 

* Lepidoptera faunistics of selected areas and on a state-wide scale 
* scientific studies on nature reserves management 
* collaboration in the production of Â“red data listsÂ” of Lepidoptera of Hesse 
* compiling a Â“State Collection of Hessian LepidopteraÂ” within the Senckenberg-Museum 
* coordination of the work of the Arge HeLep as one of four speakers 

A list of my scientific publications can be found here.

Activities in nature conservancy: 

During the recent years I worked in the neighbourhood of Mühlheim especially on the Lepidoptera faunistics of some nature reserves (for private and governmental nature conservancy organisations) in the districts (Kreise) of Offenbach and Main-Kinzig. I also worked in the municipal forest of Frankfurt, and the data obtained there will be used as arguments against the planned expansion of the Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport into these indispensable remnants of the forest (for futher details see here, in German language only). 

Besides many national and international societies in entomology and biology I am also for many years a member in the active nature conservancy organisations of Germany: Nabu, BUND, and HGON. For the NAOM in nearby Obertshausen I am externally supervising the species determinations of Lepidoptera for some projects. 

Since November 1997 I am deputy member for Senckenberg of the municipal council for nature conservancy problems (Naturschutzbeirat, 5th period) of the city of Frankfurt am Main.

Private interests: 
As far as my time permits, I still have a fewprivate interests: 
  

Science  
  Fiction 

See also the following links: 

Perry Rhodan Â— the most successful printed German weekly SF series, which I sometimes (rarely) still read; I began this in 1967, the series itself started in 1961 and is still going strong (and  reached volume 2000 just a few days before the begin of the year 2000!).	 

Most impressive for me in my teen ages were the (only!) 7 episodes of the German TV series Raumpatrouille Orion (Space Patrol Orion); see here, here or here (in German). 	 

. . . and of course also Startrek, of which I prefer the more recent sequences (although I prefer to see the movies and not the websites);	 

see also the very informative Database Yentz on Startrek (mainly in German),
Â— this address seems to have gone lost for a longer period now, I do not know a new URL.	 

or just in the Â“Alternate UniverseÂ”. 
Â— this is no more what it was; plain business now!	 

Sometimes with an even better story than Star Trek: Babylon 5. 	 

Although only available in books, with an amazing amount of fan activities in the WWW: Anne McCaffreyÂ’s Dragon Riders of Pern. See here, here or here.	 

A fairy tale, but well done: the Star Wars episodes.	 

See as well KiraÂ’s Holosuite (by Barbara Müller, Frankfurt am Main; still under construction for quite long a time now ...).
