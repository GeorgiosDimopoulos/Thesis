All my pages will be unavailable on July 10 while the Earlham College server undergoes routine maintenance. I apologize for the inconvenience. Peter . --> Welcome to my collection of knotting resources. A little knot news content here//////////////// Happy knotting, Peter --> My major sections are on Knot Tying , Knot Theory , and Knot Art . But knot lovers will understand that these distinctions are artificial. For example, a good practical knot is both a nugget of hard-won technology and a thing of beauty. Decorative knotting can be useful, and in any case requires uncommon dexterity and practical tying ability. Software developed to help mathematical knot theorists has produced some of the most beautiful knot images ever seen. So look at all three sections even if you think your interests are narrow. You might become happily entangled. My fourth section is on Knot Discussion . Use these discussion forums to find answers to your knotting questions and to help others who know less than you do. My fifth section is on Knot Software . You'll be surprised at how knotting software can make it easier for you to learn to tie knots, to explore the mathematical properties of knots, and to create stunning images of knots, including knots never seen on Earth. My sixth section is on Knot Videos . If written instructions and still photos don't explain the intricacies of knotting well enough for you, try some of these videos (or some instructional software ). My seventh section is on Knot Books . Click on these links to buy knotting classics from Amazon.com. I've designed this section to aim for excellence, not completeness. It's limited to books I can personally recommend. My eighth section is a Knot Gallery to display the images from rec.crafts.knots , the only usenet newsgroup devoted to knots. To find something in particular, wait for the whole page to load and then use the search function on your browser. This will cover all my sections except the Knot Gallery , and my site awards , which are in separate files. Open links in new windows.

You've probably heard about Yong Mao and Thomas Fink , the two physicists from Cambridge's prestigious Cavendish Laboratory who turned from physics, even from respectable knot theory, to necktie theory. Because they published their mathematical analysis of necktie knots in the equally prestigious journal Nature (vol. 398, pp. 31-32, March 4, 1999), their new knots have become the biggest knot story in the mainstream press since the supposed discovery of the Hunter's Bend in 1978.

For prices, click through on a title of interest. Here in the book section, the flag means that a book is new to my page, not that it is newly published. Books on Knot Tying The Alternative Knot Book , by Harry Asher , Sheridan House, 1989. Instead of simply giving instructions on the basic knots, Asher offers a theory of knot classification based on the similarities of knots to one another, and teaches the knots in their natural order. Paperback. The only other book of this kind that I know is, unfortunately, not available from Amazon.com. It is A Fresh Approach to Knotting and Ropework: Knots Arranged According to Their Structure , by Charles Warner , published by Charles Warner (Picton, Australia), 1992. Of the two, Asher's is shorter and simpler; Warner's more extensive and sophisticated. Paperback. --> The Ashley Book of Knots , by Clifford W. Ashley , Doubleday, 1944 (reissued 1993). If you are interested in practical knots and knot tying, this is the one book to own. Ashley collected knots from every occupation, illustrated them by hand, and described them in his concise and salty prose. His collection of 3,900 knots and 7,000 illustrations is unrivaled for scope and utility, even today. All knotting literature refers to it. Unusual knots without names are typically cited by their Ashley number. To make a prima facie case that a knot is a new creation, one need only show that it does not appear in Ashley. It makes a great read for the knotting lore interspersed among the technical instructions and the window it provides onto many fascinating past forms of manual labor. Because the knots for (say) square-rigged sailing ships, stevedores, steeplejacks, and draymen have been made obsolete by modern tecchnologies, the book is of immense historical value, even if these knots were not transferable to other applications. Ashley has his weaknesses, but these quickly become part of the charm of the book. For example, are some of his instructions confusing, or is he simply overestimating our intelligence and experience? Hardback only. My views are clear. If you can only buy one knotting book, buy Ashley's. There are a hundred knotting primers and collections shorter and less interesting than Ashley's. Most of them are not worth buying if you already own Ashley. But the best of them, while less comprehensive than Ashley, have their own advantages which make them useful even alongside Ashley. In this select company, I would put Bigon and Regazzoni (1982), Budworth (1997), Budworth (1999), Fry (1996), Pawson (1998), Toss (1990), and Toss (1998), all of which are listed below. The Art of Rigging , by George Biddlecombe , Dover Publications, 1990 (original 1925). If you think you know knots but can't tell your keckling from your kevels, your jiggers from your jib-guys, your gammoning from your gripes, or your catheads from your catherpins, then you need this book. It's the first I've seen that doesn't presuppose that you already know. Paperback. The Morrow Guide to Knots , by Mario Bigon and Guido Regazzoni , translated by Maria Piotrowska, William Morrow & Co., 1982 (Italian original 1981). A first-rate book, one of the best for the 70 knots it covers. Unusually clear illustrations, using color photographs of colored cord. Contains some rare and useful knots hard to find elsewhere, such as a bowline when the standing part is under tension (pp. 80-81) and the self-locking Poldo tackle (p. 118). One of the best collections after Ashley. Paperback. The Knot Book , by Geoffrey Budworth , Sterling Publishers, 1985. More comprehensive than most of the general collections of useful knots, with exceptionally clear descriptions and illustrations, by one of the greatest living experts on knotcraft. But for even better books by the same author, see the next two titles. Paperback. The Complete Book of Knots , by Geoffrey Budworth , Lyons & Burford, 1997. This is an elegant and useful book. The word "Complete" in the title is the only false note. It covers all the well-known knots and an unusually large number of lesser-known knots, new knots, and knot tricks. (He is the only major knot compiler who acknowledges that new knots are still being discovered.) The instructions and illustrations are very clear. Budworth includes a brief historical note on each knot, and a useful table on the best knots for different spheres sailing, fishing, climbing, and so on. One of the best collections after Ashley. Paperback. The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots and Ropework by Geoffrey Budworth , Lorenz Books, 1999. How do you top the misnamed Complete Book of Knots? With the misnamed Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots. This book is the first lush, coffee-table book of knots ever published. It's not as comprehensive as it appears, with 256 pages (to Ashley's 620) and roughly one knot per page (to Ashley's 5-7). The large, color photographs are more beautiful (for knot fanciers) than instructive. The knots are well-chosen from all fields and are marked with icons for their common applications. A worthy collection, but Budworth is starting to repeat himself. Hardback. The Forensic Analysis of Knots and Ligatures , by Robert Chisnall , Lightning Powder Co., 2000. If you're reading this page, then you're probably among the top knotting experts in your town. Hence, you may eventually be asked by police to help analyze knots and ligatures left at crime scenes to learn what they reveal about the person who tied them. Chisnall's book is the best ever written on the subject and the only one still in print. Knotting experise is not enough to do well in this field. You need Chisnall's many years of experience dealing with murder, suicide, and accident, working with police, preserving evidence, and testifying in court. Hardback. Climbing knots . Also see the rope rescue books . Climbing is too dangerous for you to rely on your knotting common sense. Many classic knots that work beautifully in fiber rope, with its high friction, slip in modern synthetic climbing rope. Some useful climbing knots, like the Munter Hitch and Klemheist, simply aren't known in other domains like sailing or fishing. Carabiners make some knots unnecessary and at the same time give rise to the need for creative new knots. Finally, climbers often tie in with flat nylon webbing, which raises new knotting challenges not always covered by the knots evolved for leather straps. These are the main reasons why climbing-specific knot books are useful. Knots for Climbers , by Craig Luebben , Chockstone Press, 1995. Short, clear, and well-illustrated. Paperback. Climbing Knots For Lefties and Righties , by John McMullen , ICS Books, 1997. Not only one of the most thorough and best-illustrated of climbing knot books, but the only knot book of any kind I've seen that gives more than a passing nod to left- and right-handed versions of practical knots. Paperback. Knots and Ropes for Climbers , by Duane Raleigh , Stackpole Books, 1998. Roughly as thorough as Luebben, less thorough than McMullen. Has longer prose commentaries on each knot than either of the other books. Clear illustrations. Paperback. The Art of Knotting and Splicing , by Cyrus L. Day , Naval Institute Press, 4th ed., 1987 (first edition, 1947). A jumbo knotting guide illustrated with black and white photographs, brought up to date (especially for synthetic cord) by Ray O. Beard, Jr. and M. Lee Hoffman, Jr. Large enough to contain tips and tricks the ordinary primers and manuals cannot include. Paperback. Knots and Splices , by Cyrus L. Day , International Marine, 1953. A thin, short classic. Combines a good selection of knots with black and white photographs. The photographs are not as clear as those in contemporary books, but are clear enough. Still worth buying if you need to fit your knotting manual into your pocket. Paperback. The Complete Book of Knots and Ropework , by Eric C. Fry , David and Charles, 1996. Another good book by a knotter who knows better than to use the word "Complete" in the title (see Budworth 1997 above). Ninety-five knots well-illustrated with black-and-white photographs. Unlike other general knot manuals, this one gives half its space (as opposed to a quarter or less) to decorative knots. This book reprints Fry's Knots and Ropework and Practical and Decorative Ropework in a single volume. Paperback. The Complete Guide To Knots and How To Tie Them , by Walter F. Gibson , Lifetime Books, 1997 (original 1961). Gibson is yet another knowledgeable knottist who doesn't know what "complete" means. More inclusive than the run-of-the-mill collections I omit from my book list, but not as thorough or well-illustrated as most that I do list. About a third of the book is devoted to magic tricks. Stage Rigging Handbook , by Jay O. Glerum , Southern Illinois University Press, second ed., 1997 (original, 1987). Detailed instruction in all the knots, ropework, and hardware needed to rig a theatrical stage, plus the mathematics for calculating loads and forces. The definitive handbook for this field. Paperback. KnotCraft: The Practical and Entertaining Art of Tying Knots , by Allan and Paulette Macfarlan , Dover Publications, 1967 (original 1967). What sets this book apart from other short collections of useful knots is the well-researched introductory chapter on the history of knotting, many illustrated applications for different knots (as opposed to the knots themselves), and sections on knot games and magic. Paperback. The Handbook of Knots , by Des Pawson , DK Publishing, Inc., 1998. An excellent handbook by one of the co-founders of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. A very wide selection of knots, very well-illustrated with color photographs of colored cord. Each knot is described and photographed in several steps. One of the best knot collections after Ashley. Bound in stiff, flexible covers to withstand wear and tear. (For a while my link took you to the wrong book in Amazon.com. I've fixed it. My apologies to Des Pawson and those who wanted to buy his book.) Rope magic If you are reading this, then you probably carry a hank of cord in your pocket wherever you go. If you do, you might as well know a few tricks. But even if you don't like to astound your friends, there are some nice tricks in these books that have helped me in my (pathetically unsuccessful) assault on the world knot tying speed record . Fun With String , by Joseph Leeming , Dover Publications, 1974 (original 1940). Most of the "fun" is rope magic, but some is ordinary knotting and knot crafts. Paperback. Self-Working Rope Magic , by Karl Fulves , Dover Publications, 1990. More illustrations per trick than other magic books. Paperback. Abbott's Encyclopedia of Rope Tricks for Magicians , by Stewart James , Dover Publications, 1975 (original 1945). Named "Abbott's" after the original publisher. At 400 pages, this is the most thorough collection of rope tricks I've seen. Paperback. Magic with Rope, Robbon, & String , by Bill Severn , Stackpole Books, 1982. Clear and well-illustrated. Paperback. Some of the other books I list in the Knot Tying section (notably, Ashley , Gibson , and the Macfarlans ) also contain a good selection of knot tricks. By the way, the single best knot trick I've ever found is at pp. 98-99 of Louis Kauffman's On Knots , a mathematical treatise listed below with the books on knot theory . I'm sure you've seen the trick in which someone ties an overhand knot by crossing their arms before picking up the cord, and then uncrossing them. Kauffman shows you how to do the same trick without crossing your arms first. The version of this trick in Ashley #2576 and Budworth 1977 [p. 151] is not nearly as good. Rope rescue . Also see the climbing knot books . Books on rope rescue contain ordinary knots, climbing knots, some knots rarely used elsewhere, and comprehensive coverage of harnesses, anchors, and rigging for rescues under many different circumstances. Unlike most knot books, which simply show the tying steps for a selection of knots out of context, these books show the knots and rigging procedures in action, with tips on safety, alternatives, and when to apply what. As in climbing, this is an area where the stakes are high and learning from the experience of others can make the difference between life and death. Engineering Practical Rope Rescue Systems , by Michael G. Brown , Delmar, 2000. A large book (322 oversized pages) on the full-scope of rope rescue, emphasizing the practical. It avoids asserting that there is just one way to rig a given rescue, and shows the safety and speed issues which would help you choose among alternatives. It is one of the few books willing to disclose mistakes in earlier books, and to go beyond the basics on some technical subjects, e.g. the metallurgy of rescue hardware, legal and professional regulations, and highlines. Illustrated with black-and-white drawings and photographs. Paperback. CMC Rope Rescue , edited by James A. Frank , CMC Rescue Inc., 1998. A large book (208 oversized pages) on rope rescue in nearly all settings. This makes it more general than the specialized works below, which is a plus if you want orientation or flexibility, a minus if you work in a special field of rope rescue. Black-and-white drawings. Paperback. Swiftwater Rescue: A Manual for the Rescue Professional , by Slim Ray , CFS Press, 1997. A large book (243 oversized papges) covering its special topic, rescue from whitewater rivers and floods, in great detail. Many black-and-white drawings and a few photographs. Paperback. Confined Space and Structural Rope Rescue , by Michael Roop, Thomas Vines, and Richard Wright , Mosby-Year Book, 1998. Color drawings and photographs illustrate this large book (384 oversized pages), focused on rescues from confined spaces and other difficult locations. Paperback. On Rope: North American Vertical Rope Techniques , by Bruce Smith and Allen Padgett , National Speleological Society, new edition, 1996. A large book (382 oversized pages) on rope techniques for vertical ascents and descents, for example in "caving, search and rescue, firefighting, rope rescue, mountaineering, window cleaning, river runners, rock climbing, aborists, event riggers, military operations, challenge courses, nautical applications, and rappellers" to quote the title page. Numerous black-and-white drawings and a few photos. Very detailed text. (The "new edition" of 1996 and the "second edition" of 1997 are apparently the same; at least they have the same ISBN.) Hardback only. Nautical Knots and Lines Illustrated , by Paul and Arthur Snyder , International Marine, 1997. A short book with some material not covered in longer books on the standard knots. Clear black and white photographs, several per knot to show successive stages. Paperback. Knowing the Ropes: A Sailor's Guide to Selecting, Rigging, and Handling Lines Aboard , by Roger C. Taylor , International Marine, second edition, 1993. Goes well beyond the basic boating knots. Covers essentially all the applications for rope on shipboard, with abundant detail on technique, efficiency, and safety. Clear black and white drawings. Paperback. Chapman's Nautical Guides: Knots , by Brion Toss , Hearst Marine Books, 1990. A remarkably clear and useful handbook of boating knots, more comprehensive than other knotting books limited to one domain (more than 100 knots covered). Bound in flexible covers to stand up to the wear of a working life. Lucid illustrations by Gae Pilon. One of the best collections after Ashley. For Toss's magnum opus , see the next entry. The Complete Rigger's Apprentice , by Brion Toss , International Marine, 1998. Toss's Rigger's Apprentice and Rigger's Locker reprinted (and synthesized) in a single volume. Toss is the only contemporary writer who can compare to Clifford Ashley and Hervey Garrett Smith in technical knowledge, literary skill, and nautical authenticity. These very recent books are already classics. Loaded with knowledge and lore one fears is slipping away, even if elegantly preserved in books like this one. Illustrated with wit by Robert Shetterly. One of the few must-have books after Ashley. Hardback only. Books on Knot Theory The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots , by Colin C. Adams , W.H. Freeman and Co., 1994. One of the two best introductions to mathematical knot theory (with Livingston, below). Introduces all the basic terms and concepts, with well-designed exercises. Also includes open questions to challenge advanced readers. Hardback only. Knots and Surfaces , by N.D. Gilbert and T. Porter , Oxford University Press, 1997 (original 1994). An introduction to knot theory and the topology of surfaces, showing their connections to one another and to such related fields as graph theory and group theory. Clearly written and illustrated. Presupposes no knot theory and only undergraduate mathematics. Paperback. On Knots , by Louis H. Kauffman , Princeton University Press, 1987. A serious treatise that I recommended above for a great knotting magic trick at pp. 98-99. Not an introduction to knot theory, except for the mathematically able. If you've read one of the good introductions (by Adams or Livingston, for example) and want more, this is a good book to try. Wonderfully apt and playful illustrations. Hardback only. Knot Theory , by Charles Livingston , Mathematical Association of America, 1993. One of the two best general introductions to mathematical knot theory (with Adams, above). Illuminates the field from the perspectives of geometry, combinatorics, and algebra. Hardback only. Symmetric Bends: How to Join Two Lengths of Cord , by Roger E. Miles , World Scientific Publishing Co., 1995. A fascinating mix of mathematics and practical knot-tying. Miles gives the mathematics of the symmetric bends (like the Hunter's bend and the Zeppelin bend), sixty variations on the theme, and instructions for inventing new ones. Hardback only. Knots and Links , by Dale Rolfsen , Publish or Perish, Inc., 1976. One of the classic textbooks in the field. Clear and thorough, but (like Kauffman) not an introduction except for those with a mathematical background. Especially helpful is the appendix (by James Bailey and Ali Roth) on prime knots and links. Paperback. Knots , by Alexei Sossinsky . The most readable introduction I've seen. What it lacks in thoroughness, it provides in clarity. Very readable introductions to a miscellany of knot theory topics from the elementary to the somewhat advanced. If it were more thorough or systematic, I'd rank it among the best introductions to the field. Hardback. History and Science of Knots , edited by J. C. Turner and P. Van De Griend , World Scientific Publishing Co., 1996. This is the most gratifying book on knots to be published in a long time. It proves that knotting by prehistoric peoples can be studied. It proves that knotting can be regarded as one of the earliest and most widespread technologies on which civilization depends. It's expensive ( $ 78) and only available in hardback. But if you always knew that there was more to the study of knots than either the knot-tying manuals or the mathematical treatises let on, but didn't know where to put your hands on it, here it is. Hardback only. Books on Knot Art Celtic Knotwork , by Iain Bain , Sterling Pub. Co., 1992. A step-by-step guide for beginners, emphasizing the construction of grids to fit the shape in which you'll be working. Lovely drawn illustrations of the techniques, photographs of historical specimens. Becomes quite advanced by the end. Paperback. The Complete Book of Decorative Knots , by Geoffrey Budworth , The Lyons Press, 1998. A thorough guide to decorative knots with sections on lanyard knots, button and globe knots, Turk's heads, mats and hitching, and plaits and braids. (Thorough does not mean "complete", as Budworth and his publisher should know.) Clear drawings, usually many per knot. In addition to instructions, each knot is accompanied by a few words on its applications and history. Paperback. Chinese Knotting , by Lydia Chen , Echo Books, n.d. An ancient and beautiful art, almost destroyed by the Cultural Revolution. Lydia Chen has done more than anyone else to preserve and revive it. Stunning color photographs of classical and contemporary examples, many of the best by the author herself. Distinctively Chinese and quite different from Western decorative knotting. This is the book that persuaded me that "decorative knotting" is a true art, not mere decoration. Hardback only. If you like Chen's book, you will also like Hanamusubi: Traditional Japanese Flower-Knots by Toshiko Tanaka , Kyoto Shoin Co., Ltd., 1993. Paperback. Unfortunately, Tanaka's book is not available from Amazon.com. Encyclopedia of Knots and Fancy Rope Work , by Raoul Graumont and John Hensel , Cornell Maritime Press, 4th ed., 1952. Over 700 pages of knot descriptions and photographs. There are better books for practical knots, but for decorative knots it is unrivaled in its scope and detail. Hardback only. The Book of Ornamental Knots , by John J. Hensel , Cornell Maritime Press, 1990 (Original, 1973). Hensel is the co-author of the Encyclopedia of Knots and Fancy Rope Work (above). While the larger work is more like a museum, this one is much more a primer. A good introduction to large knotting projects (belts, mats, wall hangings) by one of the masters. Illustrated with black and white photographs. Paperback. Celtic Design: Knotwork: The Secret Method of the Scribes , by Aidan Meehan , Thames and Hudson, 1991. A step-by-step guide for beginners. Elegant illustrations and calligraphy by the author. Builds up to some complex designs. Paperback. The Book of Decorative Knots , by Peter Owen , Lyons & Burford, 1994. This is the best introductory book I've seen on decorative knots. It's not encyclopedic, it's not intimidating, and it presupposes no knotting sophistication. Short with clear black and white line drawings and concise descriptions. (Having said that, it wouldn't take much practice for the beginner to outgrow this book.) Paperback. How to Draw Celtic Knotwork , by Andy Sloss , Blandford Books, 1995. Unlike the other Celtic knotting books listed here (by Bain, Meehan, and Sturrock), Sloss breaks Celtic knotting designs down into the distinct lines and square modules which may be combined to make complex designs. Because each line and module can be named, he produces a notation for arbitrary patterns. The modules are illusrated for hand-drawing and computer graphics. Paperback. The Arts of the Sailor , by Hervey Garrett Smith , Dover Publications, 1990 (original 1953). This book is about half and half practical knots and sailors' knot art. I've arbitrarily decided to list it with the art books. Smith is like Ashley in that he draws his own, very clear illustrations, and writes with the authentic saltiness of an old sailor. This is one of the few knot books that is as enjoyable to read as it is to use. Smith wrote a subsequent book, The Marlinspike Sailor (International Marine, 1993, original 1960) that covers much the same ground as Arts of the Sailor , but with a slightly greater tilt toward artful knotting. It also has a useful appendix on splicing woven, synthetic cord. Both are paperbacks. Celtic Knotwork Designs , by Sheila Sturrock , Guild of Master Craftsman Publications, Ltd., 1997. A step-by-step guide for beginners. Handsome illustrations. Paperback. Amazon.com also pays me a referral fee for the books and other products you buy as a result of searching its catalog with the following search box. The products need not pertain to knots at all. I donate all my referral fees to the Caroline Robinson Beasley Fund at Earlham College to help needy students buy textbooks.

Welcome to my collection of knotting resources. 

My major sections are on Knot Tying, Knot Theory, and Knot Art. But knot lovers will understand that these distinctions are artificial. For example, a good practical knot is both a nugget of hard-won technology and a thing of beauty. Decorative knotting can be useful, and in any case requires uncommon dexterity and practical tying ability. Software developed to help mathematical knot theorists has produced some of the most beautiful knot images ever seen. So look at all three sections even if you think your interests are narrow. You might become happily entangled. 

My fourth section is on Knot Discussion. Use these discussion forums to find answers to your knotting questions and to help others who know less than you do. 

My fifth section is on Knot Software. You'll be surprised at how knotting software can make it easier for you to learn to tie knots, to explore the mathematical properties of knots, and to create stunning images of knots, including knots never seen on Earth. 

My sixth section is on Knot Videos. If written instructions and still photos don't explain the intricacies of knotting well enough for you, try some of these videos (or some instructional software). 

My seventh section is on Knot Books. Click on these links to buy knotting classics from Amazon.com. I've designed this section to aim for excellence, not completeness. It's limited to books I can personally recommend. 

My eighth section is a Knot Gallery to display the images from rec.crafts.knots, the only usenet newsgroup devoted to knots. 

To find something in particular, wait for the whole page to load and then use the search function on your browser. This will cover all my sections except the Knot Gallery, and my site awards, which are in separate files. Open links in new windows.

General. Also see the discussion forums, software, videos, and books on knot tying. 
* The International Guild of Knot Tyers. This is the organization to join if you are a serious knot tyer. Its journal, Knotting Matters, is the only English-language print journal devoted exclusively to knots. 
* The North American Branch has its own web page. The NAB publishes the InterKnot newsletter. (Interknot was formerly on the web, but the link is now dead. Does anyone know whether it's gone for good?) 
* The Pacific Americas Branch has its own own page. 
* The Texas Branch also has its own page. 
* There are many other branches without their own web sites. 

* Het Knoopeknauwertje. The English-language International Edition of the Dutch knotting journal. Apparently defunct. I'm still investigating what happened to it. 
* Nylon Highway. The magazine of rope, climbing, and cave exploration. From the Vertical Section of the National Speleological Society. The back issues do not exist in electronic form. Recent issues are online but only accessible to paying subscribers 
* Ropers Knots Page. Maintained by Ed Prins. The most thorough page of links to knot sites, except possibly mine; but he includes some sites I omit and vice versa. Also available in Dutch. Now contains an ambitious Knot Index, an alphabetic list of links to every distinct knot discussed or illustrated on the web. 
* Brion Toss Rigging. The professional site of Brion Toss, the leading authority on ship rigging alive today. (I sell his knotting and rigging books in my book section, below.) Includes a catalog, news, links, and Spar Talk, his wonderful discussion board. 
* The Knotting Dictionary of Kännet. Maintained by Jan Korpegård. Under each knot, Korpegård gives the knot's name in 10 languages, and asks readers of other languages to send him the names of the same knots in their languages; he even provides the form for submitting the names electronically. Also available in Swedish.

Necktie knots. Look how many sites there are on necktie knot compared to (say) climbing or fishing knots. This shows you what men care about these days vanity and conformity even at the price of discomfort. Men of the world, awaken! This is the age of the internet. If your boss makes you wear a tie, leave your boss. Start your own company. Telecommute. Tie the knots you want to tie and no others.

* You've probably heard about Yong Mao and Thomas Fink, the two physicists from Cambridge's prestigious Cavendish Laboratory who turned from physics, even from respectable knot theory, to necktie theory. Because they published their mathematical analysis of necktie knots in the equally prestigious journal Nature (vol. 398, pp. 31-32, March 4, 1999), their new knots have become the biggest knot story in the mainstream press since the supposed discovery of the Hunter's Bend in 1978. But while the Hunter's Bend is a useful knot, this is just a pain in the neck. Here are some details.

Knot Software 	

Some of these programs are also listed in my sections on knot tying, knot theory, and knot art.

Knot Videos Sub-Sections
Videos on knot tying | Videos on knot theory | Videos on knot art 	

When I started this guide, I disregarded web pages advertising knotting videotapes, because I linked only to knotting content, not to ads for knotting content. I've slowly and selectively changed this policy over the years, and have now (9/2000) begun to collect links to knotting videos. I wish I had URLs for all the video sites I once visited and ignored. I hope to bring this section up to date over the next few revisions of the page. If you know of videos I've overlooked, please drop me a line. 

If a knotting video doesn't have its own web site, but is for sale from Amazon.com, then I have not made its title into a link. For these videos, I only know what Amazon.com has dislosed in its video catalogue.

* KnotsCD. Instructions for 64 knots. Available on a CD or as a huge downloadable MPG. I can't tell whether the MPG is all or part of the CD and I'm not going to download the file and buy the CD in order to find out. 
* Knots Made Easy. A 94 minute video on decorative knotting. From Richard Phelan. The web site contains a nice history of fancy knotting. Although priced in pounds, knotters outside England will apparently pay in their own local currency if they order by credit card.

Here are some of my favorite knotting books and an easy method to buy them at a discount. This service is offered in association with Amazon.com. 

If you buy a book through the link on my page, Amazon.com will pay me a referral fee. I donate all my referral fees to the Caroline Robinson Beasley Fund at Earlham College, to help needy students buy textbooks. 

With a few exceptions, I've listed books alphabetically by author's surname within each category. Because retail prices and the Amazon.com discounts are subject to change, I no longer list them. For prices, click through on a title of interest. 

Here in the book section, the flag means that a book is new to my page, not that it is newly published. 

Books on Knot Tying

* The Alternative Knot Book, by Harry Asher, Sheridan House, 1989. Instead of simply giving instructions on the basic knots, Asher offers a theory of knot classification based on the similarities of knots to one another, and teaches the knots in their natural order. Paperback. 
* The only other book of this kind that I know is, unfortunately, not available from Amazon.com. It is A Fresh Approach to Knotting and Ropework: Knots Arranged According to Their Structure, by Charles Warner, published by Charles Warner (Picton, Australia), 1992. Of the two, Asher's is shorter and simpler; Warner's more extensive and sophisticated. Paperback. 

* The Ashley Book of Knots, by Clifford W. Ashley, Doubleday, 1944 (reissued 1993). If you are interested in practical knots and knot tying, this is the one book to own. Ashley collected knots from every occupation, illustrated them by hand, and described them in his concise and salty prose. His collection of 3,900 knots and 7,000 illustrations is unrivaled for scope and utility, even today. All knotting literature refers to it. Unusual knots without names are typically cited by their Ashley number. To make a prima facie case that a knot is a new creation, one need only show that it does not appear in Ashley. It makes a great read for the knotting lore interspersed among the technical instructions and the window it provides onto many fascinating past forms of manual labor. Because the knots for (say) square-rigged sailing ships, stevedores, steeplejacks, and draymen have been made obsolete by modern tecchnologies, the book is of immense historical value, even if these knots were not transferable to other applications. Ashley has his weaknesses, but these quickly become part of the charm of the book. For example, are some of his instructions confusing, or is he simply overestimating our intelligence and experience? Hardback only. 
* My views are clear. If you can only buy one knotting book, buy Ashley's. There are a hundred knotting primers and collections shorter and less interesting than Ashley's. Most of them are not worth buying if you already own Ashley. But the best of them, while less comprehensive than Ashley, have their own advantages which make them useful even alongside Ashley. In this select company, I would put Bigon and Regazzoni (1982), Budworth (1997), Budworth (1999), Fry (1996), Pawson (1998), Toss (1990), and Toss (1998), all of which are listed below. 

* The Art of Rigging, by George Biddlecombe, Dover Publications, 1990 (original 1925). If you think you know knots but can't tell your keckling from your kevels, your jiggers from your jib-guys, your gammoning from your gripes, or your catheads from your catherpins, then you need this book. It's the first I've seen that doesn't presuppose that you already know. Paperback. 
* The Morrow Guide to Knots, by Mario Bigon and Guido Regazzoni, translated by Maria Piotrowska, William Morrow & Co., 1982 (Italian original 1981). A first-rate book, one of the best for the 70 knots it covers. Unusually clear illustrations, using color photographs of colored cord. Contains some rare and useful knots hard to find elsewhere, such as a bowline when the standing part is under tension (pp. 80-81) and the self-locking Poldo tackle (p. 118). One of the best collections after Ashley. Paperback. 
* The Knot Book, by Geoffrey Budworth, Sterling Publishers, 1985. More comprehensive than most of the general collections of useful knots, with exceptionally clear descriptions and illustrations, by one of the greatest living experts on knotcraft. But for even better books by the same author, see the next two titles. Paperback. 
* The Complete Book of Knots, by Geoffrey Budworth, Lyons & Burford, 1997. This is an elegant and useful book. The word "Complete" in the title is the only false note. It covers all the well-known knots and an unusually large number of lesser-known knots, new knots, and knot tricks. (He is the only major knot compiler who acknowledges that new knots are still being discovered.) The instructions and illustrations are very clear. Budworth includes a brief historical note on each knot, and a useful table on the best knots for different spheres sailing, fishing, climbing, and so on. One of the best collections after Ashley. Paperback. 
* The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots and Ropework by Geoffrey Budworth, Lorenz Books, 1999. How do you top the misnamed Complete Book of Knots? With the misnamed Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots. This book is the first lush, coffee-table book of knots ever published. It's not as comprehensive as it appears, with 256 pages (to Ashley's 620) and roughly one knot per page (to Ashley's 5-7). The large, color photographs are more beautiful (for knot fanciers) than instructive. The knots are well-chosen from all fields and are marked with icons for their common applications. A worthy collection, but Budworth is starting to repeat himself. Hardback. 
* The Forensic Analysis of Knots and Ligatures, by Robert Chisnall, Lightning Powder Co., 2000. If you're reading this page, then you're probably among the top knotting experts in your town. Hence, you may eventually be asked by police to help analyze knots and ligatures left at crime scenes to learn what they reveal about the person who tied them. Chisnall's book is the best ever written on the subject and the only one still in print. Knotting experise is not enough to do well in this field. You need Chisnall's many years of experience dealing with murder, suicide, and accident, working with police, preserving evidence, and testifying in court. Hardback. 
* Climbing knots. Also see the rope rescue books. 
* Climbing is too dangerous for you to rely on your knotting common sense. Many classic knots that work beautifully in fiber rope, with its high friction, slip in modern synthetic climbing rope. Some useful climbing knots, like the Munter Hitch and Klemheist, simply aren't known in other domains like sailing or fishing. Carabiners make some knots unnecessary and at the same time give rise to the need for creative new knots. Finally, climbers often tie in with flat nylon webbing, which raises new knotting challenges not always covered by the knots evolved for leather straps. These are the main reasons why climbing-specific knot books are useful. 
* Knots for Climbers, by Craig Luebben, Chockstone Press, 1995. Short, clear, and well-illustrated. Paperback. 
* Climbing Knots For Lefties and Righties, by John McMullen, ICS Books, 1997. Not only one of the most thorough and best-illustrated of climbing knot books, but the only knot book of any kind I've seen that gives more than a passing nod to left- and right-handed versions of practical knots. Paperback. 
* Knots and Ropes for Climbers, by Duane Raleigh, Stackpole Books, 1998. Roughly as thorough as Luebben, less thorough than McMullen. Has longer prose commentaries on each knot than either of the other books. Clear illustrations. Paperback. 

* The Art of Knotting and Splicing, by Cyrus L. Day, Naval Institute Press, 4th ed., 1987 (first edition, 1947). A jumbo knotting guide illustrated with black and white photographs, brought up to date (especially for synthetic cord) by Ray O. Beard, Jr. and M. Lee Hoffman, Jr. Large enough to contain tips and tricks the ordinary primers and manuals cannot include. Paperback. 
* Knots and Splices, by Cyrus L. Day, International Marine, 1953. A thin, short classic. Combines a good selection of knots with black and white photographs. The photographs are not as clear as those in contemporary books, but are clear enough. Still worth buying if you need to fit your knotting manual into your pocket. Paperback. 
* The Complete Book of Knots and Ropework, by Eric C. Fry, David and Charles, 1996. Another good book by a knotter who knows better than to use the word "Complete" in the title (see Budworth 1997 above). Ninety-five knots well-illustrated with black-and-white photographs. Unlike other general knot manuals, this one gives half its space (as opposed to a quarter or less) to decorative knots. This book reprints Fry's Knots and Ropework and Practical and Decorative Ropework in a single volume. Paperback. 
* The Complete Guide To Knots and How To Tie Them, by Walter F. Gibson, Lifetime Books, 1997 (original 1961). Gibson is yet another knowledgeable knottist who doesn't know what "complete" means. More inclusive than the run-of-the-mill collections I omit from my book list, but not as thorough or well-illustrated as most that I do list. About a third of the book is devoted to magic tricks. 
* Stage Rigging Handbook, by Jay O. Glerum, Southern Illinois University Press, second ed., 1997 (original, 1987). Detailed instruction in all the knots, ropework, and hardware needed to rig a theatrical stage, plus the mathematics for calculating loads and forces. The definitive handbook for this field. Paperback. 
* KnotCraft: The Practical and Entertaining Art of Tying Knots, by Allan and Paulette Macfarlan, Dover Publications, 1967 (original 1967). What sets this book apart from other short collections of useful knots is the well-researched introductory chapter on the history of knotting, many illustrated applications for different knots (as opposed to the knots themselves), and sections on knot games and magic. Paperback. 
* The Handbook of Knots, by Des Pawson, DK Publishing, Inc., 1998. An excellent handbook by one of the co-founders of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. A very wide selection of knots, very well-illustrated with color photographs of colored cord. Each knot is described and photographed in several steps. One of the best knot collections after Ashley. Bound in stiff, flexible covers to withstand wear and tear. (For a while my link took you to the wrong book in Amazon.com. I've fixed it. My apologies to Des Pawson and those who wanted to buy his book.) 
* Rope magic 
* If you are reading this, then you probably carry a hank of cord in your pocket wherever you go. If you do, you might as well know a few tricks. But even if you don't like to astound your friends, there are some nice tricks in these books that have helped me in my (pathetically unsuccessful) assault on the world knot tying speed record. 
* Fun With String, by Joseph Leeming, Dover Publications, 1974 (original 1940). Most of the "fun" is rope magic, but some is ordinary knotting and knot crafts. Paperback. 
* Self-Working Rope Magic, by Karl Fulves, Dover Publications, 1990. More illustrations per trick than other magic books. Paperback. 
* Abbott's Encyclopedia of Rope Tricks for Magicians, by Stewart James, Dover Publications, 1975 (original 1945). Named "Abbott's" after the original publisher. At 400 pages, this is the most thorough collection of rope tricks I've seen. Paperback. 
* Magic with Rope, Robbon, & String, by Bill Severn, Stackpole Books, 1982. Clear and well-illustrated. Paperback. 
* Some of the other books I list in the Knot Tying section (notably, Ashley, Gibson, and the Macfarlans) also contain a good selection of knot tricks. 
* By the way, the single best knot trick I've ever found is at pp. 98-99 of Louis Kauffman's On Knots, a mathematical treatise listed below with the books on knot theory. I'm sure you've seen the trick in which someone ties an overhand knot by crossing their arms before picking up the cord, and then uncrossing them. Kauffman shows you how to do the same trick without crossing your arms first. The version of this trick in Ashley #2576 and Budworth 1977 [p. 151] is not nearly as good. 

* Rope rescue. Also see the climbing knot books. 
* Books on rope rescue contain ordinary knots, climbing knots, some knots rarely used elsewhere, and comprehensive coverage of harnesses, anchors, and rigging for rescues under many different circumstances. Unlike most knot books, which simply show the tying steps for a selection of knots out of context, these books show the knots and rigging procedures in action, with tips on safety, alternatives, and when to apply what. As in climbing, this is an area where the stakes are high and learning from the experience of others can make the difference between life and death. 
* Engineering Practical Rope Rescue Systems, by Michael G. Brown, Delmar, 2000. A large book (322 oversized pages) on the full-scope of rope rescue, emphasizing the practical. It avoids asserting that there is just one way to rig a given rescue, and shows the safety and speed issues which would help you choose among alternatives. It is one of the few books willing to disclose mistakes in earlier books, and to go beyond the basics on some technical subjects, e.g. the metallurgy of rescue hardware, legal and professional regulations, and highlines. Illustrated with black-and-white drawings and photographs. Paperback. 
* CMC Rope Rescue, edited by James A. Frank, CMC Rescue Inc., 1998. A large book (208 oversized pages) on rope rescue in nearly all settings. This makes it more general than the specialized works below, which is a plus if you want orientation or flexibility, a minus if you work in a special field of rope rescue. Black-and-white drawings. Paperback. 
* Swiftwater Rescue:  A Manual for the Rescue Professional, by Slim Ray, CFS Press, 1997. A large book (243 oversized papges) covering its special topic, rescue from whitewater rivers and floods, in great detail. Many black-and-white drawings and a few photographs. Paperback. 
* Confined Space and Structural Rope Rescue, by Michael Roop, Thomas Vines, and Richard Wright, Mosby-Year Book, 1998. Color drawings and photographs illustrate this large book (384 oversized pages), focused on rescues from confined spaces and other difficult locations. Paperback. 
* On Rope:  North American Vertical Rope Techniques, by Bruce Smith and Allen Padgett, National Speleological Society, new edition, 1996. A large book (382 oversized pages) on rope techniques for vertical ascents and descents, for example in "caving, search and rescue, firefighting, rope rescue, mountaineering, window cleaning, river runners, rock climbing, aborists, event riggers, military operations, challenge courses, nautical applications, and rappellers" to quote the title page. Numerous black-and-white drawings and a few photos. Very detailed text. (The "new edition" of 1996 and the "second edition" of 1997 are apparently the same; at least they have the same ISBN.) Hardback only. 

* Nautical Knots and Lines Illustrated, by Paul and Arthur Snyder, International Marine, 1997. A short book with some material not covered in longer books on the standard knots. Clear black and white photographs, several per knot to show successive stages. Paperback. 
* Knowing the Ropes:  A Sailor's Guide to Selecting, Rigging, and Handling Lines Aboard, by Roger C. Taylor, International Marine, second edition, 1993. Goes well beyond the basic boating knots. Covers essentially all the applications for rope on shipboard, with abundant detail on technique, efficiency, and safety. Clear black and white drawings. Paperback. 
* Chapman's Nautical Guides: Knots, by Brion Toss, Hearst Marine Books, 1990. A remarkably clear and useful handbook of boating knots, more comprehensive than other knotting books limited to one domain (more than 100 knots covered). Bound in flexible covers to stand up to the wear of a working life. Lucid illustrations by Gae Pilon. One of the best collections after Ashley. For Toss's magnum opus, see the next entry. 
* The Complete Rigger's Apprentice, by Brion Toss, International Marine, 1998. Toss's Rigger's Apprentice and Rigger's Locker reprinted (and synthesized) in a single volume. Toss is the only contemporary writer who can compare to Clifford Ashley and Hervey Garrett Smith in technical knowledge, literary skill, and nautical authenticity. These very recent books are already classics. Loaded with knowledge and lore one fears is slipping away, even if elegantly preserved in books like this one. Illustrated with wit by Robert Shetterly. One of the few must-have books after Ashley. Hardback only. 

Books on Knot Theory

* The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots, by Colin C. Adams, W.H. Freeman and Co., 1994. One of the two best introductions to mathematical knot theory (with Livingston, below). Introduces all the basic terms and concepts, with well-designed exercises. Also includes open questions to challenge advanced readers. Hardback only. 
* Knots and Surfaces, by N.D. Gilbert and T. Porter, Oxford University Press, 1997 (original 1994). An introduction to knot theory and the topology of surfaces, showing their connections to one another and to such related fields as graph theory and group theory. Clearly written and illustrated. Presupposes no knot theory and only undergraduate mathematics. Paperback. 
* On Knots, by Louis H. Kauffman, Princeton University Press, 1987. A serious treatise that I recommended above for a great knotting magic trick at pp. 98-99. Not an introduction to knot theory, except for the mathematically able. If you've read one of the good introductions (by Adams or Livingston, for example) and want more, this is a good book to try. Wonderfully apt and playful illustrations. Hardback only. 
* Knot Theory, by Charles Livingston, Mathematical Association of America, 1993. One of the two best general introductions to mathematical knot theory (with Adams, above). Illuminates the field from the perspectives of geometry, combinatorics, and algebra. Hardback only. 
* Symmetric Bends: How to Join Two Lengths of Cord, by Roger E. Miles, World Scientific Publishing Co., 1995. A fascinating mix of mathematics and practical knot-tying. Miles gives the mathematics of the symmetric bends (like the Hunter's bend and the Zeppelin bend), sixty variations on the theme, and instructions for inventing new ones. Hardback only. 
* Knots and Links, by Dale Rolfsen, Publish or Perish, Inc., 1976. One of the classic textbooks in the field. Clear and thorough, but (like Kauffman) not an introduction except for those with a mathematical background. Especially helpful is the appendix (by James Bailey and Ali Roth) on prime knots and links. Paperback. 
* Knots, by Alexei Sossinsky. The most readable introduction I've seen. What it lacks in thoroughness, it provides in clarity. Very readable introductions to a miscellany of knot theory topics from the elementary to the somewhat advanced. If it were more thorough or systematic, I'd rank it among the best introductions to the field. Hardback. 
* History and Science of Knots, edited by J. C. Turner and P. Van De Griend, World Scientific Publishing Co., 1996. This is the most gratifying book on knots to be published in a long time. It proves that knotting by prehistoric peoples can be studied. It proves that knotting can be regarded as one of the earliest and most widespread technologies on which civilization depends. It's expensive ($78) and only available in hardback. But if you always knew that there was more to the study of knots than either the knot-tying manuals or the mathematical treatises let on, but didn't know where to put your hands on it, here it is. Hardback only. 

Books on Knot Art

* Celtic Knotwork, by Iain Bain, Sterling Pub. Co., 1992. A step-by-step guide for beginners, emphasizing the construction of grids to fit the shape in which you'll be working. Lovely drawn illustrations of the techniques, photographs of historical specimens. Becomes quite advanced by the end. Paperback. 
* The Complete Book of Decorative Knots, by Geoffrey Budworth, The Lyons Press, 1998. A thorough guide to decorative knots with sections on lanyard knots, button and globe knots, Turk's heads, mats and hitching, and plaits and braids. (Thorough does not mean "complete", as Budworth and his publisher should know.) Clear drawings, usually many per knot. In addition to instructions, each knot is accompanied by a few words on its applications and history. Paperback. 
* Chinese Knotting, by Lydia Chen, Echo Books, n.d. An ancient and beautiful art, almost destroyed by the Cultural Revolution. Lydia Chen has done more than anyone else to preserve and revive it. Stunning color photographs of classical and contemporary examples, many of the best by the author herself. Distinctively Chinese and quite different from Western decorative knotting. This is the book that persuaded me that "decorative knotting" is a true art, not mere decoration. Hardback only. 
* If you like Chen's book, you will also like Hanamusubi: Traditional Japanese Flower-Knots by Toshiko Tanaka, Kyoto Shoin Co., Ltd., 1993. Paperback. Unfortunately, Tanaka's book is not available from Amazon.com. 

* Encyclopedia of Knots and Fancy Rope Work, by Raoul Graumont and John Hensel, Cornell Maritime Press, 4th ed., 1952. Over 700 pages of knot descriptions and photographs. There are better books for practical knots, but for decorative knots it is unrivaled in its scope and detail. Hardback only. 
* The Book of Ornamental Knots, by John J. Hensel, Cornell Maritime Press, 1990 (Original, 1973). Hensel is the co-author of the Encyclopedia of Knots and Fancy Rope Work (above). While the larger work is more like a museum, this one is much more a primer. A good introduction to large knotting projects (belts, mats, wall hangings) by one of the masters. Illustrated with black and white photographs. Paperback. 
* Celtic Design:  Knotwork:  The Secret Method of the Scribes, by Aidan Meehan, Thames and Hudson, 1991. A step-by-step guide for beginners. Elegant illustrations and calligraphy by the author. Builds up to some complex designs. Paperback. 
* The Book of Decorative Knots, by Peter Owen, Lyons & Burford, 1994. This is the best introductory book I've seen on decorative knots. It's not encyclopedic, it's not intimidating, and it presupposes no knotting sophistication. Short with clear black and white line drawings and concise descriptions. (Having said that, it wouldn't take much practice for the beginner to outgrow this book.) Paperback. 
* How to Draw Celtic Knotwork, by Andy Sloss, Blandford Books, 1995. Unlike the other Celtic knotting books listed here (by Bain, Meehan, and Sturrock), Sloss breaks Celtic knotting designs down into the distinct lines and square modules which may be combined to make complex designs. Because each line and module can be named, he produces a notation for arbitrary patterns. The modules are illusrated for hand-drawing and computer graphics. Paperback. 
* The Arts of the Sailor, by Hervey Garrett Smith, Dover Publications, 1990 (original 1953). This book is about half and half practical knots and sailors' knot art. I've arbitrarily decided to list it with the art books. Smith is like Ashley in that he draws his own, very clear illustrations, and writes with the authentic saltiness of an old sailor. This is one of the few knot books that is as enjoyable to read as it is to use. Smith wrote a subsequent book, The Marlinspike Sailor (International Marine, 1993, original 1960) that covers much the same ground as Arts of the Sailor, but with a slightly greater tilt toward artful knotting. It also has a useful appendix on splicing woven, synthetic cord. Both are paperbacks. 
* Celtic Knotwork Designs, by Sheila Sturrock, Guild of Master Craftsman Publications, Ltd., 1997. A step-by-step guide for beginners. Handsome illustrations. Paperback. 

Amazon.com also pays me a referral fee for the books and other products you buy as a result of searching its catalog with the following search box. The products need not pertain to knots at all. I donate all my referral fees to the Caroline Robinson Beasley Fund at Earlham College to help needy students buy textbooks.
