Subject : L7) What is the largest known outbreak of TC tornadoes? 
Contributed by Bill McCaul and John Guiney
Hurricane Beulah spawned a reported 115 tornadoes in southeast Texas during the first several days after its landfall in September 1967 (Orton 1970). This number of tornadoes represents one of the largest tornado outbreaks of any kind in the U. S. tornado climatology. (However, the actual number of tornadoes that occured with Beulah has been questioned, as the National Hurricane Center preliminary report indicated 95 tornadoes while the Monthly Weather Review annual hurricane summary article reported 47). In 1992, Hurricane Andrew spawned 49 tornadoes during and after its second landfall in Louisiana. It is difficult to predict which TCs will produce large tornado outbreaks, although there is some indication that the likelihood of a major outbreak increases as TC size and intensity increase.
