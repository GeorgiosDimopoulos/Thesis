Today I am mostly feeling itchy  
I have today been informed third hand by the female versions of Statler and Waldorf that work in the admin office, that S&G (the directors) 10 yr old boy has head lice.To a 10 yr old boy, head lice is as natural as being amused at fart jokes and suchlike, but to a 30-something with long hair, this is the horror to end all horrors. The concept of having my hair (which would be a veritable theme-park) crawling with bloodsucking parasitic organisms fills me with dread.I've spent the day itching.... I'm hoping it's psychosomatic !! I'm scared !!

Grudging Apology  
Apologies to one and all for not posting in the last couple of weeks. I have not been on away, been on my death bed or suffered some dire emergency. My reasons for not writing anything are down to blatant indolence on my part. Quite frankly I could not be arsed.I am however off on holiday this Sunday, for 10 nights in Malta. Not quite as exotic as trips to Australia *wink*, but nevertheless the "royal we", namely my wife and I, are returning to our honeymoon hotel for our "almost" wedding anniversary. (http://www.hiltonmalta.com.mt/). Other than that, I have no news. The trains are still rubbish, "company in the middle of nowhere" is still the same, and frankly I have nothing to whine about at the moment. As my school reports used to say.............must try harder

Today, I will be mostly doin' impressions of Lee Marvin singing "Wanderin' Star". My voice has dropped at least 2 octaves and my throat is all red and pustulent - nice. All my wife did was laugh at my misfortune - grrr.Needless to say I am at home feeling sorry for myself. I've even lost the will to type......

Poorly Sick !!  
My throat is still sore this morning. I feel like I have been swallowing hedgehogs all night. When I talk I sound like Chris Rea and Im not amused in the slightest.Today is a big meeting. I finally get to meet the other Training Facilitators and ultimately C, who I will be shadowing for the next few weeks/months until I attain my A1 assessors qualification. Surprisingly I am quite nervous – don’t ask me why, because I’m not the shy and retiring sort. Perhaps people will take pity on me because Im poorly-sick. By the end of the day I’m going to sound like Stephen Hawking – I just know it.This morning’s 8.05 to Edinburgh was actually on time, and I found a seat straight away. Additionally the only sound that can be heard is the rustling of broadsheets and the gentle snoring of a female passenger behind me. I am completely at a loss for anything to complain about !! HOWEVER…..there is a girl down the aisle with white eyeshadow and scarlet lipstick that makes her look like Coco the Clown. I hav e to find SOMETHING to criticise !!Saying that, my wife and I were having a conversation this morning about whether I should wear my tie with monkeys or tortoises on it. Before anyone comments I have never ONCE admitted I have any taste *grin*.Oh well, will soon be at destination for a 6 mile taxi ride into “village in the middle of nowhere”. I must take pictures with my camera that sometimes doubles as a phone and post them here.

Lay off the jam tarts !!  
I’m feeling incredibly sorry for myself at the moment. I have a sore throat. I can’t cope with being ill. I like my body to work perfectly with little or no deviation from the norm. However the nagging scraping when I swallow has mutated into a feeling like someone is trying to ram a cactus down my throat. I hate it.I probably caught it from this commuting. I’m going to get onto one of those “Ambulance Chasing” insurance companies tomorrow morning to see if I can make a claim against the train company for becoming ill.This evening’s annoying distraction is a Down’s Syndrome chap who is stuffing jam tarts into his mouth at an alarming rate. I can see him being SO ill later. I hope his carer realises this. (Actually she probably does but doesn’t care….. her shift will probably over soon and his pukeage will be someone elses problem). He’s very loud too – even drowning out the dulcet tones of Ronnie James Dio singing “Die Young”. (Black Sabbath for those not in the know) I remember taking a party of 12 Down’s Syndrome adults for their Xmas lunch when I was at college, volunteering at the Special Needs unit. After 2 pints each, they become worse than any stag night I have ever been to / witnessed. Down’s adults have a tendency to be very clingy at the best of times, when they’re drunk it’s much worse. Having a grown man in his 30s hanging off the back of you, wanting to hold your hand because “he loves you and you’re his best friend” is quite a strange experience. Fun times……I’m also annoyed in a purely selfish way that the wonderful Office B!tch is going away on holiday before I am. Not that I begrudge ANYONE a holiday, but the fact I will have a distinct lack of witty and intelligent material to read in my brief “down-times” in the office, especially as Belle de Jour has stopped writing too. (Not that I am making a comparison between the two of you Cherry !! - *looks scared*) Have a good holiday…. I mean it.Well the train has stopped at a station and lots of people have got on. My writing can now be read by at least 6 people. I am no longer anonymous, so I will call it a day. Day 16 without a fag – still need one though….. 8(

Cue Julie Andrews  
I have received a few emails in the last couple of days insinuating, nay accusing, me of being a miserable curmudgeonly individual who derives absolutely no pleasure from my life whatsoever.In answer to my critics in a big “may the fleas of a thousand camels infest your groin” kind of way, cue Julie Andrews….I am a sucker for a good spaghetti carbonara. There is a restaurant near to where I live that makes aforementioned dish with smoked chicken, bacon, ham and grilled cheese on top. Very yummy in an artery clogging way.Women whose smile lights up their whole face. I don’t mean the cheesy, coat-hanger in mouth, showing lots of teeth smile – but there is something wonderful about that nose-crinkling, slightly naughty expression that some women possess when they smile. It’s difficult to put into words – but I know what I mean and that’s all that counts ! Telemann. Baroque composer – wrote an obscene number of sonata’s for wind instruments. There is something about several of his works that bring me out in goosebumps. Listen to his Recorder Sonatas in A minor and you will see what I mean. Not as ornate and “flowery” as Bach or as commonly listened to as Vivaldi, but very prolific and varied in his worksThe way my wife smells in the morning as she is waking up. Bleary eyed, sleepy and incoherent with messy sticky-up hair. She smells of warmth and of sleep – and in my humble opinion is the most gorgeous woman on the planet. (However I don’t think she’d agree with that statement *grin* )Kittens. Yes, you read that right. Kittens – as in small fluffy grey/blue eyed mewling creatures. I confess to turning into a complete girl when Im around the things. I am a cat person (having had a rescue cat and being used to having them around when I was growing up). Cats are intelligent, self-assured and highly independent. I like that in an animal. Cats (unlike dogs) don’t follow you about like they’re stuck to your shadow and don’t feel the necessity to sniff your groin every few minutes. Bah, I could go on about the evils of canines for hours but I won. No – I’m a cat person.So there you go, that’s FIVE things I derive pleasure from. I think the line is “What I do love, I love passionately”. You’re not getting any more – so there !! I will continue to be sarcastic, cynical and generally miserable for as long as I write this blog. It’s fun and slightly cathartic. Without it I would probably become like Michael Douglas’ character in “Falling Down”.In the words of the great man…….. “I am standing up for my rights as a consumer”

Bored, bored, bored  
It’s only Monday and I’m fed up with commuting to “the middle of nowhere” already. I have another 4 days of 2 hr each way “train hell”. I really am losing the will to live. Next week I will hopefully be let loose into the big wide world to shadow another trainer… or at least do what I was employed to do. I don’t want to be IT-monkey anymore.At least I have a seat on the train tonight. I am eavesdropping on a strange conversation from the two women opposite me whose sole topic of conversation is which skirt / pair of shoes to wear to some undoubtedly boring meeting. It’s just completely surreal. Why do women have to plan stuff in this way? You never hear two guys saying "Oh I think I i'll wear that light blue shirt and my stripey tie on Thurdsay". It’s one of life’s mysteries like “Why do women go to the toilet in pairs?” I’m convinced I will never work this out. The more I try, the more my head hurts. I’m glad I’m not a woman though, having to make such complex decisions on a daily basis (and so far in advance) would undoubtedly drive me mad.I need to go on holiday. Only 27 more days until my wife and I can escape to Malta. We’re going to the same hotel we went to for our honeymoon. I can’t wait. I haven’t had a cigarette now for 15 days. I’m quite proud of myself. Perhaps I might not die of a horrid artery clogging disease after all. I still feel like I need a fag though……….. one day at a time.

Don't mention the laundry !!  
Oh happy joy ! This morning’s train is full at the first stop, causing me to sit cross legged and seething like some malevolent Bhudda in the aisle downwind of a particularly unpleasant toilet. Oh what it is to be back to the normality of my torment at the hands of the train bods after my fantastic weekend.Sunday was my birthday. My wife had really gone out of her way to make it special, and had booked a table at my favourite Chinese restaurant for lunch. Surprisingly we were not hacked to pieces with cleavers when we entered, as the last time we went my mother-in-law (73) had spent nearly the whole meal praising the laundry skills of the whole Chinese race in tones the whole restaurant could hear.I would say that she doesn’t mean it (it’s her generation etc etc), but she does have to be one of the most racist, homophobic people I know. Her gay neighbours (affectionately known as “the boys”) with their gay cats Crystal and Carrington are always a popular topic at Sunday lunchtime. She’s not nasty, just TOTALLY un-PC, and incredibly funny in an embarrassing way. However I digress…..The meal was lovely and one of the rare opportunities my wife and I actually get to talk. Not just the idle chit-chat of everyday life but a proper adult conversation that seems quite rare these days with out busy lives. We really do need to get out more.and spend more “quality time” together.The other good thing about birthdays are the presents. Not just RECEIVING presents you understand, but receiving something that you are genuinely surprised and delighted by. Among the many bits and pieces I was given as gifts, my wife had actually bought me the Star Wars Trilogy on DVD. I wasn’t expecting it, I hadn’t got round to buying it, and she knows it’s my favourite film. (in fact the first film I ever saw at the cinema). It was such a surprise as I know she (a) hates sci-fi films and (b) hates trawling around music/DVD shops. Needless to say I was a very happy bunny…….. there again, I’m easily pleased.Stranger gifts included a Womans Weekly cookery book given to me by one of my friends (I will explain the reason for that gift another time !!) and a plastic egg thingy with silly interchangeable faces (given to my by my friend’s 2 yr old daughter).All in all it was a good day….. however I am getting close to my destination. Another fun packed week at “Company in the middle of nowhere awaits”

Ugg boots, fishnet and knickers  
Fortunately for me, being a guy leaves me with limited fashion choices – probably the most complicated of which is to choose which tie to wear with which shirt, or in fact which shirt to wear. With the vast choice for women, it’s understandable how fashion faux pas can occur. However, looking around me on this morning’s 08.05 to Edinburgh, I feel I am in some kind of fashion hell.Firstly “Ugg boots” (A phrase coined by the wonderful Office B!tch). These are the most disgusting things imaginable. A cross between the ski-boot things of the 80’s and old people’s sheepskin slippers. Usually worn by woman with exceedingly short skirts and Croydon facelift (a la hair pulled back so tight, the wearer’s facial features are moved to the back of the head). Why are so many women wearing them… they are horrid. Is there an “Ugg boot” convention today?Fishnet. Fishnet has its place (Im not leering – I promise !), but surely a beautifully tailored grey business suit and white fishnet tights/stockings do not go well together? Someone enlighten me please. The “Business Hooker” look is not attractive – trust me. And how DO women walk in heels that high ? (Enquiring minds – namely mine – wish to know)Knickers. Is it REALLY necessary for a woman to rummage about in her bag for her makeup etc, only to pull out a (spare? / last nights ?) pair of knickers, placing them on the table no more than 6 ft from me? There is such a thing as discretion you know – especially when they are neon pink and look like one of my grannies doilies with leg holes !!That brings me onto another matter. Women and make-up…… or specifically women who feel it necessary to do the whole make-up thing on the train. I’m not talking about re-applying a little bit of lipstick here, but total facial reconstruction. I’m unfortunately aware of “knickers lady” laying out enough products to compete with any of the major cosmetics producers. Luckily Im not going to be on the train long enough to witness this wonder of facial rendering. Im getting a rather disturbing picture of her last nights activities. Perhaps it’s time to leave this train for my own sanity.
