Phys. J. A2 (1998) 17 and in combination with fast chemical separations applying the SISAK technique at the Mainz TRIGA reactor Eur. Phys. J. A1 (1998) 285 ) and on the other side, highly selective Laser ion sources allow to study nuclei with extremely low production yields in the presence of extremely high contaminations (ISOLDE, recent results on heavy Mn isotopes in Phys. Rev. Lett. 82 (1999) 1391 ). At LISOL, the combination of both techniques has yielded promising first results on neutron-rich nickel and cobalt isotopes ( Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 3100 ). For the nuclides with very low production yields, often only "gross" properties as half-lives and the delayed-neutron emission probability P n can be obtained (i.e. Ann. Rep. 1995, p. 22 ; Ann. Rep. 1998, p. 24 ; tables of measured and predicted T 1/2 and P n -values can be downloaded in PDF ). Recently, in collaboration with the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, existing experimental data for fission products were re-evaluated and compared to theoretical predictions: B. Pfeiffer, K.-L. Kratz, and P. Möller Status of Delayed-Neutron Precursor Data: Half-Lives and Neutron Emission Probabilities ; Report: LA-UR-00-5897 and Progr. Nucl. Energ. 41/1-4 (2002) 39-69 . More sophisticated spectroscopy is possible for higher yields (as g - g -time coincidences to determine level lifetimes; see, i.e. Ann. Rep. 1995, p. 24 ), allowing to construct detailed excitation schemes from which spins, parities, nuclear deformations ( for a visualisation of shapes click here or see P. Möller et al. Nature 409 (2001) 785 ) can be extracted. Then, applying b - g coincidence techniques, Q b -values can be measured and by this the important nuclear masses. Comparing these results to theoretical mass models (a recent publication: At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 66 (1997) 131 ), hints for further improvements are obtained, which are essential for applications in fields as nuclear astrophysics dealing with far unstable nuclides not accessible for measurements with nowadays techniques (On-line access to calculated Nuclear Properties for Astrophysics by P. Möller). Fit to the delayed coincidences between the 140 keV line feeding the isomeric level at 1838 keV and the deexciting transition of 1693 keV (filled red squares).

Partial level scheme of 98 Sr showing the transitions relevant for the discussion of the isomeric level at 1838 keV. For further details, see Ann. Rep. 1995, p. 24 . Further analysis revealed a deformed K=3 band with probable even parity built on the isomer at 1838 keV. It is interpreted as a two-quasi-neutron excitation in accordance with a quantum Monte Carlo pairing calculation in an article in Phys. Rev. C65, 024318 (2002).

Kratz et al., Ap. J. 403, 216(1993) ). Comparing our calculated with observed patterns, we can derive information on astrophysical as well as nuclear structure parameters ( Ann. Rep. 1996 and B.

(As if we were in the footsteps of Ptolemaios (main) work "Apotelesmatika" [better known as "Tetrabiblos&quot], in which he laid the basis of astrology under the assumption, that our lifes are intimately interrelated to the stars.) Very recently, the above mentioned article of W.D. Harkins was brought to our attention, in which the author "shows a relation between the abundance of the elements (in meteorites) and the structure of the nuclei of atoms" already in the year 1917. As an example, the Fig. 1 displayed above shows that "even-numbered elements are more abundant than odd-numbered ones" . That this odd-even effect is valid up to the heaviest elements can be seen in the figure below displaying r-process abundances in an old Halo star. Combined with recent determinations of the abundances of rare earth elements and the cosmochronometer thorium in very old halo stars by optical spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope , decisive contributions to open questions on the Galactic nucleosynthesis and the age of the Galaxy will result ( Ann. Rep. 1996 and Nucl. Phys. A630 (1998) 352c ). Elemental r-abundances calculated with ETFSI-Q masses (red line) [J.M. Pearson et al., Phys. Lett. B387 (1996) 455] are compared to the respective N r,solar values (green filled circles). Superimposed are measured abundances (blue filled squares) from the metal-poor halo star CS22892-052 [C. Sneden et al., Ap. J. 591 (2003) 936], which were normalized to the solar rare-earth values (see J.J. Cowan et al., Ap.J. 521 (1999) 194-205 ). The observation of "solar" neutron-capture element abundance distributions in four metal-poor halo stars indicates to a unique r-process site in the Galaxy (at least for Z > 55). The estimated decay-age of T = (15.6 ± 4) billion years for the thorium in these stars represent a lower limit for the age of the Galaxy and (evidently) the Universe (see, B. Pfeiffer et al. in IX. Workshop on Nuclear Astrophysics and J.J. Cowan et al., Ap.J. 521 (1999) 194-205 ). Recently, new perspectives for radioactive dating of old stars opened with the first simultaneous detection of thorium and uranium in the metal-poor star CS31082-001 by R. Cayrel et al. in Nature 409 (2001) 691 . Combined with the Basel-Mainz initial r-process production values (see J.J. Cowan et al., Ap.J. 521 (1999) 194-205) an age of (12.5±3) Gyr was obtained (for more details see R-Process Cosmo-Chronometers ). (These age determinations are cited in Ned Wright's Frequently Asked Questions in Cosmology: How old is the Universe? .) First calculations on the proposed two r-process components can be found in my contribution to the conference Nuclei in the Cosmos 2000 . Further information on the origin of the elements in our Galaxy may be obtained from the analysis of the composition of Galactic cosmic rays. The ultraheavy cosmic rays (heavier than neodynium with Z=60) appear to come from a pure r-process (explosive) source (see Trek and ECCO-detectors on the space stations Mir and ACCESS in preparation for ISS in 2005, respectively). If confirmed by the next generation of experiments (as the ECCO-detector or advanced versions of TIGER, the Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder as first payload for the Ultra-Long Duration Balloon Project ), all the heavier neutron-capture elements originate in a unique explosive scenario, which remained unchanged over the history of the Galaxy from the onset of r-process nucleosynthesis in the first halo stars until present times (as evidenced by the Galactic cosmic rays with an estimated mean lifetime in the order of 10 million years).

Our group studies nuclear structure of very short-lived exotic isotopes by detecting and analysing the radiation emitted following the decay of these highly unstable nuclei. As the production and separation of these rare species demands quite sophisticated instrumentation, such experiments are performed in close collaboration with collegues at several research facilities as:

OSTIS separator at ILL, Grenoble (until 1987)	 

SISAK Fast Chemistry at the TRIGA-reactor in Mainz	 

ISOLDE On-line Separator at CERN, Geneva
