(a home page dedicate to medical themes maintained by, among others, Dr. Paulo André from MIT; it has a number of categories such as obstetrics, surgery, and pediatrics that you can follow to find out more about the illnesses or procedures; contains links to other sites; an "all you need to know" page that serves as a good reference; in English) 

Investigação em Clínica Geral 

(a work-in-progress page on research related to medical clinics; has a good collection of medical links) 

Reinventar Portugal 

(an on-line discussion forum created in part by the Diário Económico and containing a number of its articles; the posted comments are organized by threads and appear to focus on such issues as education and politics; also links to Portugal.Net) 

Lusa Web 

(focused on the expatriate Portuguese, this homepage contains some history of some immigrant communities as well as links to other homepages of the same topic; sponsored by a couple of California organizations, it has a California feel to it) 

Portuguese Pen Pals by Europunk 

(a way of finding people interested in Portugal; contains quite a collection of people who want to exchange email, mostly in Portugal) 

As Festas do Senhor Santo Cristo, Açores 

(another quality page by Pierre de Sousa Lima, it contains everything you would want to know about these festivities in the Açores) 

Mário Pinto's Home Page 

(a short page about the renowned Portuguese photographer Mário Pinto; contains several of his works) 

Cinemapt.com - Portugal no Cinema 

(a commercial site devoted to film-making, both commercial and amateur, with a focus on Portugal; contains a listing of upcoming film festivals, provider directory, classified ads, and related new; nice page but heavy on multimedia so if you're using a modem, beware...) 

Clube Português de Canicultura 

(a complete page on dogs, dog-breeding, and competing; has information on upcoming contests, listed breeders, and local groups; the most interesting part for me was the list of dogs that are specifically/typically Portuguese--with pictures; in Portuguese and English) 

Origin and History of the Portuguese Water Dog 

(perhaps more than you ever wanted to know about this typically-Portuguese animal; this page is all text and contains a list and descriptions of the ancient origins of the dog, as well as a section on what roles the dog played in Portuguese history; part of a much larger compendium on all dogs) 

Wines from the Bairrada Region 

([turn-on-bias-toward-wine] an excellent page dedicated to the wines of Bairrada, actually, this is a commercial site so you'd expect it, but also includes a picture of Portugal with all of its viticultural areas and an on-line glossary of wine terms; very nice graphics [turn-off-bias-toward-wine]) 

CEHA's Collection of Wine Links 

(this is the most complete collection of links I've seen on wine, certainly from the point of view that it is all-encompassing; includes links to wineries, suppliers, ratings, histories, and Internet newsgroups; obviously, it includes a lot of links to Portuguese sites that one does not typically find elsewhere) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Reference Pages on Portuguese 'Things'...

Portugal Telecom 

(the Portuguese telephone company's look-up pages: you can look up useful numbers as well as person's home numbers; the "useful numbers" pages allows you to drill down, by area, into city halls, military headquarters, local transportation, etc.) 

Lusíadas -- Guia de Buscas Lusófonas 

(a directory of Portuguese sites and a search engine; categories of Web pages include culture, politics, children, music, turism, and so on; you can also add your own page; the text search engine is Sapo) 

Cusco 

(allows search of text from 'any' Portuguese Web page; unfortunately, limits the search to 8 hits; allows you to enter your own URL) 

GUIANet--O Universo Empresarial Português 

(a directory of Portuguese companies and businesses--lists addresses and telephone numbers; can look-up by company name, business, or sector; the page also has a section that lists the latest currency rate for the Escudo by the Banco de Portugal; also available in English) 

MWEB -- Marcas na Web 

(online look-up of Portuguese brands and products--you can 'drill down' from a generic product name down to specific products and then the companies that provide them, with addresses and telephone numbers) 

Priberam Informatica's On-Line Dictionary 

(though it's a commercial site, it offers on-line lookups for words, verb conjugations, and a download of a limited version of their dictionary product; has a pretty good collection of links to other language and dictionary sites) 

Dicionário Oficial e Técnico da Comunidade Europeia: Interface em PORTUGUÊS 

(the official Portuguese front-end to EURODICAUTOM, the official European technical dictionary; you enter a technical word in a European language and ask for its translation in another European language; pretty handy sometimes to have access to this... I only wonder why it hasn't been publicized widely...) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Autarnet's List of Emails

Hey! Have any suggestions for additions? Send email to ideamen@well.com. Also, remember that I have a real job and, on occasion, they actually give me work to do--in short, I am happy to add your links but it may take me a couple of days. Finally, I have not included links to pages I don't think are worth it--I review all these sites before I put them here and ONLY include them if they have something to add to the Portuguese world. P.S.: aproveito para dizer que falo Portugu&etilde;s e que podem enviar-me mensagens nesta minha primeira lingua...
