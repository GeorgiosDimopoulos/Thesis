Hajimemashite! 
My name is Helena Heung-Wah Yan. I was born in Hong Kong in 1972, but my family moved to San Francisco in 1984. I have lived in the Bay Area since. 
I graduated from Stanford University in 1994 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and I joined Oracle Corporation immediately afterwards. I was working in the Power Products Division for 2 1/2 years, then I transferred to Front Office Applications. Two years after that, I left Oracle and joined Siebel Systems, Inc. Here is my résumé.

Ever since high school when I read about the establishment of the SCTI (Stanford Center for Technology & Innovation) program, I had wanted to attend Stanford Univerity. Well, turned out I enrolled in the program in 1993, and it was one of the best experiences of my life. The academic quarter in Kyoto was memorable, thanks to my host family. The internship program at NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) was especially worthwhile, since I was finally forced to speak and hear Japanese around the clock. I have also learned to read Japanese technical manuals, which really is not that bad after you get used to seeing katakana. 
One hobby that I developed in Japan was listening to Japanese pop music. My favorite band back then was WANDS, but W (Wesugi Show) and S (Shibasaki Hiroshi) have left the band and formed a new band called al.ni.co. I've also come to like visual rock, thanks to Mark. My favorite bands include LUNA SEA, L'Arc~en~Ciel and MALICE MIZER. Another hobby is watching Japanese TV Drama. I was interested in learning about Japanese encoding methods for a while, so I bought and started reading Ken Lunde's Understanding Japanese Information Processing, no doubt one of the best references. (I never quite finished reading the book though...)
