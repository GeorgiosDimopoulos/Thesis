C'est la vie à Paris!  
What a weekend! At friday morning, 4.30 am, the alarmclock rang me out of bed: The bus to Paris left from Gare du Nord at 6 am! We, thirteen quite tired but excited Erasmus-students, arrived in Paris around 10 am, checked into the hotel and began la voyage fantastique! (Not to talk about that a metro-ticket for three days was 18,25 euros, but hey, it's Paris!) That day we saw tour Eiffel (of course). Unfortunately Paul and me got lost over there already, while the rest of the group went to the very top we looked for them at the first floor and finally gave up searching. We went on by ourselves and saw Hotel des Invalides, Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elyssee, Place de la Concorde, and in the evening, le Louvre, where we found the others again, and Moulin Rouge. Plus 10km walking in metro-tunnels. What a day! The next began with an early wake-up...Again! After a French breakfast we hiked up to Sacre Coeur, one of the most beautiful churches I ever saw in my life. Then the group devided. A female dominated group with Paul as the only "cock in a basket" roamed Montmartre for a while and continued then to Notre Dame, Ile de la Cité and Quartier Latin. Then Paul and me went to Jardin de Luxembourg, Panthéon, la Sorbonne and Hotel de Ville. In the evening everybody met once again in front of tour Eiffel to make a magic touristic cruise on the Seine. Once again in the evening we were too tired to go out at night. The next morning saw another division: One group went to Musée d'Orsay while another, very Spanish group, including me, went to the catacombes only to see them closed till may. Bad luck. Well, we went to Jardin des Plantes and had great crepes, that was nice, too. Luckily everybody arrived in time to catch the bus home. We arrived in Brussels at 11 pm sharp, and tired to the bone. Paris is a fascinating city and very beautiful. Unfortunately we couldn't see Versailles this time, but I am sure I will return there to do that. And one thing is for sure: The metro-tunnels in this city are unbelievably long!Je vous embrasse!Kat.

Busy times  
The weekend is over and so is the pram...One freezing experience! The shuttle-bus brought us to the place - the Brussels Event Brewery - at saturday, 11 o'clock where the party had already started almost an hour ago. There we got welcomed with a free merchandise-drink and a rose for every girl. Charming. Mentionable - next to the really high prices for everything - are the great dj's and the really nice and cozy piano bar. To get from on to the other unfortunately was an Odyssey...You had to cross the street through an unheated, underground tunnel and then walk up to the 1st floor in the other building. The girls in their thin, light dresses hated it. Still it was worth it. The club-room had great light-effects, high sound quality and a varying style of music, so that everybody heard something suitable to his or her taste once in a while. Also noticeable was the snack bar, opening at 12 o'clock. The offer was very Belgian...Something like a mutant of a waffle and a baguette, eaten, how could it be different, with mayonnaise and ketchup. All in all it was really a nice night and really amusing...Even though I missed the classical dance a little. Well, it's still Belgium! :-)Love.Kat.

So now the party took place...Happy Brithday to Chiara and Sebastian!! We had lots of fun, dancing a little bit in the Smouss Bar and later in other locations, too. *g Thank you so much for the great cake (as seen on the pictures, the was A LOT) and the champagne, we surely enjoyed! Also mentionable is the - unfortunately rather short - visit of VUB-students at the party, as always they brought good mood and joy with them. Thank you too! Hugs again.Kat.

So  
HEEEEELLLLOOOO again!So today we were at the Musées Royaux D'Art et d'Histoire - or the Royal Museum of Art and History - in Brussels. It was really great, especially the ambiente: The mueum is in Jubelpark in the great bow and a lot of the rooms inside - since built at the beginning of the 20th century - are Art Nouveau stile. The picture doesn*t really show the truth, it was snowing and really cold, even inside, but the Egyptian and Asian collections pay just as much as the Art Nouveau and Ancient Roman. If we had really wanted to see everything closely, it would have taken eternity, but to have a good overlook and see everything that interested us closer took about three hours. Tonight we go to a party, but of that later! Hugs.Kat.
