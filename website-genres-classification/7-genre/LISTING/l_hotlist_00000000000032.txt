Alta Vista Translation Service 
Translate text from one language to another!
AltaVista's Translation Assistant provides a free service to the Internet community. The world is a big place and, although the Web has helped to bring us all together, until now, we haven't been able to communicate across language barriers. AltaVista and Systran, a leader in the field of Machine Translations, hope to change that.
Biographical Dictionary : Notable citizens of the planet earth 
This dictionary contains biographical information on over 18,000 people from ancient times to the present day. These are the notable men and women who have shaped our world. 
Information contained in the Dictionary includes birth and death years, professions, positions held, literary and artistic works and other achievements. The Dictionary is searchable by these, and other, categories using keywords.
Guide to Australia 
This GUIDE TO AUSTRALIA project aims to compile links to all available on-line information resources about Australia for distribution via World Wide Web. Our aim is that ultimately it will grow into an on-line, hypertext encyclopaedia. Please advise the editors of any pertinent information or service that you think should be included in the Guide. 
Internet Hoax Busters 
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer viruses and Trojans. However, interspersed among real virus notices are computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are still time consuming and costly to handle. At CIAC, we find that we are spending much more time de-bunking hoaxes than handling real virus incidents. This page describes many of the hoax warnings that are found on the Internet today. We will also address some of the history of hoaxes on the Internet, how to identify a new hoax warning, how to identify a validated warning and what to do if you think a message is a hoax. 
Another site worth looking at is http://www.datafellows.com/news/hoax.htm
Mike's Electric Stuff
A totally amazing site for anyone fascinated by electric things.
* Antique Glass stuff 
* Tesla coils and high-voltage stuff 
* Miscellaneous electric & science stuff 
Each of the three main sections has a 'tour' facility for easier navigation through the pages - clicking on the small icons at the corners of each page will move to the next or previous page in that section. 
Milky Way Webpage 
View the Milky Way at 10 million light years from the Earth. Then move through space towards the Earth in successive orders of magnitude until you reach a tall oak tree just outside the buildings of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. After that, begin to move from the actual size of a leaf into a microscopic world that reveals leaf cell walls, the cell nucleus, chromatin, DNA and finally, into the subatomic universe of electrons and protons.
OneLook Dictionaries 
More dictionaries than you could ever need - covering an enormous range of subject areas.
Small Comets 
Every few seconds a "snowball" the size of a small house breaks up as it approaches Earth and deposits a large cloud of water vapor in Earth's upper atmosphere. The addition of quantities of water from space can account for all the water in the oceans, which upsets most previous theorizing about the origin of ocean water.
