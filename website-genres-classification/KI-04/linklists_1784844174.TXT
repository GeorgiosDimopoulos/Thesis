Resources for Writers and Writing Instructors

By Jack Lynch,
 Rutgers University

This page is terribly disorganized; I'm working to clean it up. For now, it's a miscellaneous group of writing resources serving as a supplement to my grammar and style guide. Note that, as a matter of policy, I don't include links to commercial enterprises. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* General Resources: 

* Alt.usage.english newsgroup 
* Keith Ivey's English Usage Page 
* Mark Israel's FAQ for alt.usage.english 
* World Wide Words (Michael Quinion) — An extensive site "devoted to the English language - its history, quirks, curiosities and evolution." Always interesting. 
* English Usage, Style, & Composition — A collection of reference works at Bartleby.com, including American Heritage, Strunk & White, Fowler's King's English, and other indispensable public-domain works. Worth a bookmark. 
* Grammar Resources on the Web — the University of Chicago Writing Program provides annotated links to useful Web sites on grammar and style. Eminently sensible. 

* Rhetoric: 

* The Rhetoric Server (Berkeley) 
* Chiasmus.com (Mardy Grothe) — A deliciously eccentric site on the joys of chiasmus. 
* Sylva Rhetoricae: The Forest of Rhetoric (Gideon Burton, Brigham Young) -- A superb guide to classical rhetoric, with definitions of many rhetorical terms.

* Strunk, The Elements of Style (1918 edition) (Bartleby) 
* H. W. Fowler, The King's English (Bartleby) 
* Guardian Style Guide -- A thorough guide to the house style of The Guardian. American users should note that it's a British publication; all users should note that it settles their own house style, and doesn't pretend to rule on the language as a whole.
