It is customary to invite at least one sibling of your fiancé to be a bridesmaid, and he will invite one sibling of yours to be an usher/groomsman. However, be flexible. You may need to have all three of his sisters in the wedding as well as your Cousin Katrinka with whom you grew up, in order to preserve and build family harmony. posted by Arrange a Wedding at 10:21 AM

Choose your attendants carefully. Include people with whom you are close, and with whom you get along. Don't feel you have to include your boss, work friends or former friends. Don't feel you have to invite someone to participate in the wedding just because you were in theirs, or because they are the spouse or partner of one of your other attendants. While you may want to include good friends who live in distant places, be sure to include local friends who will be available to help you and attend all the pre-wedding festivities. Distant friends might be included in other ways in the wedding. (Both men and women can be ushers, and you may have more ushers than bridesmaids.) posted by Arrange a Wedding at 9:21 AM

So, you've invited your dearest friends to be in your wedding, and they've all accepted. Then you notice that one will be eight months pregnant on your wedding day, one refuses to remove his nose-ring for the wedding, another will be on crutches, one can't afford the dress you've chosen, and another can't get the weekend off from work. Be flexible and do your best to accommodate them. After all, the reason you asked them to be your wedding party is because you love them, even with all their "uniqueness." And in the end, love is all that matters.One of the first things brides-and-grooms-to-be think about is which extra-special friends and relatives they want with them on their wedding day. You might even have pledged to have a certain friend as a bridesmaid or honor attendant, as girls. These are the friends who will share the planning, the parties, and the celebration with you from Day One. Before you rush off with invitations to join the wedding party, you and your fiancé should stop and consider who you REALLY want in your wedding party. You need to think about numbers, (8-12 for a very formal wedding, 4 or fewer for an informal wedding) as well as relationships.(Hint: In general, the fewer bridesmaids you have, the fewer problems you'll have) However, you might need to increase the number for the sake of family harmony, so don't be afraid to do that. posted by Arrange a Wedding at 8:21 AM

Children in the wedding can be charming and usually serve as flower girls, ring bearers, pages or junior ushers and bridesmaids (ages 10 through 13). On the other hand, they can be disruptive and cranky. If you have a niece or nephew who is special to you, by all means have them. Don't go out of your way to find children to invite. If they are too young (under 4, generally) or there are too many of them (6 girl cousins from ages 6 through 10, for example) to include them all, take a pass. posted by Arrange a Wedding at 7:21 AM

carlson craft discount invitation wedding
So, you've invited your dearest friends to be in your wedding, and they've all accepted. Then you notice that one will be eight months pregnant on your wedding day, one refuses to remove his nose-ring for the wedding, another will be on crutches, one can't afford the dress you've chosen, and another can't get the weekend off from work. Be flexible and do your best to accommodate them. After all, the reason you asked them to be your wedding party is because you love them, even with all their "uniqueness." And in the end, love is all that matters.One of the first things brides-and-grooms-to-be think about is which extra-special friends and relatives they want with them on their wedding day. You might even have pledged to have a certain friend as a bridesmaid or honor attendant, as girls. These are the friends who will share the planning, the parties, and the celebration with you from Day One. Before you rush off with invitations to join the wedding party, you and your fiancé should stop and consider who you REALLY want in your wedding party. You need to think about numbers, (8-12 for a very formal wedding, 4 or fewer for an informal wedding) as well as relationships.(Hint: In general, the fewer bridesmaids you have, the fewer problems you'll have) However, you might need to increase the number for the sake of family harmony, so don't be afraid to do that. posted by Arrange a Wedding at 9:21 AM

So, you've invited your dearest friends to be in your wedding, and they've all accepted. Then you notice that one will be eight months pregnant on your wedding day, one refuses to remove his nose-ring for the wedding, another will be on crutches, one can't afford the dress you've chosen, and another can't get the weekend off from work. Be flexible and do your best to accommodate them. After all, the reason you asked them to be your wedding party is because you love them, even with all their "uniqueness." And in the end, love is all that matters.One of the first things brides-and-grooms-to-be think about is which extra-special friends and relatives they want with them on their wedding day. You might even have pledged to have a certain friend as a bridesmaid or honor attendant, as girls. These are the friends who will share the planning, the parties, and the celebration with you from Day One. Before you rush off with invitations to join the wedding party, you and your fiancé should stop and consider who you REALLY want in your wedding party. You need to think about numbers, (8-12 for a very formal wedding, 4 or fewer for an informal wedding) as well as relationships.(Hint: In general, the fewer bridesmaids you have, the fewer problems you'll have) However, you might need to increase the number for the sake of family harmony, so don't be afraid to do that. posted by Arrange a Wedding at 2:21 AM

Children in the wedding can be charming and usually serve as flower girls, ring bearers, pages or junior ushers and bridesmaids (ages 10 through 13). On the other hand, they can be disruptive and cranky. If you have a niece or nephew who is special to you, by all means have them. Don't go out of your way to find children to invite. If they are too young (under 4, generally) or there are too many of them (6 girl cousins from ages 6 through 10, for example) to include them all, take a pass. posted by Arrange a Wedding at 1:21 AM
