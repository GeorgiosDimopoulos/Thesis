 Jem (0 / Music)       
I&#8217;m sitting here waiting for a download to complete listening to the music stream from Jem&#8217;s website, because i can&#8217;t wait to get the CD.
Jem first came to my attention whilst listening to the O.C. soundtrack (&#8221;Just a ride - Jem") many moons ago, gave her 5 stars in iTunes and kinda forgot all about her until i heard her debut single ("They - Jem") on Moyles&#8217; show. And on the basis of hearing those two songs i bought the album, something i never really as it usually takes me a while to really get into an artist enough to buy the album.
Plus, it turns out she&#8217;s welsh, we&#8217;re great.

 Google search never forgets (0 / Life, Work, Smallville)       
I often find myself wondering why i bother paying for webspace to host a blog when i don&#8217;t really use it, sure it kept me busy designing it but since then i&#8217;ve just gotten bored with it, kinda defines what im like really.
So, what have i been upto the last few weeks? I know you&#8217;re all dying to know, but it&#8217;s not all that interesting, since i work nights (7pm-6am mostly) i rarely get the time to go out and do anything, so this week all my days off have been filled with me watching smallville season 1 again.
I have decided to try and eat a bit more healthily and i need to start walking more, seeing as my job involves me sitting down all night drinking coffee, then i go home and watch smallville all day - which makes me into one big couch potato. I&#8217;ve started eating fruit instead of snacks from the vending machine, problem is that fruit never really satisfies me like a big chucky kit-kat does, ho hum.

 Google Whore (0 / Life)       
Just found myself looking around blogger.com and realised that they&#8217;re owned by google, and poking about a bit more i found that you can actually buy google merchandise, who knew?
Which begs me to question, would you wear a google t-shirt, hat, hoodie or fleece?

 Don&#8217;t spit into the wind (1 / Site, Music)       
While buying a few tracks off iTunes (Harry Nilsson - One and Josh Turner - You Don&#8217;t Mess Around With Jim), i&#8217;ve only just noticed that you can preview the songs, id always assumed that this a was a &#8216;missing&#8217; feature seeing as there is no preview button. Oh well.
After spending quite a few weeks on this new design, only after putting it online do i realise that it doesn&#8217;t work at all in internet explorer, not that im too bothered but it&#8217;s just annoying. Plus all my negative margins get mucked up if i add any more links into the sidebar.
Im currently experimenting with parsing xml through php, which if used with a nifty firefox extension would give me a pretty cool links system based on what&#8217;s actually in my bookmarks.

 Buns of steel (0 / Smallville)       
I&#8217;ve just finished watching Unsafe, the latest episode of Smallville to air in the US, and i am so pleased to see Sarah Carter back as Alicia.
Im really enjoying this season of smallville, it&#8217;s not as freak-of-the-week as the earlier seasons but it&#8217;s not as heavily arced like last season, a happy medium i think.
The whole Lana thing is tedious now though, i have no problem in beleiving that clark is an alien from the planet krypton but the arc about Lana being a decendant of some witch is a bit to much. I do like Lois though.
