Scarves  
So I've made a few scarves already, but that's it. I'm still a beginner, but I really like it alot and I want to get better and learn more things. Nobody really needs this many scarves and they're kind of expensive to make, so I can't really give away too many of them, so I've decided to try to sell them and use the money I make from them to buy yarn to make more. So then stuff will just pay for more stuff and I'll never have to stop. I've only sold one so far, (the blue one with ribbons) but I haven't really tried, either. I thought I should get a bunch so there would be a lot of choices. The first one I made, I gave away to a friend for christmas, and then I made one for my girlfriend, and then I made a green one. Then I made one with different colours and a ribbed pattern. Then I started making some with a button so they could go around and close on the side over the shoulder.

The Sock Calculator  
I added a link to the Sock Calculator. I've decided to use this page as sort of a knitting journal. The Calculator is great! It has blank fields to fill out for hieght and circumfrance and stuff and it generates a pattern for custom made socks. Pretty sweet.
