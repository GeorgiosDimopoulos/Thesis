Since 1979 member of the entomological society Entomologischen Verein Apollo e. V., Frankfurt am Main. From 1980 onward increasing responsibility in the editorial board of and building up the journal Nachrichten des Entomologischen Vereins Apollo (NEVA). Since ca. 1985 factually, since September 1990 also officially managing editor of NEVA. 

1985 founding member of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Hessischer Lepidopterologen (Arge HeLep) (study-group of Hessian lepidopterologists) within the I.E.V. In 1997 (after the sudden death of the most active founder Philipp Michael Kristal) elected to one of four equal speakers of the Arge HeLep. 

Since December 1995 I am employed as curator of Section Entomology II within Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt am Main. In mid-1998 I became managing editor of one of the scientific journals of Senckenberg, Senckenbergiana biologica. 

Faunistic activities in Hesse: 
In recent years I worked often also in the area around the place where I live, Mühlheim am Main, 20 km east of Frankfurt, and in neighbouring areas, especially in cooperation with and on behalf of the State Conservancy Administration, in some official nature reserves in the districts Kreis Offenbach and Main-Kinzig-Kreis. It is intended that data collected by me within the municipal forest of Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurter Stadtwald) will be used as arguments to preserve the remnants of valuable forest around the Frankfurt Airport area. Besides memberships in many national and international entomological and biological societies I am also a member in several German nature conservancy societies like Nabu, BUND and HGON. Â— For more details about my activities in nature conservation and related subjects see here (only available in German language). 

Since November 1997 I am deputy member for Senckenberg in the municipal advisory council for nature conservancy problems of Frankfurt am Main (Naturschutzbeirat, 5th period), since December 2001 full member in the 6th period.
