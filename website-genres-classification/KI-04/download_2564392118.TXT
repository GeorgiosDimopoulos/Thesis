R EQUIREMENTS F OR C OMPILING Before you download source code to Ethereal, you may want to verify that the following packages are installed on your system -- they are required in order to compile: GTK+ and GLib, available from the GTK+ site. Version 1.2 or a later 1.2.x release are needed; Ethereal is not guaranteed to compile with 2.x releases of GTK+ or GLib, and there's a good chance that it will not compile. Solaris users should note that at least some versions of the GLib and GTK+ packages from sunfreeware.com have had problems that either cause Ethereal not to build or cause it to crash when run; if the build fails because plugin_list isn't defined, or the build succeeds but Ethereal crashes with a bus error, and you have GLib and GTK+ packages from sunfreeware.com installed, un-install those packages, and try getting the 1.2.10 versions from that site, or the version from The Written Word , or the version from Sun's GNOME distribution, or the version from the supplemental software CD that comes with the Solaris media kit, or build it from source from the GTK Web site . Then re-run the configuration script, and try rebuilding Ethereal. (If you get the 1.2.10 versions from www.sunfreeware.org, and the problem persists, un-install them and try installing one of the other versions mentioned.) The libpcap packet capture library, available for UNIX The Tcpdump Group , if it doesn't come as part of your OS; the Windows port, WinPcap, is available from the WinPcap Web site , as well as from the local mirror of that site or the Wiretapped.net mirror of that site . In Linux distributions that come with libpcap, there are often separate "user" and "developer" packages for libpcap; you will have to install both packages in order to compile Ethereal. On Windows, you will need to install not only the regular WinPcap library, but also the "developer's pack", in order to compile Ethereal. As of Ethereal 0.9.5, you must install WinPcap 2.3 or later, and the corresponding version of the developer's pack, in order to be able to compile Ethereal; it will not compile with older versions of the developer's pack. (The installed version of the developer's pack should be the same version as the version of WinPcap you have installed.) Historical note: If you're running an older version of Ethereal (<= 0.8.1) on Linux, you may want to look at this patch . It fixes a bug in libpcap that can make Ethereal unresponsive during a packet capture. Please note that this patch is for the older version of libpcap from ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov , and not the newer versions on the tcpdump.org site or the modified versions that come with Red Hat Linux. RPMs and SRPMs of the patched libpcap for Red Hat 6.0 and 6.1 can be found on the ftp site . Current versions of Ethereal do not have this problem. Perl is required to build the documentation. Additionally, Ethereal can make use of the zlib, NET-SNMP, and adns libraries if available. Zlib allows Ethereal to read gzip-compressed files on the fly. We strongly suggest that you build Ethereal with zlib 1.1.4 or later; on many platforms, applications built with versions of zlib prior to 1.1.4 may be vulnerable to this security problem . The NET-SNMP (formerly known as UCD SNMP) library enables translation of OIDs to names, and more detailed decoding of variable bindings, using MIB files that come with the NET-SNMP library. We strongly suggest that you build Ethereal with UCD SNMP 4.2.4 or later; Ethereal, if built with earlier versions, can be vulnerable to buffer overflows - see this security advisory . GNU adns allows asynchronous DNS resolution. Normally, Ethereal and Tethereal perform name resolution synchronously, which can slow things down considerably. A Windows version of the library is also available.

REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPILING	 

Before you download source code to Ethereal, you may want to verify that the following packages are installed on your system -- they are required in order to compile:

* GTK+ and GLib, available from the GTK+ site. Version 1.2 or a later 1.2.x release are needed; Ethereal is not guaranteed to compile with 2.x releases of GTK+ or GLib, and there's a good chance that it will not compile.

Solaris users should note that at least some versions of the GLib and GTK+ packages from sunfreeware.com have had problems that either cause Ethereal not to build or cause it to crash when run; if the build fails because plugin_list isn't defined, or the build succeeds but Ethereal crashes with a bus error, and you have GLib and GTK+ packages from sunfreeware.com installed, un-install those packages, and try getting the 1.2.10 versions from that site, or the version from The Written Word, or the version from Sun's GNOME distribution, or the version from the supplemental software CD that comes with the Solaris media kit, or build it from source from the GTK Web site. Then re-run the configuration script, and try rebuilding Ethereal. (If you get the 1.2.10 versions from www.sunfreeware.org, and the problem persists, un-install them and try installing one of the other versions mentioned.) 

* The libpcap packet capture library, available for UNIX The Tcpdump Group, if it doesn't come as part of your OS; the Windows port, WinPcap, is available from the WinPcap Web site, as well as from the local mirror of that site or the Wiretapped.net mirror of that site.

In Linux distributions that come with libpcap, there are often separate "user" and "developer" packages for libpcap; you will have to install both packages in order to compile Ethereal.

On Windows, you will need to install not only the regular WinPcap library, but also the "developer's pack", in order to compile Ethereal. As of Ethereal 0.9.5, you must install WinPcap 2.3 or later, and the corresponding version of the developer's pack, in order to be able to compile Ethereal; it will not compile with older versions of the developer's pack. (The installed version of the developer's pack should be the same version as the version of WinPcap you have installed.)

Historical note: If you're running an older version of Ethereal (<= 0.8.1) on Linux, you may want to look at this patch. It fixes a bug in libpcap that can make Ethereal unresponsive during a packet capture. Please note that this patch is for the older version of libpcap from ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov, and not the newer versions on the tcpdump.org site or the modified versions that come with Red Hat Linux. RPMs and SRPMs of the patched libpcap for Red Hat 6.0 and 6.1 can be found on the ftp site. Current versions of Ethereal do not have this problem.

* Perl is required to build the documentation.

Additionally, Ethereal can make use of the zlib, NET-SNMP, and adns libraries if available.

* Zlib allows Ethereal to read gzip-compressed files on the fly. We strongly suggest that you build Ethereal with zlib 1.1.4 or later; on many platforms, applications built with versions of zlib prior to 1.1.4 may be vulnerable to this security problem.

* The NET-SNMP (formerly known as UCD SNMP) library enables translation of OIDs to names, and more detailed decoding of variable bindings, using MIB files that come with the NET-SNMP library. We strongly suggest that you build Ethereal with UCD SNMP 4.2.4 or later; Ethereal, if built with earlier versions, can be vulnerable to buffer overflows - see this security advisory.

* GNU adns allows asynchronous DNS resolution. Normally, Ethereal and Tethereal perform name resolution synchronously, which can slow things down considerably. A Windows version of the library is also available.
