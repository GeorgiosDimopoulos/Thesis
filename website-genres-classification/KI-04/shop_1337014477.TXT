A "Softer" Playground

Instead of sand, mulch, or wood chips, consider using a 6 to 8 inch layer of washed pea gravel around swingsets and play areas. Critters don't use it as a litter box, it drains quickly, it doesn't get all over the house like sand does, and most importantly, it is much better at dissipating the force of a fall.
