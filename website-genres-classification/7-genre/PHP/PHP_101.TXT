Research interests: Algebraic theory of semigroups, geometric group theory
My main research interests are in semigroup theory and geometric group theory. Some of my particular interests are in the theory of inverse semigroups (essentially semigroups of partial symmetries of mathematical objects) and in the study of algorithmic problems in semigroups and infinite groups. My work uses geometric and topological techniques as well as ideas from automata theory, formal language theory, and mathematical logic.
I am Managing Editor of the International Journal of Algebra and Computation.
