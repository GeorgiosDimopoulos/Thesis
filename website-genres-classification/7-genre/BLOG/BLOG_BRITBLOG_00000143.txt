gay marriage: california edition  
It's been busy at work, and the boyfriend and I have been working to finish up the renovation of our house (it feels endless)...so not much time for blogging lately.However, I have to express joy and some reservations about yesterday's CA court ruling. First the reservations: I fear that court-imposed progress on the equal rights front is not what gay people need just now. Like many others, I am dreading the backlash from this.On a personal note though, I know some of the couples who married during that month of San Francisco-wedding-madness last year, and I know they are thrilled that those ceremonies haven't been rendered meaningless just yet.So, I'll try to look on the bright side and have some hope. Maybe America is ready to begin accepting its gay children...  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 10:21 AM    0 comments

don't be gay in jamaica. they'll kill you  
For years, gay and lesbian travelers have warned each other to avoid the Caribbean island of Jamaica. I knew that the island had a long history of intolerance, but I had no idea it was as bad as this.  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 9:57 AM    0 comments

polygamy again  
I had no idea when I wrote my last post on polygamy that the subject was already a source of debate amongst a bunch of new (to me) bloggers whom I now check regularly.I've avoided commenting on the subject again because I wanted to read what all of these (smart) guys had to say...and also because I wrote my post in something of a vacuum, I was just musing on the topic after reading an article in my hometown paper.The point of my orginal post wasn't to argue that polygamy ought to be outlawed. Rather, I was trying to describe how polygamous cultures function in reality, as opposed to theory. I think Libertarians ought to be skeptical that the dynamics of a polygamous relationship are ever as straightforward as "three consenting adults who want to live as they wish." To the extent that it IS that straightforward, I say hey, go right ahead! I certainly won't stand in the way of anyone else's happiness.However, polygamous relationships create lots of children. Lots. Before you know it, you've got a polygamist Clan; within one generation you've created a culture with inherent power dynamics that lend themselves to abuse.And yes, I believe power/dominance dynamics are inherent in polygamous relationships (whether polygyny or polyandry). It's an economic model: polygamy creates a straightforward imbalance of resources, supply vs. demand. You have only one man, many women want his attention--presto, an imbalance of power.At the same time, in these cultures children become resources. Young, virginal girls are coveted by men in power, who compete with each other to have them. Young boys are more than expendable, they are outright competition for those resources and must be driven out; perpetuating the original imbalance.I've read the journals of my grandmothers who were in polygamous marriages, and what surprised me was that everyone hated it: the wives, the husbands, the kids...Two examples: my paternal grandfather was the 11th child of his father's first--and least favorite--wife. He rarely saw his father growing up (in most cases, the Sister-Wives had their own homes and the husband rotated through, splitting his time). Naturally, my great-grandfather wanted to spend his time with his younger, prettier wives, and my great-grandmother's heart was broken.On the other hand, my paternal grandmother was the second and youngest child of her father's second wife, the favorite wife. She got lots of attention from her father and the lion's share of his resources (his first wife had six children, his second only had two--but the second wife's home was much larger and nicer). You'd think my grandmother's mother would have been happy, right? Wrong. Her journal is just as full of misery, jealousy and unspoken fear as the unloved wife. Why? Even though she was winning, my great-grandmother was still in a competition for resources and this was not lost on her. She did not have power over the distrubution of those resources, and she lived in fear of a younger, prettier wife coming along.Polygamy is ultimately about centralized power and unequal distribution of resources.My own thinking comes down to this. I am a libertarian, and intellectual consistency forces me to acknowledge that grown adults ought to be able to form polygamous relationships if they choose to. However, should that original choice lead to a situation that limits the choices of their children, it is incumbent upon the State to protect those children and ensure that they have the same liberties their parents had--the liberty to make a different choice, if they wish to. In reality, that is rarely the way things turn out for kids born into polygamy.UPDATE: I've pretty much ignored polyandry and the New Polygamy argument, which theoretically could balance the one-man-many-women model with other one-woman-many-men marriages. Again, I'm skeptical. There are few traditions of polyandry, at all, in the history of the world, so to me that conversation seems like a non-starter. If men were willing to put up with that particular imbalance of resources, it would have been tried by now.  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 11:27 AM    4 comments

minorities and movies  
Last night I got sucked into watching a groaner of a movie called "Deliver us from Eva." I ended up watching the whole thing mainly because the stars, Gabrielle Union and LL Cool J, are both so charming...and HOT. They're decent actors too, with a good ensemble cast, and tried gamely to pull off a dreadful script--with only marginal success. The plot was so thin and implausible, the characters so one-dimensional and the ending so formulaic that it could almost be a case study in bad script writing. When the movie came out, it was marketed as a "Black Movie," and by that I mean it wasn't universally promoted like most top-billed studio films, it was marketed mainly in heavily black urban markets, on black radio and media outlets, etc. Watching it reminded me of aalllllll the bad "Gay Movies" I've seen over the years ("Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss," "Jeffrey," "Go fish!"), movies that are only marketed to gays, because, quite frankly, they aren't good enough to have mass-market appeal. I am bummed when I see such films because I feel like they further marginalize an already marginalized group.All of this got me thinking...why do movies targeted at minorities suck so bad? Are there slots in the studio production line and they just fill them in with any old script that comes along? (2005: make 6 Black Movies, 3 Gay Movies, 4 Latin Movies...) Is it so studios can avoid accusations of discrimination ("See! We made a Black Film")? Or does someone, somewhere, actually think these stories are great and people will love them? These questions are not rhetorical. I honestly wonder.What's obvious though, is that awful, awful scripts are getting greenlighted. When minority-themed movies are good, or even just entertaining, they have crossover appeal and are successully mass-marketed (a la "The Birdcage," "What's Love Got to Do With It," "Waiting to Exhale"). Is it only in post-production, when everyone realizes a movie is a stinker, that they decide to market the final product to a sliver-sized target audience?Perhaps what I'm displaying in this post is a lack of sophistication with the studio process. Maybe studios wish to groom aspiring directors and give them small niche-product movies to learn the ropes. Maybe there just aren't that many good minority-themed scripts out there, and the best of them are being made (I find that hard to believe). Maybe these bad movies are a by-product of well-intentioned studio execs who just don't "get it." Maybe it's a result of some affirmative-action misfire that allows the very schlockiest minority scripts to get budget approval regardless of quality?Or maybe it's some combination of all of these. Anyone have any ideas?  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 9:20 AM    0 comments

brave new world  
This article from the Jerusalem Post on new, biometric computers caught my eye. Scientists in Israel have built a biological computer â€“ composed entirely of DNA molecules and enzymes on a gold-coated chip.Are you wondering, like I was, what the real-world application of such a device might be? Here's the last paragraph:
Shapiro and his research team are attempting to identify signs of specific cancers in a test tube, to diagnose the type of cancer and to release drug molecules in response. Although cancer-detecting computers are still in the very early stages and can, thus far, only function in test tubes, he and his colleagues envision future biomolecular devices that may be injected directly into the human body to detect and prevent or cure disease.
Sounds like science fiction, right? I've often thought that one of the great aspects of the science fiction genre is that it allows our collective psyche to absorb wild, far-out ideas before we develop real-life counterparts to them. Shows like "Star Trek" are cheesy, for sure, but they let us inhabit an imaginary world that contains biological computers, so we don't freak out when they suddenly pop up in the real world.  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 1:23 PM    1 comments    
bush to cut cotton subsidies?  
From the WaPo. I remain skeptical; the cotton industry has one of the largest and slickest lobbying shops around and there's never been an administration more beholden to large corporate interests. This will face stiff resistance from Southern republicans, who see cotton growers as both donors and political allies.Still, if it's true, and W really IS taking some cost-cutting risks in his second term, it can only be a good thing. Here's hoping!  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 9:33 AM    0 comments

queer friends for the straight guy  
Off-topic but related to the post below, here's a phenomenon I've been talking about for awhile: a Gay Friend is the accessory du jour for straight, male urban sophisticates.The gay friend (usually male) has long been a staple accessory for hip, single urban women (think "Sex and the City"), but in the last few years our fashionability has crossed the gender barrier. In taking us up as friends, straight guys haved also upped the ante by including our gay sisters in the accessory lineup.These days, all a single straight guy has to do to make a favorable impression is mention casually that he has one or two gay friends (best case scenario is a Lesbian sister whom he adores, but we can't always choose, can we?). With that pronouncement, the straight guy has instantly demonstrated several things: 1) Urban Cool - "I know where the best clubs are"; 2) Comfort with his Masculinity - "What, me threatened? No way!"; 3) Independence - "I don't take my marching orders from 'the Man'"; 4) Cultural Sensitivity - "I'm down with equality. Hey, I might even do the dishes."By demonstrating his ease around gay people, the straight guy has also put final confirmation on the fact that he IS straight. It's virtually impossible for a closeted gay person to be friendly with gay people who are out. Ease with this issue reassures everyone involved.You think I'm kidding, but I'm not. For years, the refrain gays have heard from our straight, single gal-pals is, "Why can't the men I date be more like You!" What they mean isn't what they think they mean...even the most modern girl still wants a rugged, big-M Man to settle down with. They certainly don't want someone prissy, or self-conscious.What urban women want is a Modern Man--a guy who is masculine and down-to-earth, but not so caught up in stereotyped sex roles that he can't enjoy foreign films or talk about his feelings occasionally. They want a man who will fix a flat, but who loves sushi and doesn't feel the need to make himself look big by making others look small.Ironically, in Blue-state cities like DC and New York, the gay friend is an especially critical accessory for the urban man whose politics are right-of-center. It gets him off the hook,"Yes, I vote Republican, but for me it's about taxes. See? I have gay friends! I'm a good guy!"What better way is there to convey one's hipness and sensitivity than by having the new urban man's accessory - a gay friend?  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 4:31 PM    0 comments    
i smell a tipping point  
I, like everyone gay person who dabbles in the blogosphere, have had my share to say about gay issues lately. In fairness, there's been a lot to say. I can't remember any other Presidential election when gay issues were even rumored to impact the result...can you?However you trace the evolution of it, "gay" is having its cultural moment right now. Well, Brothers and Sisters, we should grab our moment while we can because the wave has crested and I believe we'll soon be out. Like, Out. Like pegged 501's and Penny Loafers. Remember, you read it here first!For me, the jump-the-shark moment for gay issues' relevance in the American consciousness was the whole James Dobson/SpongeBob-Margaret Spellings/Buster the Bunny confluence. Americans, collectively, took one look at these pseudo-controversies and the combination of earnestness and duncery displayed by their perpetrators, and rolled their eyes. I mean, the new threat to family-value wholesomeness is...a couple of kids' cartoons? Come on. Maybe there were two Home-Schooling Christian Moms in Tulsa who saw these tidbits covered in the media and took them seriously, but the rest of us just felt impatient. Wha-huh? In 21st century America, with war, famine, AIDS, bird flus, terrorists, and oil at $60 a barrel this shit still makes the papers?The fact is, in many spheres of American life, "gay" just isn't that big a deal anymore. There are still issues to work out (let's face it, many tolerant straight people are still uncomfortable with gays being their true equals in the eyes of the law), but for the most part the cultural conversation debating those issues is well under way. Futhermore, I submit that the resolution to these lingering issues of equality will come very quickly, historically speaking. Americans are not stupid or malicious, and in every Civil Rights conversation of the past 60 years, once people have hashed the issues out across the dinner table and with friends, the concensus has moved in the direction of greater liberty for all.I'm not saying gay marriage or civil unions will come tomorrow, or even within the next election cycle. But I am saying political strategists in the next go-'round will have a much harder time using gay issues to fire up their base. It's just so done already. Next.  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 3:31 PM    0 comments

topsy-turvy world  
Man, we're through the looking glass now, aren't we? Here comes Ann Coulter accusing Liberals of Homophobia. She also helpfully clarifies that not all Conservatives actually want gay people to, you know, die.I think I need to sit down for a minute.UPDATE: Via Media Matters, I learn that this olive-branch from Dan Savage to Christian conservatives is the "homophobic editorial" Ann is referring to that "outed" gay children of prominent conservatives. Except, um, they all outed themselves.  posted by Mr. Riddle @ 2:51 PM    2 comments
