Women have dildos, men have...
March 14, 2005 
One of the things I loved about Sex And The City (aside from Miranda *sigh*) was the aspect of eavesdropping on women talking honestly about their sex lives. Only slightly tainted by the reality that it was probably crafted by a crew of gay male writers living in Los Angeles. 
Fortunately, the blogosphere comes to the rescue with this revelation on what South African women talk about in the office: dildos. A singularly fascinating conversation that's all the better for feeling real, and not being crafted for a mass audience.
What does amuse/amaze me is the laissez-faire manner in which women seemingly talk about their sex toys (although I'm surrounded by women at work and I've yet to hear them discussing dildos). You won't catch men crowding round the water cooler discussing their sex toys - mainly because they don't have any aside from Penthouse, but also because it's just not done, man. Would men want/need sex toys anyway?
I've never really seen the point of dildos either (I mean, as a device ... I've seen a few dildos in my time, thanks to the lesbian ex-flatmates). You can't get more artificial than a dildo in terms of placing it inside or around small intimate areas. Surely even a cucumber would at least have that sheen of all-to-goodness nature around it?

RIP Dave Allen - who made my Dad and I laugh
March 12, 2005 
Unfortunately, legendary comedian Dave Allen has died. I shall leave it to others to pay tribute to his comic genius, but I'm mourning the loss of quite possibly the only man who made my father and I laugh at the same time. 
It's alas a cliche to say that fathers and sons in second-generation immigrant families rarely understand each other. My Dad still has no idea what I really do for a living, and just tells people I do computer stuff. He doesn't see the point in reading books (except to go to University and become a doctor) and my interest in comedy he just considers juvenile and silly. (He probably has a point).
One time, he came in after a hard evening at work, to find me watching a Dave Allen tape, at a point when Dave was listing the absurdities of the ways in which we tell the time ... ("see, now there's a third hand, which we call the second hand.") - and all of a sudden, with my laughter I could hear my Dad howling away. Which I haven't really heard before or since.

The uselessness of surveys
March 09, 2005 
Accoridng to DietTracker, Cardiff women (on average) take 78 minutes to have sex/sexercise. In the same survey, the most active men (Bristolians) take 44 minutes.
The survey doesn't ask what the women are doing for sexercise in the 34 minutes that they're having sex while the men are presumably watching football and drinking beer. I'm assuming we're talking heterosexual sex here, although there's no good reason to assume that, to be honest.
So what would you do in that extra 34 minutes?

*croak*
March 08, 2005 
Still ill. Apparently I have tonsilitis - just my luck.
And i only discovered this after calling NHS Direct, and them saying I should call my out-of-hours GP. Apparently it was that important. So I got in my car and drove to the hospital, visions of being diagnosed with mumps, hepatitis or something equally horrific. And after paying Â£2.10 to park in the hospital car park (who said the NHS was free these days ?!), and waiting 45 minutes in a very cold and chilly room, the GP sauntered over, shoved two huge sticks in my mouth and while I wailed in agony and caught a bit of Cat People on the monitor above my head, she hrmmed and said tonsilitis, threw me some penicillin and told me to go. Bit of an anti-climax.
Still, it's been quasi-interesting staying at home shivering, and watching as news spreads of the leaked Doctor Who episode onto t'Internet. I like to think of myself as a pretty tech-savvy bloke who knows about Bittorrent, but I still haven't found it yet. Not that I'd download it, of course.

I can't eat, I can't sleep any more...
March 04, 2005 
But alas, I'm not in love - which is probably a good thing since I can't swallow either.
(Warning: this is the mandatory bloggers' "I'm feeling so ill, sooo ill" type-post. Feel free to ignore.)

You're not Welsh unless you have a red rugby top
In Swansea, a city not exactly renown for good race relations, a Bangladeshi baby was refused a free St David's photo on the grounds it was wearing a yellow daffodil, and not a red Welsh rugby top.
The council's response is priceless in its sneering attitude, and inability to understand just what the problem is - "The decision she made is a matter for her."
If you're offering free photos for kids on St. Davids Day, then surely having a daffodil is just as justifiable (and a damn site cheaper) as a red Welsh rugby top? I really can't see the problem the council would have had in taking one more picture of a baby wearing a daffodil instead of a rugby top.
Mind you, it probably didn't help that the baby and mother were Bangladeshi.

Squirming at teen movies
March 03, 2005 
One time, my flatmate put on a Swedish teenage lesbian melodrama, which was utterly predictable - and also totally emotionally squirmy. So much so, that I had to leave the room.
There was no "hot" lesbian action in the film - just two teenagers from different sides of the popularity tracks slowly fumbling towards their feelings for each other. But for some reason, the sheer emotional nudity on show - plus all that mawkish teenage sentiment really had me on edge. It's been the same with pretty much all films with teenagers in a high school - even the comedies. I still haven't seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off, or The Sure Thing.
Why this is, I wouldn't even like to begin to speculate. My childhood wasn't terrible by any means - I'm still friends with a few of my childhood pals. I had a few embarassing moments, but haven't we all... Maybe I hate emotional melodrama...

Car calamities
March 02, 2005 
I don't know why I bothered owning a car. I just don't.
I had to renew my car tax. Which unfortunately involves presenting your car insurance and MOT (car roadworthiness) documents.
This sorry saga starts when I realise that despite diligent paperwork filing procedures (it all goes in a huge pile), I had lost said documents. So I applied to get new insurance documents - this took ten days to arrive, on the day my car tax ran out.
So I go to the post office to renew my car tax, and after spending 20 mintues smelling wee and pee everywhere (top tip: Do not go to the Post Office on a Monday morning, there's shuffling old people everywhere) the lady at the counter helpfulyl tells me that i also need my MOT documentation. Which seems to have gone the way of the original car insurance documents.
So I take the car to work, to get the car checked over by the MOT people. And they inform me that it's failed, because of two bald tyres and that they couldn't do the emissions test because, and I quote, "they couldn't find the engine". It's the big huge block under the bonnet!
So I get to the car, at which point it's pouring with rain and hailstoning. Get in the car, reverse to get out, and somehow manage to ram the side of a golden car that had suddenly appeared out of the mist. To top it all, the car belongs to a Very Important Work Person. But since I confessed all, my karma is good.
Unfortunately, my bank balance won't be. Due to all these snafus, I've had to declare the vehicle off-road until it can pass its MOT. And I'll have to pay for the damage to the car. Not to mention the forthcoming fine for not having car tax in the first place.
Did I mention I hate cars?

People mangling Welsh...
March 01, 2005 
Once in a while, when I feel like I know what I'm doing (or it's a special day like today - St. Davids Day, patron saint of Wales etc.), I'll occasionally dare to utter a sentence or two in Welsh instead of English when speaking to an appropriate person who would understand what I'm saying.
And then I'll get th impression that I sound a tad pretentious, presumptious and silly. After all, if someone dropped a Chinese phrase into a mostly-English conversation, my head would jerk back and I'd be mildly annoyed or piqued.
Is it just me, or do English speakers who drop in a line of Welsh sound silly/stupid/arrogant when doing so?
Oh, and hello to the various Cymru philes out there!
