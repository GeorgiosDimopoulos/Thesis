Red Hot Saints Blow Salford AwaySaints 46 Salford City Reds 12With a devastating first-half display Saints ended any chance of a surprise defeat to a Salford side who had started the season strongly, but were outplayed and outclassed. After scoring three tries in the last six minutes last week, Saints carried on in rich vein scoring six tries without reply. Jamie Lyon scored his first try for Saints from Long's grubber after just three minutes, and Salford responded with a short period of Salford pressure which ultimately came to nothing despite forcing two drop-outs. Unfortunately for the vocal contingent of Salford fans, that was their chance to impose themselves on the game, and they had failed to take it. Talau scored after fifteen minutes as the Salford defence hesitated, assuming that the New Zealand centre was a dummy runner. Saints third try was the pick of the bunch: Paul Anderson put Gilmour through a gap in his own half and the second-rower continued his arcing run before passing inside for Long to score from 10 metres. If that try was well crafted, the next was gifted to Saints as Salford made a horrendous mess of Vinnie Anderson's high kick. Darren Albert was the lucky recipient, continuing his run of scoring in every Super League match this season. Coach Ian Millward had promised that when Saints had dry conditions they could overwhelm any defence, and so it was proving as Super League's second meanest defence was carved open at will. Lyon's second try of the night began with a Salford kick, taken by Wellens just inside his own half. He moved right and released Albert, who found a gap and sprinted clear before passing inside to the Australian centre. Long scored another on the stroke of half-time, and Sculthorpe's touchline conversion maintained his perfect record, as Saints went in with a 36-0 lead. The second half was always likely to be something of an anti-climax as Saints played into a strong wind and Salford defended with some resolution. Gardner scored his first try of the season, spinning out of the tackle and forcing his way over, before two Salford tries in five minutes gave the scoreline a more respectable look. First Baldwin touched down, from a pass that looked suspiciously forward, then Alker scored after Long's handling error had given Salford territory and possession. Saints had a poor completion rate in the second half, in part because they looked to be too expansive, but they did manage to create one more try as Keiron Cunningham jinked over with the Salford defence stretched. Roby then had a try disallowed which would've brought up Saints' first half-century of points in 14 matches – a surprising statistic for such an attacking side – but the touch judge spotted a knock-on in the build-up. Despite that, it was an excellent performance from the Saints who are coming in to some good form ahead of the difficult Easter weekend.The return of Long and Sculthorpe provided direction and a cutting edge in attack, while the partnership between Lyon and Albert continues to sparkle. Debutant Vinnie Anderson also showed some good touches in his first match of 2005

The City of Lights  
Tonight I went a little further than last week's 14 miler along Norlands Lane.Instead of carrying on up Chapel Lane from Lowfield Lane I turned left into Sutton Manor and went up Jubits Lane, over the motorway bridge and eventually rejoined Norlands to continue the run.I'd decided to take my radio rather than my MP3 player, bad mistake.All the sport had finished on Radio 5 live and I was left with newshour.A 2 hour long show about death,destruction and crime.Why is it 'news' always has to be bad? ...it sapped the life out of me so I ended up flicking through the stations, first was Radio 1's 'hardcore' with it's selection of dance music.Chicane,orbital,the orb etc etc...they all sounded like a heart monitor with a car alram going off in the background. I listened for a bit out of sheer disbelief before finding a country and western station.This too started to draw the life out of me with dreary songs about a suicidal one legged poker player. Eventually I settled on the local Radio City...it was request time and there were some songs I at least recognised by Snow Patrol,the Killers and Keane.I'd taken some dried fruit in my pocket to keep the energy levels going but it never worked.I hit 'the wall' about 10 miles in and decided to make my way over the fields off Cumber Lane. There are newly laid footpaths and I'd occasionally startle some rabbits hanging around each bend.At the top is the hilly field just off Stoney Lane.At the very top is the ordinance survey cairn that lets you look out over all Merseyside .On a starless night like this the view is spectacular ,it looks like the sky has fallen down with a billion stars littering the ground .From Liverpool sweeping south along the Mersey estuary to Runcorn with it's glowing bridge.Then it was a dire plod back along Rainhill Road,through Nutgrove then home.A fitful,tough 15 miles but it's done.More miles in the bank for the Shakespeare Marathon.

Northern Lights  
Found this great website for watching the Northern Lights.Their video gallery is wonderful.We only get a fleeting glimpse this far south, it may be colder up north but what a gorgeous trade off.
