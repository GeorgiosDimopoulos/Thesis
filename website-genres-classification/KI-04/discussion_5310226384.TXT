This is a 1993 GM Safari XT with a 4.3 V6 I did not have the means to check the fuel pressure but what I did do to check I turned the ignition on but did not start the engine until the fuel pump stopped ,about 4 seconds,pressed the little shraeder type valve that the pressure guage would connect to see if any pressure had built up.there was no type of pressure released.I tried this little test about three times. I do have spark.I removed a spark plug reconnected the plug wire,grounded the plug then cranked the engine,It showed good spark. Again I did not have a way to check for compression but I am working on it. The way I checked to see if the cylinders where getting any fuel was by cranking the engine and removing a plug to see if there was any wetness from fuel. My plugs where dry.That was when I suspected the Fuel Infection Unit. I first suspected the fuel pump because the van was running fine then all of a sudden started to jerk like it was running out of fuel but the fuel guage read at a quater tank.I added fuel to the tank to see if maybe my guage was faulty but no change.The van would start and idle but when you pressed the accelerator the engine would stall.I tried starting it again after it stalled it wouldn't start.I let it set a little while,started it again,it would start but only idle and not accelerate.I let it sit over night before I towed it home from where it was.It started, I did not touch the accelerator on the tow home so steering and braking would be easier.It eventually died on the way home and never started again since. I had this happen before when it would idle but not accelerate without stalling and be hard to start again.I changed the fuel pump and the engine started right up and ran fine. This second time I thought I had replaced the first fuel pump with a cheap ( Auto#@ $ @) fuel pump so I Upgraded the pump to a better fuel pump from a local specialty parts store. I have replaced the coil,distributor cap and rotor and ignition module.I also tested the fusible links located behind the battery.I tested it with a continuity tester,one end connected to the positive terminal,the other end pierced the insulation past the fuse link.The light came on with all four wires coming out of the power distribution block. Thanks for any help you can give me! Last edited by brikstak on 08-22-2003 at 10:37 PM .

Using your advise, Last night I pulled the tank again to see if the fuel pump might be the problem.I dropped it and pulled it out with the wiring still connected,like I did before,to test and see if I am getting fuel.I turned the key to activate the pump,I could hear the pump but no fuel was coming out. I pulled the pump out, thinking I bought a faulty pump.When I inspected the pump I noticed the fuel line to the engine was partially out of the rubber grommet ( for a lack of the real technical term) connecting to the pump.I reconnected everything and the van started.What blows me away is that I did this check before to make sure my fuel pump was working,and it was.It looks like it worked it's way out because I didn't insert the fuel line far enough when I changed it.I think I know why mechanics charge so much,To pay for all the testing equipment.

What year,engine size? What is your fuel pressure? Do you have spark? Do you have compression? What was your diagnosis to lead you to replace the fuel pump initially?
